19207984,"Morphometric variability of minicolumns in the striate cortex of Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta, and Pan troglodytes.","['Casanova MF', 'Trippe J 2nd', 'Tillquist C', 'Switala AE']",Journal of anatomy,2009,"Radially oriented ensembles of neurons and their projections, termed minicolumns, are hypothesized to be the basic microcircuit of mammalian cerebral cortex. Minicolumns can be divided into a core and a peripheral neuropil space compartment. The core of minicolumns is constrained by the migratory path of pyramidal cells and their attendant radially oriented projections. Variation in minicolumnar morphometry and density is observed both within and across species. Using a scale-independent measure of variability in minicolumnar width (V(CW)), we demonstrated a significant increase in V(CW) in layers III-V of striate cortex in humans relative to macaques and chimpanzees. Despite changes in minicolumnar width (CW) across species, their core space (w) remained the same. Given that cellular elements and processes within the peripheral neuropil space of minicolumns are derived from assorted sources, cross-species differences in VCW may result from genetic and epigenetic influences acting primarily on this compartment of the minicolumn.",2.097,460
25425018,Genome wide in silico analysis of Plasmodium falciparum phosphatome.,"['Pandey R', 'Mohmmed A', 'Pierrot C', 'Khalife J', 'Malhotra P', 'Gupta D']",BMC genomics,2014,"BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cellular machineries are intricately regulated by several molecular mechanisms involving transcriptional control, post-translational control and post-translational modifications of proteins (PTMs). Reversible protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process, which involves kinases as well as phosphatases, represents an important regulatory mechanism for diverse pathways and systems in all organisms including human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Earlier analysis on P. falciparum protein-phosphatome revealed presence of 34 phosphatases in Plasmodium genome. Recently, we re-analysed P. falciparum phosphatome aimed at identifying parasite specific phosphatases. RESULTS: Plasmodium database (PlasmoDB 9.2) search, combined with PFAM and CDD searches, revealed 67 candidate phosphatases in P. falciparum. While this number is far less than the number of phosphatases present in Homo sapiens, it is almost the same as in other Plasmodium species. These Plasmodium phosphatase proteins were classified into 13 super families based on NCBI CDD search. Analysis of proteins expression profiles of the 67 phosphatases revealed that 44 phosphatases are expressed in both schizont as well as gametocytes stages. Fourteen phosphatases are common in schizont, ring and trophozoite stages, four phosphatases are restricted to gametocytes, whereas another three restricted to schizont stage. The phylogenetic trees for each of the known phosphatase super families reveal a considerable phylogenetic closeness amongst apicomplexan organisms and a considerable phylogenetic distance with other eukaryotic model organisms included in the study. The GO assignments and predicted interaction partners of the parasite phosphatases indicate its important role in diverse cellular processes. CONCLUSION: In the study presented here, we reviewed the P. falciparum phosphatome to show presence of 67 candidate phosphatases in P. falciparum genomes/proteomes. Intriguingly, amongst these phosphatases, we could identify six Plasmodium specific phosphatases and 33 putative phosphatases that do not have human orthologs, thereby suggesting that these phosphatases have the potential to be explored as novel antimalarial drug targets.",3.986,878

The efficacy of selection in removing deleterious mitochondrial mutations from populations depends on the effective population size (Ne) of the mitochondrial DNA and the degree to which a lack of recombination magnifies the effects of linked selection. Using complete mitochondrial genomes from Drosophila melanogaster and nuclear data available from the same samples, we reexamine the hypothesis that nonrecombining animal mitochondrial DNA harbor an excess of deleterious polymorphisms relative to the nuclear genome. We find no evidence of recombination in the mitochondrial genome, and the much-reduced level of mitochondrial synonymous polymorphism relative to nuclear genes is consistent with a reduction in Ne. Nevertheless, we find that the neutrality index, a measure of the excess of nonsynonymous polymorphism relative to the neutral expectation, is only weakly significantly different between mitochondrial and nuclear loci. This difference is likely the result of the larger proportion of beneficial mutations in X-linked relative to autosomal loci, and we find little to no difference between mitochondrial and autosomal neutrality indices. Reanalysis of published data from Homo sapiens reveals a similar lack of a difference between the two genomes, although previous studies have suggested a strong difference in both species. Thus, despite a smaller Ne, mitochondrial loci of both flies and humans appear to experience similar efficacies of purifying selection as do loci in the recombining nuclear genome.",0,31

The present study evaluated the potential of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome B (cytb) gene to differentiate between vertebrate species that were identified as possible sources of sandfly meals. The complete cytb gene sequences of 11 vertebrate species available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database were digested with Aci I, Alu I, Hae III and Rsa I restriction enzymes in silico using Restriction Mapper software. The cytb gene fragment (358 bp) was amplified from tissue samples of vertebrate species and the dietary contents of sandflies and digested with restriction enzymes. Vertebrate species presented a restriction fragment profile that differed from that of other species, with the exception of Canis familiaris and Cerdocyon thous. The 358 bp fragment was identified in 76 sandflies. Of these, 10 were evaluated using the restriction enzymes and the food sources were predicted for four: Homo sapiens (1), Bos taurus (1) and Equus caballus (2). Thus, the PCR-RFLP technique could be a potential method for identifying the food sources of arthropods. However, some points must be clarified regarding the applicability of the method, such as the extent of DNA degradation through intestinal digestion, the potential for multiple sources of blood meals and the need for greater knowledge regarding intraspecific variations in mtDNA.",1.592,943

Significant controversy has arisen regarding this species. To address controversial issues and refocus investigations, I examine the affinities of these remains with Homo sapiens. Clarification of problematic issues is sought through an integration of genetic and physiological data on brain ontogeny and evolution. Clarification of the taxonomic value of various 'primitive' traits is possible given these data. Based on this evidence and using a H. sapiens morphological template, models are developed to account for the combination of features displayed in the Flores fossils. Given this overview, I find substantial support for the hypothesis that the remains represent a variant of H. sapiens possessing a combined growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis modification and mutation of the MCPH gene family. Further work will be required to determine the extent to which this variant characterized the population.",3.232,261
10682401,"[They thought; therefore, they spoke].",[],Anales de la Real Academia Nacional de Medicina,1999,"All functions that characteristically define each form of life are the consequence of the unpredictable process of evolution. The appearance around 300,000 years ago of a complex system of language allowed the homo sapiens to verbally express his thoughts, feelings and experiences in a narrative manner. Thus began the great and continuous development of knowledge and the subsequent post-biological improvement of cognitive functions as a consequence of the stimulation of brain plasticity. This complex process vas not rapid. Important structural and functional craneofacial and pharyngo-laryngeal changes were necessary. Some were already present four million years ago in the australopitecus and became more efficient in homo erectus to reach the definite dimensions of modern humans 125,000 years ago in the homo sapiens-sapiens. From then on a continuous, productive and interactive relationship between the ability to think and the capacity to speak was established. New anonymous ideas invent their corresponding words which, in turn, create more complex sequential thoughts. The fundamental contribution of language in the development of human intelligence raises the question fo which of the two functions preceded the other or whether they both evolved simultaneously. Is it possible to assume that if the pharyngo-laryngeal structures ad not evolved at all, the brain would have invented another type of language?",0,1619

The human remains (a distal phalanx, a lower right third molar and a lower right second deciduous incisor) do not show diagnostic morphological features that could be used to determine whether they were from Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens. Despite being of small size, and thus more similar to recent H. sapiens, the specimens were attributed to Neandertals, primarily because they were found in Mousterian layers. We carried out a taxonomic reassessment of the lower right third molar (LRM3; San Bernardino 4) using digital morphometric analysis of the root, ancient DNA analysis, carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, and direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of dentine collagen. Mitochondrial DNA analysis and root morphology show that the molar belongs to a modern human and not to a Neandertal. Carbon 14 ((14)C) dating of the molar attributes it to the end of the Middle Ages (1420-1480 cal AD, 2 sigma). Carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses suggest that the individual in question had a diet similar to that of Medieval Italians. These results show that the molar, as well as the other two human remains, belong to recent H. sapiens and were introduced in the Mousterian levels post-depositionally.",3.733,559

The palatal size of Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens, Australopithecus afarensis, Australopithecus africanus, Australopithecus robustus, Australopithecus boisei, Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and Cro-Magnon has been investigated using euclidian distance matrix analysis (EDMA) and thin-plate-spline analysis. The results show that the palatal size of all australopithecine specimens and H. erectus is very similar to that of P toglodytes, whereas the palatal size of H. neanderthalensis more closely resembles that of H. sapiens. Postnatal development of palatal size in P troglodytes is different from that of H. sapiens. In P troglodytes not only the size of the palate changes but also the form. In H. sapiens there is little change in form, but a continuos uniform growth from infantile to adult specimens. From the results we conclude that in all australopithecine samples which have been investigated, the palatal size is similar to that of P troglodytes. Therefore, it is unlikely that austraopithecine individuals were capable of producing vowels and consonants. The palatal size of H. neandethalensis and Cro-Magnon is similar to that of H. sapiens which may indicate the possibility that they were capable of speech production.",1.483,244

The main question is whether they can copy others' actions, as opposed to reproducing the environmental effects of these actions using their own preexisting behavioral strategies. In the current study, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and human children (Homo sapiens) were shown different demonstrations of how to open a tube-in both cases by a conspecific. In different experimental conditions, demonstrations consisted of (1) action only (the actions necessary to open the tube without actually opening it); (2) end state only (the open tube, without showing any actions); (3) both of these components (in a full demonstration); or (4) neither of these components (in a baseline condition). In the first three conditions subjects saw one of two different ways that the tube could open (break in middle; caps off ends). Subjects' behavior in each condition was assessed for how often they opened the tube, how often they opened it in the same location as the demonstrator, and how often they copied the demonstrator's actions or style of opening the tube. Whereas chimpanzees reproduced mainly the environmental results of the demonstrations (emulation), human children often reproduced the demonstrator's actions (imitation). Because the procedure used was similar in many ways to the procedure that Meltzoff (Dev Psych 31:1, 1995) used to study the understanding of others' unfulfilled intentions, the implications of these findings with regard to chimpanzees' understanding of others' intentions are also discussed.",2.582,383

 Series B, Biological sciences",2016,"Older evolutionary scenarios for the origin of vertebrates often gave nervous systems top billing in accordance with the notion that a big-brained Homo sapiens crowned a tree of life shaped mainly by progressive evolution. Now, however, tree thinking positions all extant organisms equidistant from the tree's root, and molecular phylogenies indicate that regressive evolution is more common than previously suspected. Even so, contemporary theories of vertebrate origin still focus on the nervous system because of its functional importance, its richness in characters for comparative biology, and its central position in the two currently prominent scenarios for the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition, which grew out of the markedly neurocentric annelid and enteropneust theories of the nineteenth century. Both these scenarios compare phyla with diverse overall body plans. This diversity, exacerbated by the scarcity of relevant fossil data, makes it challenging to establish plausible homologies between component parts (e.g. nervous system regions). In addition, our current understanding of the relation between genotype and phenotype is too preliminary to permit us to convert gene network data into structural features in any simple way. These issues are discussed here with special reference to the evolution of nervous systems during proposed transitions from invertebrates to vertebrates.",2.147,745

Both the cysteine-rich region of SIAH-1 and the PxVxAxP motif of HPH2 were essential for the interaction. HPH2 was co-localized with SIAH-1 in nuclei. Furthermore, SIAH-1 was able to facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of HPH2 via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in vivo. The ubiquitination activity was severely impaired in the SIAH-1 mutant that either lost E3 ligase activity or had weakened binding ability with HPH2, strongly suggesting that SIAH-1 was the direct E3 ligase of HPH2.

This leads to potent and sustained signal attenuation, growth arrest, and angiostasis. We thus sought to evaluate the tumoricidal benefits of systemic decorin on a triple-negative orthotopic breast carcinoma xenograft model. To this end, we employed a novel high-density mixed expression array capable of differentiating and simultaneously measuring gene signatures of both Mus musculus (stromal) and Homo sapiens (epithelial) tissue origins. We found that decorin protein core modulated the differential expression of 374 genes within the stromal compartment of the tumor xenograft. Further, our top gene ontology classes strongly suggests an unexpected and preferential role for decorin protein core to inhibit genes necessary for immunomodulatory responses while simultaneously inducing expression of those possessing cellular adhesion and tumor suppressive gene properties. Rigorous verification of the top scoring candidates led to the discovery of three genes heretofore unlinked to malignant breast cancer that were reproducibly found to be induced in several models of tumor stroma. Collectively, our data provide highly novel and unexpected stromal gene signatures as a direct function of systemic administration of decorin protein core and reveals a fundamental basis of action for decorin to modulate the tumor stroma as a biological mechanism for the ascribed anti-tumorigenic properties.",3.234,1387

Surprisingly, there is no publication that describes all the pectoral and forelimb muscles of this species or provides a comparative framework between these muscles and those of other model organisms and of modern humans. In the present paper we describe and illustrate all these muscles in A. mexicanum and provide the first report about the myology of adults of a model organism that is based on analyses and dissections of both wildtype animals and transgenic animals that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in muscle fibers. On the one hand, the inclusion of GFP-transgenic animals allows us to show the muscles as more commonly seen, and thus easier to understand, by current developmental and regenerative biologists. On the other hand, by including wildtype and GFP-transgenic animals and by visualizing these latter animals with and without a simultaneous transmission laser light, we were able to obtain a more complete and clearer understanding of the exact limit of the fleshy and tendinous parts of the muscles and their specific connections with the skeletal elements. This in turn allowed us to settle some controversies in previous anatomical and comparative studies. As most developmental, regenerative and evolutionary biologists are interested in comparing their observations of A. mexicanum with observations in other model organisms, and ultimately in using this information to increase the understanding of human evolution and medicine, we also provide tables showing the homologies between the pectoral and forelimb muscles of axolotls, of model organisms such as mice, frogs and chicken, and of Homo sapiens. An example illustrating the outcomes of using our methodology and of our observations is that they revealed that, contrary to what is often stated in the literature, A. mexicanum has a muscle coracoradialis that has both a well developed proximal fleshy belly and a distal long and thin tendon, supporting the idea that this muscle very likely corresponds to at least part of the amniote biceps brachii. Our observations also: (i) confirmed that the flexores digitorum minimi, interphalangeus digiti 3, pronator quadratus and palmaris profundus 1 are present as distinct muscles in A. mexicanum, supporting the idea that the latter muscle does not correspond to the pronator accessorius of reptiles; (ii) confirmed that the so-called extensor antebrachii radialis is present as a distinct muscle in this species and, importantly, indicated that this muscle corresponds to the supinator of other tetrapods; (iii) showed that, contrary to some other urodeles, including some other Ambystoma species, there is no distinct muscle epitrochleoanconeus in A. mexicanum and; (iv) showed that the ulnar and radial bundles of the abductor et extensor digiti 1 correspond to the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis longus of other tetrapods, respectively.",2.097,1145

There is a pressing need to identify conserved signalling components among eukaryotes, which will lead to the transfer of knowledge across kingdoms. Two useful properties of a eukaryote model for signalling are (1) reduced signalling complexity, and (2) conservation of signalling components. The alga Ostreococcus tauri is described as the smallest free-living eukaryote. With less than 8,000 genes, it represents a highly constrained genomic palette. RESULTS: Our survey revealed 133 protein kinases and 34 protein phosphatases (1.7% and 0.4% of the proteome). We conducted phosphoproteomic experiments and constructed domain structures and phylogenies for the catalytic protein-kinases. For each of the major kinases families we review the completeness and divergence of O. tauri representatives in comparison to the well-studied kinomes of the laboratory models Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and of Homo sapiens. Many kinase clades in O. tauri were reduced to a single member, in preference to the loss of family diversity, whereas TKL and ABC1 clades were expanded. We also identified kinases that have been lost in A. thaliana but retained in O. tauri. For three, contrasting eukaryotic pathways - TOR, MAPK, and the circadian clock - we established the subset of conserved components and demonstrate conserved sites of substrate phosphorylation and kinase motifs. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that O. tauri satisfies our two central requirements. Several of its kinases are more closely related to H. sapiens orthologs than S. cerevisiae is to H. sapiens. The greatly reduced kinome of O. tauri is therefore a suitable model for signalling in free-living eukaryotes.",3.986,642
24641555,Can we say what diet is best for health?,"['Katz DL', 'Meller S']",Annual review of public health,2014,"Diet is established among the most important influences on health in modern societies. Injudicious diet figures among the leading causes of premature death and chronic disease. Optimal eating is associated with increased life expectancy, dramatic reduction in lifetime risk of all chronic disease, and amelioration of gene expression. In this context, claims abound for the competitive merits of various diets relative to one another. Whereas such claims, particularly when attached to commercial interests, emphasize distinctions, the fundamentals of virtually all eating patterns associated with meaningful evidence of health benefit overlap substantially. There have been no rigorous, long-term studies comparing contenders for best diet laurels using methodology that precludes bias and confounding, and for many reasons such studies are unlikely. In the absence of such direct comparisons, claims for the established superiority of any one specific diet over others are exaggerated. The weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating while allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary approaches. Efforts to improve public health through diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do. Knowledge in this case is not, as of yet, power; would that it were so.",6.469,1001

Here, we deal with the medial pterygoid tubercle (MTP), which is usually present on the internal face of the ascending ramus of Neandertal specimens. Our study stems from the identification of a hypertrophied tubercle in ATD6-96, an Early Pleistocene mandible recovered from the TD6 level of the Atapuerca-Gran Dolina site and attributed to Homo antecessor. Our review of the literature and study of numerous original fossil specimens and high quality replicas confirm that the MTP occurs at a high frequency in Neandertals (ca. 89%) and is also present in over half (ca. 55%) of the Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos (SH) hominins. In contrast, it is generally absent or minimally developed in other extinct hominins, but can be found in variable frequencies (<ca. 25%) in Pleistocene and recent H. sapiens samples. The presence of this feature in ATD6-96 joins other traits shared by H. antecessor, the SH hominins and Neandertals. Since the TD6 hominins have been attributed either to MIS 21 or to MIS 25, it seems that a suite of assumed derived Neandertal features appeared in the Early Pleistocene, and they should be interpreted as synapomorphies shared among different taxa. We suggest that H. antecessor, the SH hominins and Neandertals shared a common ancestor in which these features appeared during the Early Pleistocene. The presence of the MTP in taxa other than H. neanderthalensis precludes this feature from being a Neandertal autapomorphy.",2.379,1361

The presumed functional sensibility of trabecular bone can offer a way of decoding the activities to which the forelimbs of fossil primates were subjected. We examine the proximal humeral trabecular architecture in a relatively closely related group of similarly sized hominids (Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens), in order to evaluate the effect of diverging habitual motion behaviors of the shoulder complex in a coherent phylogenetic group. In order to characterize and compare the humeral trabecular architectures of the three species, we imaged a large sample by high-resolution computed tomography (HrCT) and quantified their trabecular architectures by standard bone 3D morphometric parameters. Univariate statistical analysis was performed, showing significant differences among the species. However, univariate statistics could not highlight the structural particularity in the cancellous bone of each species. A principal component analysis also showed clear separation of the three taxa and enabled a structural characterization of the humeral trabecular bone of each species. We conclude that the differences in the architectural setup of the three hominids likely reflect multiple differences in their habitual activity patterns of their shoulder joint, although individual structural features are difficult to relate to specific loading conditions.",3.733,1031

Trm5 is specific to eukaryotes and archaea, and it is unrelated in evolution from the bacterial counterpart TrmD, which is a leading anti-bacterial target. The successful targeting of TrmD requires detailed information on Trm5 to avoid cross-species inhibition. However, most information on Trm5 is derived from studies of the archaeal enzyme Methanococcus jannaschii (MjTrm5), whereas little information is available for eukaryotic enzymes. Here we use human Trm5 (Homo sapiens; HsTrm5) as an example of eukaryotic enzymes and demonstrate that it has retained key features of catalytic properties of the archaeal MjTrm5, including the involvement of a general base to mediate one proton transfer. We also address the protease sensitivity of the human enzyme upon expression in bacteria. Using the tRNA-bound crystal structure of the archaeal enzyme as a model, we have identified a single substitution in the human enzyme that improves resistance to proteolysis. These results establish conservation in both the catalytic mechanism and overall structure of Trm5 between evolutionarily distant eukaryotic and archaeal species and validate the crystal structure of the archaeal enzyme as a useful model for studies of the human enzyme.",0,1071

The thermodynamic relationship is examined between amino acid sequences and the conformational ensembles for a database of 159 Homo sapiens protein structures ranging from 50 to 250 amino acids. Using hierarchical clustering, it is shown through fold-recognition experiments that (1) eight thermodynamic environmental descriptors sufficiently accounts for the energetic variation within the native state ensembles of the H. sapiens structural database, (2) an amino acid library of only six residue types is sufficient to encode >90% of the thermodynamic information required for fold specificity in the entire database, and (3) structural resolution of the statistically derived environments reveals sequential cooperative segments throughout the protein, which are independent of secondary structure.

Here I test two proposed autapomorphic traits of H. erectus, namely the increased thickness of the upper cranial vault and parasagittal keeling. The definition of these two anatomical features and their expression and variation among hominids are discussed. The results of this study indicate that the upper vault in Asian H. erectus is not absolutely thicker compared with fossil anatomically modern Homo sapiens, whereas Broken Hill and Petralona have values above the range of variation of H. erectus. Moreover, this anatomical region in Asian H. erectus is not significantly thicker compared with Pan paniscus. In addition, these results demonstrate that cranial vault thickness should not be used to make hypotheses regarding sexual attribution of fossil hominin specimens. I also show that the relation between relief on the external surface of the upper vault, parasagittal keeling and bregmatic eminence, and bone thickness is complex. In this context, the autapomorphic status of the two analysed traits in H. erectus may be rejected. Nevertheless, different patterns in the distribution of bone thickness on the upper vault were identified. Some individual variations are visible, but specificities are observable in samples of different species. The pattern of bone thickness distribution observed in Asian H. erectus, P. paniscus, possibly australopiths, and early Homo or Homo ergaster/erectus appears to be shared by these different species and would be a plesiomorphic trait among hominids. In contrast, two apomorphic states for this feature were identified for Neandertals and H. sapiens.",3.733,208

Interestingly, grasses and homeotherm vertebrates exhibit a unique bimodal distribution. High GC(3) was previously found to be associated with variable expression, higher frequency of upstream TATA boxes, and an increase of GC(3) from 5' to 3'. Moreover, GC(3)-rich genes are predominant in certain gene classes and are enriched in CpG dinucleotides that are potential targets for methylation. Based on the GC(3) bimodal distribution we hypothesize that GC(3) has a regulatory role involving methylation and gene expression. To test that hypothesis, we selected diverse taxa (rice, thale cress, bee, and human) that varied in the modality of their GC(3) distribution and tested the association between GC(3), DNA methylation, and gene expression. We examine the relationship between cytosine methylation levels and GC(3), gene expression, genome signature, gene length, and other gene compositional features. We find a strong negative correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = -0.67, P value < 0.0001) between GC(3) and genic CpG methylation. The comparison between 5'-3' gradients of CG(3)-skew and genic methylation for the taxa in the study suggests interplay between gene-body methylation and transcription-coupled cytosine deamination effect. Compositional features are correlated with methylation levels of genes in rice, thale cress, human, bee, and fruit fly (which acts as an unmethylated control). These patterns allow us to generate evolutionary hypotheses about the relationships between GC(3) and methylation and how these affect expression patterns. Specifically, we propose that the opposite effects of methylation and compositional gradients along coding regions of GC(3)-poor and GC(3)-rich genes are the products of several competing processes.",4.229,995

The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol.

However, little is known about enamel thickness in the earliest members of the genus Homo, and recent studies of later Homo report considerable intra- and inter-specific variation. In order to assess taxonomic, geographic, and temporal trends in enamel thickness, we applied micro-computed tomographic imaging to 150 fossil Homo teeth spanning two million years. Early Homo postcanine teeth from Africa and Asia show highly variable average and relative enamel thickness (AET and RET) values. Three molars from South Africa exceed Homo AET and RET ranges, resembling the hyper thick Paranthropus condition. Most later Homo groups (archaic European and north African Homo, and fossil and recent Homo sapiens) possess absolutely and relatively thick enamel across the entire dentition. In contrast, Neanderthals show relatively thin enamel in their incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, although incisor AET values are similar to H. sapiens. Comparisons of recent and fossil H. sapiens reveal that dental size reduction has led to a disproportionate decrease in coronal dentine compared with enamel (although both are reduced), leading to relatively thicker enamel in recent humans. General characterizations of hominins as having 'thick enamel' thus oversimplify a surprisingly variable craniodental trait with limited taxonomic utility within a genus. Moreover, estimates of dental attrition rates employed in paleodemographic reconstruction may be biased when this variation is not considered. Additional research is necessary to reconstruct hominin dietary ecology since thick enamel is not a prerequisite for hard-object feeding, and it is present in most later Homo species despite advances in technology and food processing.",3.733,223

The first hypothesis is that the correlation between basicranial breadth and ambient temperature is stronger than the correlation between temperature and other neurocranial variables, such as maximum cranial breadth, maximum neurocranial length, and the endocranial volume. The second hypothesis is that the correlation between the breadth of the cranial base and the ambient temperature is significant even when other neurocranial features used in this study (including the size of the neurocranium) are constant. For the sake of this research, the necessary neurocranial variables for fourteen human populations living in diverse environments were obtained from Howells' data (except for endocranial volume which was obtained by means of estimation). The ambient temperature (more precisely, the mean yearly temperature) of the environments inhabited by these populations was used as a major climatic factor. Data were analysed using Pearson correlation coefficients, linear regression and partial correlation analyses. The results supported the two hypotheses, thus suggesting that ambient temperature may contribute to the observed differences in the breadth of the cranial base in the studied modern humans.",0,162

The predictive power of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) obtained from loggers attached to different parts of the body was compared to that of heart rate (fH).

For locomotion on the flat, ODBA was still a good predictor when subject identity was replaced by subject mass and height (morphometrics typically obtainable from animals in the field; R2=0.92 and 0.89) and a slightly better overall predictor than fH (R2=0.92 and 0.85). For gradient walking, ODBA predicted VO2 more accurately than before (R2=0.83) and considerably better than did fH (R2=0.77). ODBA and fH combined were the most powerful predictor of VO2 and speed during locomotion.

It is important to evaluate scientifically if features related to CVT bring new information concerning the possible pathological status of LB1, and if it helps to recognize affinities with any hominin species and particularly if the specimen could belong to the species Homo sapiens. Medical examination of the skull based on a micro-CT examination clearly brings to light the presence of a sincipital T (a non-metrical variant of normal anatomy), a scar from an old frontal trauma without any evident functional consequence, and a severe bilateral hyperostosis frontalis interna that may have modified the anterior morphology of the endocranium of LB1. We also show that LB1 displays characteristics, related to the distribution of bone thickness and arrangements of cranial structures, that are plesiomorphic traits for hominins, at least for Homo erectus s.l. relative to Homo neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. All the microcephalic skulls analyzed here share the derived condition of anatomically modern H. sapiens. Cranial vault thickness does not help to clarify the definition of the species H. floresiensis but it also does not support an attribution of LB1 to H. sapiens.

Experiment 1 eliminated the possibility that chimpanzees' previous poor performance was due to the hiding direction of the displacement device. As in Call (2001), subjects failed double nonadjacent displacements, showing a tendency to select adjacent boxes. In Experiments 2 and 3, chimpanzees and 24-month-old children were tested on a new adaptation of the task in which four hiding boxes were presented in a diamond-shaped array on a vertical plane. Both species performed above chance on double invisible displacements using this format, suggesting that previous poor performance was due to a response bias or inhibition problem rather than a fundamental limitation in representational capacity.",1.52,382

Particularly, the structure of protein-protein interaction networks is related to important biological functions. In this work, we investigated how such a resilience is determined by the large scale features of the respective networks. Four species are taken into account, namely yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, worm Caenorhabditis elegans, fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. We adopted two entropy-related measurements (degree entropy and dynamic entropy) in order to quantify the overall degree of robustness of these networks. We verified that while they exhibit similar structural variations under random node removal, they differ significantly when subjected to intentional attacks (hub removal). As a matter of fact, more complex species tended to exhibit more robust networks. More specifically, we quantified how six important measurements of the networks topology (namely clustering coefficient, average degree of neighbors, average shortest path length, diameter, assortativity coefficient, and slope of the power law degree distribution) correlated with the two entropy measurements. Our results revealed that the fraction of hubs and the average neighbor degree contribute significantly for the resilience of networks. In addition, the topological analysis of the removed hubs indicated that the presence of alternative paths between the proteins connected to hubs tend to reinforce resilience. The performed analysis helps to understand how resilience is underlain in networks and can be applied to the development of protein network models.",3.21,1531

The putative GPCRs were distributed over 13 classes, and significantly, three of those represented novel classes of GPCR-like proteins in fungi. The three novel GPCRs had high levels of identity to their counterparts in higher eukaryotes, including Homo sapiens. The numbers of GPCR-like proteins in the two Verticillium spp. were similar to those seen in other filamentous fungi, such as Magnaporthe grisea, Neurospora crassa and Fusarium graminearum. Additionally, the carbon/amino acid receptors were divided into three different subclasses, indicating that differences among the GPCRs existed not only among different classes but also within classes. In conclusion, the identification and classification of GPCRs and their homology to some well-studied fungi will be an important starting point for future research in Verticillium spp.",2.342,1830

Analysis of other M1 features such as the total crown base area, cusp proportions, cusp angles and occlusal polygon have confirmed the differences between both lineages, becoming a useful tool for the taxonomic assignment of isolated teeth from Late Pleistocene sites. However, until now the pattern of expression of these variables has not been known for the SH sample. This fossil sample, the largest collection from the European Middle Pleistocene, is generally interpreted as being from the direct ancestors of Neanderthals, and thus is a reference sample for assessing the origin of the Neanderthal morphologies. Surprisingly, our study reveals that SH M(1) s present a unique mosaic of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens features. Regarding the cusp angles and the relative occlusal polygon area, SH matches the H. neanderthalensis pattern. However, regarding the total crown base area and relative cusps size, SH M(1) s are similar to H. sapiens, with a small crown area, a strong hypocone reduction and a protocone enlargement, although the protocone expansion in SH is significantly larger than in any other group studied. The SH dental sample calls into question the uniqueness of some so-called modern traits.

Membrane proteins and glycophorins analysis by SDS-PAGE as visualized by coomassie brilliant blue and periodic acid-schiff stains, respectively, and agglutination behaviour revealed marked differences: 1) there were prominent dissimilarities in the number and molecular weights of glycophorins in human, goat and buffalo erythrocyte membranes; 2) proteinase action(s) on human and buffalo erythrocyte surface membrane proteins and glycophorins showed similarity but was found different in goat; 3) significant differences in erythrocyte agglutinability with concanavalin A can be attributed to differences in membrane composition and alterations in the surface proteins after enzyme treatment; 4) a direct correlation was found between degradation of glycophorins and concanavalin A agglutinability; 5) action of neuraminidase specifically indicated the negative role of cell surface sialic acids in determining concanavalin A agglutinability of goat and buffalo erythrocytes, similar to human.

23175715,Slow DNA loss in the gigantic genomes of salamanders.,"['Sun C', 'Lopez Arriaza JR', 'Mueller RL']",Genome biology and evolution,2012,"Evolutionary changes in genome size result from the combined effects of mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Insertion and deletion mutations (indels) directly impact genome size by adding or removing sequences. Most species lose more DNA through small indels (i.e., ~1-30 bp) than they gain, which can result in genome reduction over time. Because this rate of DNA loss varies across species, small indel dynamics have been suggested to contribute to genome size evolution. Species with extremely large genomes provide interesting test cases for exploring the link between small indels and genome size; however, most large genomes remain relatively unexplored. Here, we examine rates of DNA loss in the tetrapods with the largest genomes-the salamanders. We used low-coverage genomic shotgun sequence data from four salamander species to examine patterns of insertion, deletion, and substitution in neutrally evolving non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon sequences. For comparison, we estimated genome-wide DNA loss rates in non-LTR retrotransposon sequences from five other vertebrate genomes: Anolis carolinensis, Danio rerio, Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, and Xenopus tropicalis. Our results show that salamanders have significantly lower rates of DNA loss than do other vertebrates. More specifically, salamanders experience lower numbers of deletions relative to insertions, and both deletions and insertions are skewed toward smaller sizes. On the basis of these patterns, we conclude that slow DNA loss contributes to genomic gigantism in salamanders. We also identify candidate molecular mechanisms underlying these differences and suggest that natural variation in indel dynamics provides a unique opportunity to study the basis of genome stability.",4.229,1386

Here, we assess the morphological features of the virtual endocast of the Cioclovina Upper Paleolithic calvarium, one of the earliest reliably dated European modern human fossils. Our study was conducted on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the original specimen. The endocranial profile was approximated via a semiautomatic segmentation of the CT data. Virtual reconstructions of the endocast were used for assessing the morphological features of the endocranium and for the estimation of the endocranial volume. Cioclovina exhibits a clockwise torque with a small anterior extension of the left frontal lobe over the right one and a protrusion of the right occipital lobe over the left, most likely due to the superior sagittal sinus coursing over the occipital pole. There is an obvious right predominance of the posterior drainage system. Interestingly, the area of the frontal sinus is occupied by dense bony tissue with small air cells corresponding probably to a natural bony loss in the diploe and to vascular spaces. An estimated endocranial volume of 1498.53 cc was calculated. The convolutional details of the third inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's caps) are indistinguishable from those found in modern Homo sapiens, and the left occipital lobe appears wider than the right, a possible correlate of right-handedness. Our metric analysis of endocranial measurements also aligns Cioclovina with modern humans.",1.542,1484
24268038,MultiFacTV: module detection from higher-order time series biological data.,[],BMC genomics,2013,"BACKGROUND: Identifying modules from time series biological data helps us understand biological functionalities of a group of proteins/genes interacting together and how responses of these proteins/genes dynamically change with respect to time. With rapid acquisition of time series biological data from different laboratories or databases, new challenges are posed for the identification task and powerful methods which are able to detect modules with integrative analysis are urgently called for. To accomplish such integrative analysis, we assemble multiple time series biological data into a higher-order form, e.g., a gene x condition x time tensor. It is interesting and useful to develop methods to identify modules from this tensor. RESULTS: In this paper, we present MultiFacTV, a new method to find modules from higher-order time series biological data. This method employs a tensor factorization objective function where a time-related total variation regularization term is incorporated. According to factorization results, MultiFacTV extracts modules that are composed of some genes, conditions and time-points. We have performed MultiFacTV on synthetic datasets and the results have shown that MultiFacTV outperforms existing methods EDISA and Metafac. Moreover, we have applied MultiFacTV to Arabidopsis thaliana root(shoot) tissue dataset represented as a gene x condition x time tensor of size 2395 x 9 x 6(3454 x 8 x 6), to Yeast dataset and Homo sapiens dataset represented as tensors of sizes 4425 x 6 x 6 and 2920 x 14 x 9 respectively. The results have shown that MultiFacTV indeed identifies some interesting modules in these datasets, which have been validated and explained by Gene Ontology analysis with DAVID or other analysis. CONCLUSION: Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real datasets show that the proposed MultiFacTV is effective in identifying modules for higher-order time series biological data. It provides, compared to traditional non-integrative analysis methods, a more comprehensive and better view on biological process since modules composed of more than two types of biological variables could be identified and analyzed.",3.986,1197
20868694,A simple definition of structural regions in proteins and its use in analyzing interface evolution.,['Levy ED'],Journal of molecular biology,2010,"Analysis of proteins commonly requires the partition of their structure into regions such as the surface, interior, or interface. Despite the frequent use of such categorization, no consensus definition seems to exist. This study thus aims at providing a definition that is general, is simple to implement, and yields new biological insights. This analysis relies on 397, 196, and 701 protein structures from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, respectively, and the conclusions are consistent across all three species. A threshold of 25% relative accessible surface area best segregates amino acids at the interior and at the surface. This value is further used to extend the core-rim model of protein-protein interfaces and to introduce a third region called support. Interface core, rim, and support regions contain similar numbers of residues on average, but core residues contribute over two-thirds of the contact surface. The amino acid composition of each region remains similar across different organisms and interface types. The interface core composition is intermediate between the surface and the interior, but the compositions of the support and the rim are virtually identical with those of the interior and the surface, respectively.

Fingertips of the first, second and fourth digits were collected from both hands of specimens, dissected and histologically stained using hematoxylin and eosin. The density (MCs per 1 mm(2) ) and the size (cross-sectional diameter of MCs) were quantified. Overall, there were no differences in the densities of MCs or their size among the digits or between the hands for any species examined. However, MCs varied across species. We found a trend for higher densities of MCs in macaques and humans compared with chimpanzees and bonobos; moreover, apes had larger MCs than monkeys. We further examined whether the density or size of MCs varied as a function of body mass, measures of dexterity and dietary frugivory. Among these variables, only body size accounted for a significant amount of variation in the size of MCs.",2.097,738

METHODS: We have performed a comprehensive and integrated characterisation of genome-wide expression related to KRAS mutations and copy-number alterations in primary- and metastatic endometrial carcinoma lesions in relation to clinical and histopathological data. A primary investigation set and clinical validation set was applied, consisting of 414 primary tumours and 61 metastatic lesions totally. RESULTS: Amplification and gain of KRAS present in 3% of the primary lesions and 18% of metastatic lesions correlated significantly with poor outcome, high International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stage, non-endometrioid subtype, high grade, aneuploidy, receptor loss and high KRAS mRNA levels, also found to be associated with aggressive phenotype. In contrast, KRAS mutations were present in 14.7% of primary lesions with no increase in metastatic lesions, and did not influence outcome, but was significantly associated with endometrioid subtype, low grade and obesity.

Radiometric dates and the archaeological context (Acheulo-Yabrudian) bracket the associated cave layers to between 200 and 500 ka (thousands of years ago), making it one of the earliest cranial fossils discovered in the Near East thus far. Its geographic position, at the corridor between Africa and Eurasia, in combination with its probable Middle Pleistocene date make it a crucial specimen for interpreting later human evolution. Since its discovery, qualitative descriptive and traditional morphometric methods have variously suggested affinities to Homo erectus (Zhoukoudian), Homo neanderthalensis (Tabun), and early Homo sapiens (Skhul and Qafzeh). To better determine the taxonomic affinities of the Zuttiyeh fossil, this study uses 3D semilandmark geometric morphometric techniques and multivariate statistical analyses to quantify the frontal and zygomatic region and compare it with other Middle to Late Pleistocene African and Eurasian hominins. Our results show that the frontal and zygomatic morphology of Zuttiyeh is most similar to Shanidar 5, a Near East Neanderthal, Arago 21, a European Middle Pleistocene hominin, and Skhul 5, an early H. sapiens. The shape differences between archaic hominins (i.e., Homo heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis) in this anatomical region are very subtle. We conclude that Zuttiyeh exhibits a generalized frontal and zygomatic morphology, possibly indicative of the population that gave rise to modern humans and Neanderthals. However, given that it most likely postdates the split between these two lineages, Zuttiyeh might also be an early representative of the Neanderthal lineage.

We selected optimal primers from fifty random nucleotide sequences of Homo sapiens at NCBI. The results indicate that the SantaLucia's formula is better coupled with the method to get higher optimal primer frequency and shorter CPU-time than the Wallace's formula and the Bolton and McCarthy's formula.

The nucleotide replacement counts obtained from the human/chimpanzee/gorilla/orangutan sequence alignments representing the replacements due to the evolutionary species divergence and the results of 1000 genomes project that provide us with the differences due to the intraspecies diversification were analyzed to estimate the ratio of CpG versus non-CpG transversion probabilities. The trinucleotide replacement counts were extracted from the regions that are free of functional constraints. The CpG transversion probabilities based upon the genomic comparisons were found to exceed more than twice the non-CpG transversions. The diversity data emerging from 14 population groups were partitioned in five classes as a function of the parameter quantifying the spread of the polymorphic allele among the group of individuals. The results based upon the human polymorphism exhibit a trend where CpG over non-CpG transversion probability ratio is less and less exceeding unity as the values of the derived allele frequency (DAF) of snps are diminishing.

11359350,The extinction program for Homo sapiens and cloning humans: trinucleotide expansion as a one-way track to extinction.,['Kubota S'],Medical hypotheses,2001,"It has been uncovered that expansion of trinucleotide repeats in the human genome are causing a variety of genetic diseases. They are also identified in other loci that are not clearly related to particular diseases, which indicates such repeat expansion is one of the general forms of evolution occurring throughout the human genome. Trinucleotide repeat expansion has been shown to occur during meiosis, and is generally irreversible. In consequence, every human chromosome suffers from the burden of accumulating trinucleotide repeats along with the passage of generation, which eventually ends up in a deficiency of replication. Thus, all the human chromosomes are predicted to be 'mortal', so far as they replicate through meiosis. Naturally, the mortality of human chromosomes leads to the mortality of Homo sapiens as a species on earth. Although it is quite controversial, a radical breakthrough for humans to survive might be found through cloning reproduction without meiosis.",1.074,324
22066262,[Where intestinal epithelial stem cells are localized? About molecular markers].,[],Biomeditsinskaia khimiia,2011,"Using stem cells as an example the review considers a new history and methodology of search for stem cells (SC), found in tissues of adult Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster organisms. These studies of SC resulted in several original hypotheses explaining their unusual features. Impressive progress recently achieved in this direction (2008-2010) is associated with employment of new methods of somatic recombination for long-term registration of various strains of differentiated cells, early and distant SC progeny. 1) Although anatomic localization of intestinal epithelium cells lacking marked morphological and biochemical differentiation markers (the lower third of intestinal and colon crypts) is known for about 40 years results of their experimental identification, isolation and detection of their functional characteristics still represent the subject for discussions. Particularly, it remains unclear, which SC are involved in crypt regeneration: the same as those involved into homeostatic renewal or their various subpopulations or early SC progenies acquired stem features by reprogramming? 2) In addition, most detected biochemical markers of potential SC are common for SC from other tissues of embryonic and mature organisms so it is possible to apply method developed for intestinal epithelium for their isolation. 3) Data on induction of intestinal epithelium polyps and neoplasias by mutations in genes encoding SC markers and identification of biochemical characteristics of potential SC in these tumors support the hypothesis of stem tumor cell origination from normal SC or their earliest progeny. In general, facts considered in this review may be useful for both development of optimal methods for the use of SC in cell therapy (as the source of humoral factors), regenerative medicine (as the source of differentiated cells for restoration of injured tissue), and also for targeted search of antitumor drugs (SC as the target) and preparations modifying genetic and epigenetic reactions of SC to genotoxic and stress treatments.",0,1490
27510928,Endogenous non-retroviral RNA virus elements evidence a novel type of antiviral immunity.,"['Honda T', 'Tomonaga K']",Mobile genetic elements,2016,"Vertebrate genomes contain many virus-related sequences derived from both retroviruses and non-retroviral RNA and DNA viruses. Such non-retroviral RNA sequences are possibly produced by reverse-transcription and integration of viral mRNAs of ancient RNA viruses using retrotransposon machineries. We refer to this process as transcript reversion. During an ancient bornavirus infection, transcript reversion may have left bornavirus-related sequences, known as endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoproteins (EBLNs), in the genome. We have recently demonstrated that all Homo sapiens EBLNs are expressed in at least one tissue. Because species with EBLNs appear relatively protected against infection by a current bornavirus, Borna disease virus, it is speculated that EBLNs play some roles in antiviral immunity, as seen with some endogenous retroviruses. EBLNs can function as dominant negative forms of viral proteins, small RNAs targeting viral sequences, or DNA or RNA elements modulating the gene expression. Growing evidence reveals that various RNA viruses are reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome of infected cells, suggesting transcript reversion generally occurs during ongoing infection. Considering this, transcript reversion-mediated interference with related viruses may be a novel type of antiviral immunity in vertebrates. Understanding the biological significance of transcript reversion will provide novel insights into host defenses against viral infections.",0,664

Adult mandibles of Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Gorilla gorilla gorilla and from 2 modern human populations (Zulu and Europeans from Spitalfields) were reliably sexed. Thirteen measurements were defined and included mandibular height, length and breadth in representative positions. Univariate statistical techniques and multivariate (principal component analysis and discriminant analysis) statistical techniques were used to investigate interspecific variability and sexual dimorphism in human and great ape mandibles, and intraspecific variability among the modern human mandibles. Analysis of interspecific differences revealed some pairs of variables with a tight linear relationship and others where Homo and the great apes pulled apart from one another due to shape differences. Homo and Pan are least sexually dimorphic in the mandible, Pan less so than Homo sapiens, but both the magnitude of sexual dimorphism and the distribution of sexually dimorphic measurements varied both among and between modern humans and great apes. Intraspecific variation among the 10 populations of modern humans was less than that generally reported in studies of crania (74.3% of mandibles were correctly classified into 1 of 10 populations using discriminant functions based on 13 variables as compared with 93% of crania from 17 populations based on 70 variables in one extensive study of crania). A subrecent European population (Poundbury) emerged as more different from a recent European population (Spitalfields) than other more diverse modern populations were from each other, suggesting considerable morphological plasticity in the mandible through time. This study forms a sound basis on which to explore mandibular variation in Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens and other more ancient fossil hominids.",2.097,1620
17696649,What makes us human (Homo sapiens)? The challenge of cognitive cross-species comparison.,['Boesch C'],"Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983)",2007,"Two major theoretical approaches have dominated the quest for uniquely human cognitive abilities: a developmentalist approach stressing the importance of environmental and social conditions, and a predominant approach in experimental and comparative psychology, the deterministic approach suggesting the effect of environmental and social conditions to be minimal. As a consequence, most claims of human cognitive uniqueness are based on comparisons of White middle class Westerner humans (Homo sapiens) with captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). However, humans are much more than only White middle class Westerners, and chimpanzees are much more than only captives. A review of some data available on different populations of humans and chimpanzees reveals that only the predictions of the developmentalist approach are supported. In addition, systematic biases are too often introduced in experiment protocols when comparing humans with apes that further cast doubts on cross-species comparisons. The author argues that only with consideration of within-species population differences in the cognitive domains and the use of well-matched cross-species experimental procedures will an objective understanding of the different cognitive abilities between species emerge. This will require a shift in the theoretical approach adopted by many in experimental and comparative psychology.",1.52,338

24498949,Side chain conformational averaging in human dihydrofolate reductase.,"['Tuttle LM', 'Dyson HJ', 'Wright PE']",Biochemistry,2014,"The three-dimensional structures of the dihydrofolate reductase enzymes from Escherichia coli (ecDHFR or ecE) and Homo sapiens (hDHFR or hE) are very similar, despite a rather low level of sequence identity. Whereas the active site loops of ecDHFR undergo major conformational rearrangements during progression through the reaction cycle, hDHFR remains fixed in a closed loop conformation in all of its catalytic intermediates. To elucidate the structural and dynamic differences between the human and E. coli enzymes, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of side chain flexibility and dynamics in complexes of hDHFR that represent intermediates in the major catalytic cycle. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion experiments show that, in marked contrast to the functionally important motions that feature prominently in the catalytic intermediates of ecDHFR, millisecond time scale fluctuations cannot be detected for hDHFR side chains. Ligand flux in hDHFR is thought to be mediated by conformational changes between a hinge-open state when the substrate/product-binding pocket is vacant and a hinge-closed state when this pocket is occupied. Comparison of X-ray structures of hinge-open and hinge-closed states shows that helix alphaF changes position by sliding between the two states. Analysis of chi1 rotamer populations derived from measurements of (3)JCgammaCO and (3)JCgammaN couplings indicates that many of the side chains that contact helix alphaF exhibit rotamer averaging that may facilitate the conformational change. The chi1 rotamer adopted by the Phe31 side chain depends upon whether the active site contains the substrate or product. In the holoenzyme (the binary complex of hDHFR with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), a combination of hinge opening and a change in the Phe31 chi1 rotamer opens the active site to facilitate entry of the substrate. Overall, the data suggest that, unlike ecDHFR, hDHFR requires minimal backbone conformational rearrangement as it proceeds through its enzymatic cycle, but that ligand flux is brokered by more subtle conformational changes that depend on the side chain motions of critical residues.",3.015,990

In order to assess the transcription inventory of sponges, we sequenced expressed sequence tag libraries of two demosponge species, Suberites domuncula and Lubomirskia baicalensis, and systematically analyzed the assembled sponge transcripts against their homologs from complete proteomes of six well-characterized metazoans--Nematostella vectensis, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Ciona intestinalis, and Homo sapiens. We show that even the earliest metazoan species already have strikingly complex genomes in terms of gene content and functional repertoire and that the rich gene repertoire existed even before the emergence of true tissues, therefore further emphasizing the importance of gene loss and spatio-temporal changes in regulation of gene expression in shaping the metazoan genomes. Our findings further indicate that sponge and human genes generally show similarity levels higher than expected from their respective positions in metazoan phylogeny, providing direct evidence for slow rate of evolution in both",9.105,1646

Importantly, this trend is most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein evolution is most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral primates to humans. Thus, the remarkable phenotypic evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate, i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those linked to nervous system development. In addition to uncovering broad evolutionary trends, our study also identified many candidate genes--most of which are implicated in regulating brain size and behavior--that might have played important roles in the evolution of the human brain.",32.242,464

Seven derived features of LB1's cerebral cortex are detailed: a caudally-positioned occipital lobe, lack of a rostrally-located lunate sulcus, a caudally-expanded temporal lobe, advanced morphology of the lateral prefrontal cortex, shape of the rostral prefrontal cortex, enlarged gyri in the frontopolar region, and an expanded orbitofrontal cortex. These features indicate that LB1's brain was globally reorganized despite its ape-sized cranial capacity (417cm(3)). Neurological reorganization may thus form the basis for the cognitive abilities attributed to H. floresiensis. Because of its tiny cranial capacity, some workers think that LB1 represents a Homo sapiens individual that was afflicted with microcephaly, or some other pathology, rather than a new species of hominin. We respond to concerns about our earlier study of microcephalics compared with normal individuals, and reaffirm that LB1 did not suffer from this pathology. The intense controversy about LB1 reflects an older continuing dispute about the relative evolutionary importance of brain size versus neurological reorganization.

1776654,Modern human origins in Australasia: replacement or evolution?,['Kramer A'],American journal of physical anthropology,1991,"The controversies surrounding the origins of modern humans have spawned two competing hypotheses, namely Replacement and Multiregional Evolution. The first suggests that modern Homo sapiens evolved first in Africa, as late as 140 ka, and subsequently inhabited the balance of the Old World. Conversely, the second hypothesis posits that modern humans evolved principally from local populations of archaic hominids indigenous to the major regions of the Old World. The hominid mandibular remains (ca. 1 Ma) from Sangiran, central Java, Indonesia, were studied in order to test these hypotheses. Non-metric comparisons were performed between these fossils and aboriginal H. sapiens from Africa and Australia. The Replacement model would be supported by a unique Afro-Australian grouping while Multiregional Evolution would be suggested by a Sangiran-Australasian group which would exclude the modern Africans. These data support the Multiregional Evolution hypothesis in that a plurality (eight) of the seventeen non-metric features link Sangiran to modern Australians, while only three exclusively group the humans from Africa and Australia. These results are suggestive of morphological continuity, which implies the presence of a genetic continuum in Australasia dating back at least one million years.",2.379,1886

For example, they grasp objects with uncomfortable grasps to afford comfortable end positions-the end-state comfort (ESC) effect. When did such sophisticated motor planning abilities emerge in evolution? We addressed this question by asking whether humans' most distant living primate relatives-lemurs-also exhibit the ESC effect. We presented 6 species of lemurs (Lemur catta, Eulemur mongoz, Eulemur coronatus, Eulemur collaris, Hapalemur griseus, and Varecia rubra) with a food extraction task and measured the grasp used-either a canonical thumb-up posture or a noncanonical thumb-down posture. The lemurs adopted the thumb-down posture when that hand position afforded a thumb-up posture following object transport, thereby exhibiting the ESC effect. We conclude that the planning abilities underlying the ESC effect evolved at least 65 million years ago, or 25 million years earlier than previously supposed based on an earlier demonstration of the ESC effect in cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus; Weiss, Wark, & Rosenbaum, 2007).

We investigated the diversity of full-length mitochondrial DNA genomes of the Zapotec population, residing in the Mesoamerican region, and reconstructed their demographic history using Bayesian Skyline Plots. We estimated the initial date of gene flow into the New World by Zapotec ancestors at around 17 000-19 000 years ago,which is highly concordant with previous studies. We also show a population decline after the initial expansion. This decline started 4000 years ago, long before European contact with Native Americans.

However, unlike chimpanzees, children of all ages used causally irrelevant information in a control test designed to examine the possibility that their apparent auditory inferences were the product of contingency learning (the duplicate cups test). Nevertheless, the children's ability to reason by exclusion was corroborated by their performance on a novel verbal disjunctive syllogism test, and we found preliminary evidence consistent with the suggestion that children used their causal-logical understanding to reason by exclusion in the cups task, but subsequently treated the duplicate cups information as symbolic or communicative, rather than causal.

Investigation of molecular interactions between the proteins of a host and a pathogen helps in identifying the pathogenic proteins. It is necessary to understand the dynamics of a normally behaved host system to evaluate the capacity of its immune system upon pathogen attack. In this study, we have compared the behavior of an unperturbed and pathogen perturbed host system. Moreover, we have developed a formalism under Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) for the optimization of conflicting objective functions. We have constructed an integrated pathway system, which includes Staphylococcal Superantigen (SAg) expression regulatory pathway and TCR signaling pathway of Homo sapiens. We have implemented the method on this pathway system and observed the behavior of host signaling molecules upon pathogen attack. The entire study has been divided into six different cases, based on the perturbed/unperturbed conditions. In other words, we have investigated unperturbed and pathogen perturbed human TCR signaling pathway, with different combinations of optimization of concentrations of regulatory and signaling molecules. One of these cases has aimed at finding out whether minimization of the toxin production in a pathogen leads to the change in the concentration levels of the proteins coded by TCR signaling pathway genes in the infected host. Based on the computed results, we have hypothesized that the balance between TCR signaling inhibitory and stimulatory molecules can keep TCR signaling system into resting/stimulating state, depending upon the perturbation. The proposed integrated host-pathogen interaction pathway model has accurately reflected the experimental evidences, which we have used for validation purpose. The significance of this kind of investigation lies in revealing the susceptible interaction points that can take back the Staphylococcal Enterotoxin (SE)-challenged system within the range of normal behavior.",3.234,101

Furthermore, functional proteomic studies revealed that proteins resembling human peptides have been detected within Ankaferd(R), including ATP synthase, mucin-16 (CD164 sialomucin-like 2 protein), coiled-coil domain containing 141 hypothetical protein LOC283638 isoform 1, hypothetical protein LOC283638 isoform 2, dynactin 5, complex I intermediate-associated protein 30, mitochondrial, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, TP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial actin binding 1 isoform, LIM domain and actin binding 1 isoform a, LIM domain and actin binding 1 isoform b, spectrin alpha non erythrocytic 1, prolactin releasing hormone receptor, utrophin, tet oncogene family member 2 isoform b, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A, NIMA (never in mitosis gene a)-related kinase, ATP-binding cassette protein C12, Homo sapiens malic enzyme 1, mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme 3, ME2 protein, nuclear factor 1 B-type, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 12B, E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2, alpha-1, 2-glucosyltransferase ALG10-A, cofilin, non-muscle isoform, 18 kDa phosphoprotein, p18, actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF), twinfilin-1, ankyrin repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1, usherin precursor, urotensin II receptor, interleukin 4, and midkine. CONCLUSION: Proteomic analysis of Ankaferd(R) represents a true basis for the upcoming Ankaferd(R) studies focusing on its wound healing, hemostatic, anti-infective, antineoplastic, and preservative biological actions.",0.177,1786

RESULTS: We report 19 miRNA precursors in Arabidopsis that can yield multiple distinct miRNA-like RNAs in addition to miRNAs and miRNA*s. These miRNA precursor-derived miRNA-like RNAs are often arranged in phase and form duplexes with an approximately two-nucleotide 3'-end overhang. Their production depends on the same biogenesis pathway as their sibling miRNAs and does not require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases or RNA polymerase IV. These miRNA-like RNAs are methylated, and many of them are associated with Argonaute proteins. Some of the miRNA-like RNAs are differentially expressed in response to bacterial challenges, and some are more abundant than the cognate miRNAs. Computational and expression analyses demonstrate that some of these miRNA-like RNAs are potentially functional and they target protein-coding genes for silencing. The function of some of these miRNA-like RNAs was further supported by their target cleavage products from the published small RNA degradome data. Our systematic examination of public small-RNA deep sequencing data from four additional plant species (Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula and Populus trichocarpa) and four animals (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila) shows that such miRNA-like RNAs exist broadly in eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that multiple miRNAs could derive from miRNA precursors by sequential processing of Dicer or Dicer-like proteins. Our results suggest that the pool of miRNAs is larger than was previously recognized, and miRNA-mediated gene regulation may be broader and more complex than previously thought.",10.81,1861

We cloned the cDNA and determined the genomic  sequence of the ATP5G1 gene from the giant panda (Ailuropoda  melanoleuca) using RT-PCR technology and touchdown-PCR, respectively. The  cloned cDNA fragment contains an open reading frame of 411 bp encoding 136  amino acids; the length of the genomic sequence is of 1838 bp, containing three  exons and two introns. Alignment analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequence  and the deduced protein sequence are highly conserved compared to Homo  sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus,  and Sus scrofa. The homologies for nucleotide sequences of the giant  panda ATP5G1 to those of these species are 93.92, 92.21, 92.46, 93.67, and  92.46%, respectively, and the homologies for amino acid sequences are 90.44,  95.59, 93.38, 94.12, and 91.91%, respectively. Topology prediction showed that  there is one protein kinase C phosphorylation site, one casein kinase II  phosphorylation site, five N-myristoylation sites, and one ATP synthase c  subunit signature in the ATP5G1 protein of the giant panda.

The heme-bound ligand binding domains of E75 and Rev-erbbeta were studied using electronic absorption, MCD, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopies. Both proteins undergo redox-dependent ligand switching and CO- and NO-induced ligand displacement. In the Fe(III) oxidation state, the nuclear receptor hemes are low spin and 6-coordinate with cysteine(thiolate) as one of the two axial heme ligands. The sixth ligand is a neutral donor, presumably histidine. When the heme is reduced to the Fe(II) oxidation state, the cysteine(thiolate) is replaced by a different neutral donor ligand, whose identity is not known. CO binds to the Fe(II) heme in both E75(LBD) and Rev-erbbeta(LBD) opposite a sixth neutral ligand, plausibly the same histidine that served as the sixth ligand in the Fe(III) state. NO binds to the heme of both proteins; however, the NO-heme is 5-coordinate in E75 and 6-coordinate in Rev-erbbeta. These nuclear receptors exhibit coordination characteristics that are similar to other known redox and gas sensors, suggesting that E75 and Rev-erbbeta may function in heme-, redox-, or gas-regulated control of cellular function.",3.015,459

In contrast, great apes wean later, reproduce earlier, and have longer intervals between births. Despite 80 y of speculation, the origins of these developmental patterns in Homo sapiens remain unknown. Because they record daily growth during formation, teeth provide important insights, revealing that australopithecines and early Homo had more rapid ontogenies than recent humans. Dental development in later Homo species has been intensely debated, most notably the issue of whether Neanderthals and H. sapiens differ. Here we apply synchrotron virtual histology to a geographically and temporally diverse sample of Middle Paleolithic juveniles, including Neanderthals, to assess tooth formation and calculate age at death from dental microstructure. We find that most Neanderthal tooth crowns grew more rapidly than modern human teeth, resulting in significantly faster dental maturation. In contrast, Middle Paleolithic H. sapiens juveniles show greater similarity to recent humans. These findings are consistent with recent cranial and molecular evidence for subtle developmental differences between Neanderthals and H. sapiens. When compared with earlier hominin taxa, both Neanderthals and H. sapiens have extended the duration of dental development.

The drugs available for treatment in humans are becoming ineffective mainly due to parasite resistance; therefore, it is extremely important to develop a new chemotherapy against these parasites. A crucial aspect of drug design development is the identification and characterization of novel molecular targets. In this work, through an in silico comparative analysis between the genomes of Leishmania major and Homo sapiens, the enzyme ribose 5-phosphate isomerase (R5PI) was indicated as a promising molecular target. R5PI is an important enzyme that acts in the pentose phosphate pathway and catalyzes the interconversion of d-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and d-ribulose-5-phosphate (5RP). R5PI activity is found in two analogous groups of enzymes called RpiA (found in H. sapiens) and RpiB (found in L. major). Here, we present the first report of the three-dimensional (3D) structures and active sites of RpiB from L. major (LmRpiB) and RpiA from H. sapiens (HsRpiA). Three-dimensional models were constructed by applying a hybrid methodology that combines comparative and ab initio modeling techniques, and the active site was characterized based on docking studies of the substrates R5P (furanose and ring-opened forms) and 5RP. Our comparative analyses show that these proteins are structural analogs and that distinct residues participate in the interconversion of R5P and 5RP. We propose two distinct reaction mechanisms for the reversible isomerization of R5P to 5RP, which is catalyzed by LmRpiB and HsRpiA. We expect that the present results will be important in guiding future molecular modeling studies to develop new drugs that are specially designed to inhibit the parasitic form of the enzyme without significant effects on the human analog.",1.722,13

An in silico comparative analysis of metabolic pathways of the host Homo sapiens (H. sapiens) and the pathogen S. pneumoniae have been performed. Enzymes from the biochemical pathways of S. pneumoniae from the KEGG metabolic pathway database were compared with proteins from the host H. sapiens, by performing a BLASTp search against the non-redundant database restricted to the H. sapiens subset. The e-value threshold cutoff was set to 0.005. Enzymes, which do not show similarity to any of the host proteins, below this threshold, were filtered out as potential drug targets. Five pathways unique to the pathogen S. pneumoniae when compared to the host H. sapiens have been identified. Potential drug targets from these pathways could be useful for the discovery of broad-spectrum drugs. Potential drug targets were also identified from pathways related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, vitamin and cofactor biosynthetic pathways and nucleotide metabolism. Of the 161 distinct targets identified from these pathways, many are in various stages of progress at the Microbial Genome Database. However, 44 of the targets are new and can be considered for rational drug design. The study was successful in listing out potential drug targets from the S. pneumoniae proteome involved in vital aspects of the pathogen's metabolism, persistence, virulence and cell wall biosynthesis.

METHODS: For the genome-wide analysis, we constructed DNA pools from 75 subjects with atopy and asthma, 75 subjects with atopy and without asthma and 75 control subjects without atopy or asthma. In a second stage, the most promising regions surrounding significant markers after correction for false discovery rate were replicated with individual genotyping of samples included in the pools and an additional set of 429 atopic subjects and 222 controls from the same study centres.

The purpose of this study was thus to provide original data to confirm or refute this classical affirmation with the perspective of some original insights into biological significance of the frontal sinuses and the factors influencing their exceptional polymorphism. The material consisted of 143 dry skulls of adult individuals (European Homo sapiens), distributed in two groups: 80 skulls presenting a complete frontal closure with total disappearance of the metopic suture, and 63 skulls presenting a complete persistence of the metopic suture. Each skull was radiographed in oblique projection using the occipitomental view. A simple morphological quantification of the sinus size was defined with four categories: (1) aplasia, (2) hypoplasia, (3) medium size, (4) hyperplasia. Statistically significant difference in frontal sinusal size was found between both groups of skulls. Absent and small sinuses were considerably more frequent in skulls with persistence of the metopic suture (57.9 vs. 11.9%): small frontal sinuses (hypoplasia) were much more frequent (50.8 vs. 9.4%), although the frequency of absence of frontal sinuses (aplasia) was only slightly higher (7.1 vs. 2.5%).",2.379,925

 & molecular biology",2002,"The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of the mammalian central nervous system is almost wholly composed of two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). PUFA are dietarily essential, thus normal infant/neonatal brain, intellectual growth and development cannot be accomplished if they are deficient during pregnancy and lactation. Uniquely in the human species, the fetal brain consumes 70% of the energy delivered to it by mother. DHA and AA are needed to construct placental and fetal tissues for cell membrane growth, structure and function. Contemporary evidence shows that the maternal circulation is depleted of AA and DHA during fetal growth. Sustaining normal adult human brain function also requires LC-PUFA.Homo sapiens is unlikely to have evolved a large, complex, metabolically expensive brain in an environment which did not provide abundant dietary LC-PUFA. Conversion of 18-carbon PUFA from vegetation to AA and DHA is considered quantitatively insufficient due to a combination of high rates of PUFA oxidation for energy, inefficient and rate limited enzymatic conversion and substrate recycling. The littoral marine and lacustrine food chains provide consistently greater amounts of pre-formed LC-PUFA than the terrestrial food chain. Dietary levels of DHA are 2.5-100 fold higher for equivalent weights of marine fish or shellfish vs. lean or fat terrestrial meats. Mammalian brain tissue and bird egg yolks, especially from marine birds, are the richest terrestrial sources of LC-PUFA. However, land animal adipose fats have been linked to vascular disease and mental ill-health, whereas marine lipids have been demonstrated to be protective. At South African Capesites, large shell middens and fish remains are associated with evidence for some of the earliest modern humans. Cape sites dating from 100 to 18 kya cluster within 200 km of the present coast. Evidence of early H. sapiens is also found around the Rift Valley lakes and up the Nile Corridor into the Middle East; in some cases there is an association with the use of littoral resources. Exploitation of river, estuarine, stranded and spawning fish, shellfish and sea bird nestlings and eggs by Homo could have provided essential dietary LC-PUFA for men, women, and children without requiring organized hunting/fishing, or sophisticated social behavior. It is however, predictable from the present evidence that exploitation of this food resource would have provided the advantage in multi-generational brain development which would have made possible the advent of H. sapiens. Restriction to land based foods as postulated by the savannah and other hypotheses would have led to degeneration of the brain and vascular system as happened without exception in all other land based apes and mammals as they evolved larger bodies.",2.055,270

Co-infections of M. tuberculosis with HIV are difficult to treat. To counter these new challenges, it is essential to study the interactions between M. tuberculosis and the host to learn how these bacteria cause disease. RESULTS: We report a systematic flow to predict the host pathogen interactions (HPIs) between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens based on sequence motifs. First, protein sequences were used as initial input for identifying the HPIs by 'interolog' method. HPIs were further filtered by prediction of domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Functional annotations of protein and publicly available experimental results were applied to filter the remaining HPIs. Using such a strategy, 118 pairs of HPIs were identified, which involve 43 proteins from M. tuberculosis and 48 proteins from Homo sapiens. A biological interaction network between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens was then constructed using the predicted inter- and intra-species interactions based on the 118 pairs of HPIs. Finally, a web accessible database named PATH (Protein interactions of M. tuberculosis and Human) was constructed to store these predicted interactions and proteins.

The SLCs are found in at least 46 gene families in the human genome. Here, we performed the first evolutionary analysis of the entire SLC family based on whole genome sequences. We systematically mined and analyzed the genomes of 17 species to identify SLC genes. In all, we identified 4,813 SLC sequences in these genomes, and we delineated the evolutionary history of each of the subgroups. Moreover, we also identified ten new human sequences not previously classified as SLCs, which most likely belong to the SLC family. We found that 43 of the 46 SLC families found in Homo sapiens were also found in Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas 42 of them were also found in insects. Mammals have a higher number of SLC genes in most families, perhaps reflecting important roles for these in central nervous system functions. This study provides a systematic analysis of the evolutionary history of the SLC families in Eukaryotes showing that the SLC superfamily is ancient with multiple branches that were present before early divergence of Bilateria. The results provide foundation for overall classification of SLC genes and are valuable for annotation and prediction of substrates for the many SLCs that have not been tested in experimental transport assays.",9.105,1532
23990819,Should autism be considered a canary bird telling that Homo sapiens may be on its way to extinction?,['Christophersen OA'],Microbial ecology in health and disease,2012,"There has been a dramatic enhancement of the reported incidence of autism in different parts of the world over the last 30 years. This can apparently not be explained only as a result of improved diagnosis and reporting, but may also reflect a real change. The causes of this change are unknown, but if we shall follow T.C. Chamberlin's principle of multiple working hypotheses, we need to take into consideration the possibility that it partly may reflect an enhancement of the average frequency of responsible alleles in large populations. If this hypothesis is correct, it means that the average germline mutation rate must now be much higher in the populations concerned, compared with the natural mutation rate in hominid ancestors before the agricultural and industrial revolutions. This is compatible with the high prevalence of impaired human semen quality in several countries and also with what is known about high levels of total exposure to several different unnatural chemical mutagens, plus some natural ones at unnaturally high levels. Moreover, dietary deficiency conditions that may lead to enhancement of mutation rates are also very widespread, affecting billions of people. However, the natural mutation rate in hominids has been found to be so high that there is apparently no tolerance for further enhancement of the germline mutation rate before the Eigen error threshold will be exceeded and our species will go extinct because of mutational meltdown. This threat, if real, should be considered far more serious than any disease causing the death only of individual patients. It should therefore be considered the first and highest priority of the best biomedical scientists in the world, of research-funding agencies and of all medical doctors to try to stop the express train carrying all humankind as passengers on board before it arrives at the end station of our civilization.",2.973,157

The morphology and diagnostic characteristics are typical of other intestinal species of Cryptosporidium, albeit with slightly larger oocysts (5.55-6.40x5.02-5.92 mum; mean 5.98x5.38 mum; length:width=1.1; n=50). Natural hosts appear to be European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and humans (Homo sapiens). Experimental infections have been established in weanling rabbits (O. cuniculus), immunosuppressed Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) and immunosuppressed adult Porton strain mice (Mus musculus), but not in neonatal mice. Patterns of infection measured by oocyst shedding are significantly different compared with C. hominis, particularly in rabbits. Histological examination reveals endogenous stages in the brush border of the epithelium of the small intestinal villi, but clinical signs are absent. Inoculation of human HCT-8 cells results in discrete clusters of endogenous stages. A close relationship with C. hominis is inferred from molecular analyses at the ssrRNA, 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), actin, Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP), 60 kDa glycoprotein (GP60) genes and a region encoding a product of unknown function (LIB13). Sequences contained limited, consistent polymorphisms at the ssrRNA, HSP70 and actin genes, were identical at the COWP and LIB13 genes and demonstrated two unique families at the GP60 gene. Although genetically closely related, there are significant biological differences between C. cuniculus and C. hominis that support these protozoa being separate species. This is based on the current understanding of these organisms and relies on the assumption that mating between these species would not normally occur. If this is subsequently demonstrated their categorisation may need to be re-addressed.",3.872,1608

According to the nonspecificity hypothesis, there are no distinct large classes of genes affecting one group of attributes exclusively; thus infracranial nonmetric traits should compare with other osteologic data sets in addressing questions of population relationships. By using the mean measure of divergence, infracranial nonmetric traits are shown to be useful in separating populations, particularly when using female and pooled-sex samples. The two Australian female samples (New South Wales coastal Australian and South Australian Aboriginals) are shown to be closer than any other two samples. The picture of intrapopulation and interpopulation variation in infracranial nonmetric traits is extended and clarified. Distance studies with infracranial nonmetric traits are possible but more illuminating if the sexes are first separated. Infracranial nonmetric variation does extend the knowledge of human population studies in yielding biologically meaningful results relating to development and ontogeny.",2.379,496

Movement segmentation had differential effects on absolute heading error for humans and rats when only comparing performance on specific tasks; however, movement segmentation had similar effects for both species when performance was examined across all tasks. In general, magnitude of movement segmentation was associated with absolute heading error in both humans and rats. In contrast, both species modified homeward segment kinematics based on the distance to the start location in all tasks, consistent with the use of self-movement cues to estimate distance.

The Burmese subspecies (M. f. aurea) inhabits coastal areas in southwestern Thailand and Myanmar, and some of their populations have adapted lithic customs for processing encased foods in intertidal habitats. We investigated the diet of such macaques in Laemson National Park, Thailand, and identified the variety of foods they processed with stones. We conducted 36 shore surveys to study tool sites following feeding activity, during which we counted the minimum number of individual (MNI) food items found at each site. We identified 47 food species (43 animals and four plants), from 37 genera. We counted 1,991 food items during surveys. Nearly all were mollusks (n = 1,924), with the small remainder primarily consisting of crustaceans and nuts. The two most common foods, rock oysters (Saccostrea cucullata; n = 1,062) and nerite snails (Nerita spp.; n = 538), composed 80.2% of our sample. Four prey species comprised 83.2% of the sample (MNI = 1,656), S. cucullata (n = 1,062), Nerita chamaeleon (n = 419), Thais bitubercularis (n = 95), and Monodonta labio (n = 80). Macaques selected a wide variety of foods. However, they heavily concentrated on those that were abundant, easy to access, and sufficiently sized. The Burmese long-tailed macaque stone-processed diet, which focuses on intertidal marine prey, differs from Sapajus and Pan, who use stones primarily for encased nuts and fruits. In terms of diversity of foods exploited, coastal stone-based predation by macaques resembles the diet of coastal-foraging humans (Homo sapiens sapiens).",2.379,1165

Although enolase multifunctionality has been described for several organisms, the conservation of enolase alternative functions through different phyla has not been explored with more details. A useful strategy to investigate moonlighting functions is the use of systems biology tools, which allow the prediction of protein functions/interactions by graph design and analysis. In this work, available information from protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases were used to design enolase PPI networks for four eukaryotic organisms, namely Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, covering a wide spectrum of this domain of life. PPI networks with number of nodes ranging from 140 to 411 and up to 15,855 connections were generated, and modularity and centrality analyses, and functional enrichment were performed for all of them. The performed analyses showed that enolase is a central node within the networks, and that, in addition to its canonical interactions with proteins related to glycolysis and energetic metabolism, it is also part of protein clusters related to different biological processes, like transcription, development, and apoptosis, among others. Some of these non-glycolytic clusters, are partially conserved between networks, in terms of overall sharing of orthologs, overall cluster structure, and/or at the levels of key regulatory proteins within clusters. Overall, our results provided evidences of enolase multifunctionality and evolutionary conservation of enolase PPIs at all these levels.",1.117,696

Here, we report a protein transport mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, named maigo5 (mag5), which abnormally accumulates precursor forms of storage proteins in seeds. mag5-1 has a deletion in the putative ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens Sec16, which encodes a critical component of ER exit sites (ERESs). mag mutants developed abnormal structures (MAG bodies) within the ER and exhibited compromised ER export. A functional MAG5/SEC16A-green fluorescent protein fusion localized at Golgi-associated cup-shaped ERESs and cycled on and off these sites at a slower rate than the COPII coat. MAG5/SEC16A interacted with SEC13 and SEC31; however, in the absence of MAG5/SEC16A, recruitment of the COPII coat to ERESs was accelerated.

The greater value for the condylar position index indicates a better balance of the head, that for the condylar angle reflects the more vertical orientation of the vertebral column while that for the corrected nuchal area suggests a less effective nuchal musculature in H. sapiens as compared to the apes. In the casts of the Neanderthal crania, the values all came within, or close to, the ranges for H. sapiens. In the australopithecine casts, the condylar angle cane within the ranges for H. sapiens while the condylar position index and the corrected nuchal area were intermediate in value between H. sapiens and the extant apes.

The embodied language theory, however, in proposing that language includes gestures, provides an avenue for tracing language origins to phylogenetically earlier ancestral species. Here, evidence is presented that the structure of functional hand movements (e.g., reaching for food, climbing a ladder, or crawling), in rats and humans is similar. The structure of these functional hand movements is then compared to speech-related hand gestures in humans. The sequence of language-related gestures are also found to be characteristic of functional hand movements. It is suggested that these findings show that the arm and hand gestures that accompany human speech are derived from the same neural substrates that produce functional movements. Additionally, evidence is reviewed that supports the idea that speech-related gestures resemble the movements elicited by long-train stimulation of the primate motor cortex. Together, this evidence suggests that speech-related hand gestures have their evolutionary origins in functional hand movements of ancestral non-primate and primate species and may be constrained by the neural substrate for those movements.

Therefore, besides experiment methods, many computational methods are proposed to identify essential proteins. Based on the centrality-lethality rule, various centrality methods are employed to predict essential proteins in a Protein-protein Interaction Network (PIN). However, neglecting the temporal and spatial features of protein-protein interactions, the centrality scores calculated by centrality methods are not effective enough for measuring the essentiality of proteins in a PIN. Moreover, many methods, which overfit with the features of essential proteins for one species, may perform poor for other species. In this paper, we demonstrate that the centrality-lethality rule also exists in Protein Subcellular Localization Interaction Networks (PSLINs). To do this, a method based on Localization Specificity for Essential protein Detection (LSED), was proposed, which can be combined with any centrality method for calculating the improved centrality scores by taking into consideration PSLINs in which proteins play their roles. In this study, LSED was combined with eight centrality methods separately to calculate Localization-specific Centrality Scores (LCSs) for proteins based on the PSLINs of four species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster). Compared to the proteins with high centrality scores measured from the global PINs, more proteins with high LCSs measured from PSLINs are essential. It indicates that proteins with high LCSs measured from PSLINs are more likely to be essential and the performance of centrality methods can be improved by LSED.

More importantly, the endogenous threonine 44 (T44)-phosphorylated form of C16orf74 interacted with the protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP3CA) via the PDIIIT sequence in the PPP3CA-binding motif within the middle portion of C16orf74 in PDAC cells. The overexpression of mutants of C16orf74 lacking the PDIIIT sequence or T44 phosphorylation resulted in the suppression of invasive activity compared with wild-type C16orf74, indicating that their interaction should be indispensable for PDAC cell invasion. These results suggest that C16orf74 plays an important role for PDAC invasion and proliferation, and is a promising target for a specific treatment for patients with PDAC.",6.359,624

We disagree. In our view, Beller et al.'s view of the scope of what anthropology can offer cognitive science is too narrow. In focusing on anthropology's role in elucidating cultural particulars, they downplay the fact that anthropology can reveal both variation and universals in human cognition, and is in a unique position to do so relative to the other subfields of cognitive science. Indeed, without cross-cultural research, the universality of any aspect of human cognition cannot truly be established. Therefore, if the goal of cognitive science is to understand the cognitive capacities of our species as a whole, then it cannot do without anthropology. We briefly review a growing body of anthropological work aimed at answering questions about human cognition and offer suggestions for future work.",3.063,135

While it provides a great opportunity to explore genome-scale transcriptional patterns with tremendous depth, it comes with prohibitive costs. Establishing a minimal sequencing depth for required accuracy will guide cost-effective experimental design and promote the routine application of RNA-seq. To address this issue, we selected 36 RNA-seq datasets, each with more than 20 million reads from six widely-used model organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, and Arabidopsis thaliana, and investigated statistical correlations between the sequencing depth and the outcome accuracy. To achieve this, we randomly chose reads from each dataset, mapped them to the reference genomes, and analyzed the accuracy achieved with varying coverage. Our results indicated that as low as one million reads can provide the same sequencing accuracy in transcript abundance (r=0.99) as >30 million reads for highly-expressed genes in all six species. Because many metabolically and pathologically-relevant genes are highly expressed, our findings might be instructive for cost-effective experimental designs in NGS-based research and also provide useful guidance to similar research for other organisms.",2.138,822

 di anatomia ed embriologia",2015,"BACKGROUND: Overall, the comparative data available on the timing of metopic suture closure in present-day and fossil members of human lineage, as well as great apes, seem to indicate that human brain evolution occurred within a complex network of fetopelvic constraints, which required modification of frontal neurocranial ossification patterns, involving delayed fusion of the metopic suture. It is very interesting that the recent sequencing of the Neanderthal genome has revealed signs of positive selection in the modern human variant of the RUNX2 gene, which is known to affect metopic suture fusion in addition to being essential for osteoblast development and proper bone formation. It is possible that an evolutionary change in RUNX2, affecting aspects of the morphology of the upper body and cranium, was of importance in the origin of modern humans. Thus, to contribute to a better understanding of the molecular evolution of this gene probably implicated in human evolution, we performed a comparative bioinformatic analysis of the coding sequences of RUNX2 in Homo sapiens and other non-human Primates. RESULTS: We found amino-acid sequence differences between RUNX2 protein isoforms of Homo sapiens and the other Primates examined, that might have important implications for the timing of metopic suture closure. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to clear the potential distinct developmental roles of different species-specific RUNX2 N-terminal isoforms. Meantime, our bioinformatic analysis, regarding expression of the RUNX2 gene in Homo sapiens and other non-human Primates, has provided a contribution to this important issue of human evolution.",0.791,252

To search for corresponding differences in leukotriene biosynthesis, we screened the Neandertal genome for LOX genes and found that, as modern humans, this archaic hominid contains six LOX genes (nALOX15, nALOX12, nALOX5, nALOX15B, nALOX12B, and nALOXE3) and one pseudogene. In the Neandertal genome, 60-75% of the amino acids of the different human LOX isoforms have been identified, and the degree of identity varies between 96 and 99%. Most functional amino acids (iron ligands, specificity determinants, calcium and ATP-binding sites, membrane-binding determinants, and phosphorylation sites) are well conserved in the Neandertal LOX isoforms, and expression of selected neandertalized human LOX mutants revealed no major functional defects. However, in nALOX12 and nALOXE3, two premature stop codons were found, leading to inactive enzyme species. These data suggest that ALOX15, ALOX5, ALOX15B, and ALOX12B should have been present as functional enzymes in H. neanderthalensis and that in contrast to lower nonhuman primates (M. mulatta) and other mammals (mice, rats), this ancient hominid expressed a 15-lipoxygenating ALOX15.

Human migrations, after thousands of years of permanent settlement in those lands, resulted in seven prototypes of genetic populations of H. pylori with distinct geographical distributions. In all continents, present day isolates of H. pylori have molecular markers that reflect population migrations. The colonization of the Americas as well as the slave trade introduced European and African strains to the New World. The relationship between H. pylori genome and gastric cancer rates is linked to the presence of the cagA gene, but the knowledge on this subject is incomplete because other genes may be involved in certain populations. A new situation for Homo sapiens is the absence of H. pylori colonization in certain, mostly affluent, populations, apparently brought about by improved home sanitation and widespread use of antibiotics during the last decades. The disappearance of H. pylori from the human microbiota may be linked to emerging epidemics of esophageal adenocarcinoma, some allergic diseases such as asthma and some autoimmune disorders.",1.81,1451
1887664,The jump as a fast mode of locomotion in arboreal and terrestrial biotopes.,"['Gunther MM', 'Ishida H', 'Kumakura H', 'Nakano Y']",Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie,1991,"The jump is always used for locomotion. For its execution in arboreal and terrestrial biotopes the requirements are of somewhat different nature. In an arboreal biotope the jump is characterized by a rapid progression through discontinuous substrates and the ability to take off from a small area and a secure landing on a spot. This requires well coordinated movements in all phases of the jump. On the ground, the jump is less frequent and often used for crossing obstacles or gaps. In primates both variants can be observed. In order to relate the details of locomotor behaviour to a certain environment, the biomechanics of jumping are analyzed in five primate species: The three mainly arboreal prosimian species Galago moholi, the smallest and most specialized leaper of all, Galago garnettii, a medium-sized bushbaby with some capacities for jumping, and Lemur catta also with some abilities to jump. The two simian species, Macaca fuscata and Homo sapiens, are usually terrestrial and have good jumping capacities, although not in terms of quantity. The investigation is based on high-speed motion analyses (100-500 frames/second) and the synchronized records of a force-plate from which all subjects had to jump off. On the basis of the results two kinds of jumping can be distinguished: standing and running jumps. The three prosimian species perform standing jumps. Dorsiflexion of their tails compensates ventrally oriented rotational moments of the trunk during body extension at take-off. The upward arm swing yields an overall increase in take-off velocity without additional muscular force exerted by the legs. The main difference among the species are the high relative forces in the small Galago moholi (up to 13 times body weight) as compared to the larger G. garnettii (8.5 times body weight) and the even larger Lemur catta (4.5 times body weight). In Homo sapiens the standing jump is characterized by an extensive arm swing backward, which is then followed by a forward and upward movement. The velocity at take-off is much smaller if compared to the prosimians. The running jump in Macaca fuscata is always preceded by at least one gallop cycle. The body assumes a ball shape at the beginning of the actual take-off. This is advantageous for rotating the body into a position in which the trunk axis is in line with the direction of movement. The tail of the Japanese macaque is too short to compensate the trunk's lift exerted on the hip region by the extending hindlimbs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0,1769

Zinc concentrations in cartilage with adjacent compact bone and in spongy bone were highest in foxes ( approximately 120 mg/kg dry weight (dw)) and lowest in dogs (80 mg/kg dw). Copper concentrations in cartilage with adjacent compact bone were greatest in foxes (1.17 mg/kg dw) and smallest in humans ( approximately 0.8 mg/kg dw), while in spongy bone they were greatest in dogs (0.76 mg/kg dw) and lowest in foxes (0.45 mg/kg dw).

CD5L influences the monocyte inflammatory response to the bacterial surface molecules lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) by inhibiting TNF secretion. Here we studied the intracellular events that lead to macrophage TNF inhibition by human CD5L. To accomplish this goal, we performed functional analyses with human monocytic THP1 macrophages, as well as with peripheral blood monocytes. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) reversed the inhibitory effect of CD5L on TNF secretion. Among the various PtdIns3K isoforms, our results indicated that CD5L activates PtdIns3K (whose catalytic subunit is termed PIK3C3), a key modulator involved in autophagy. Further analysis revealed a concomitant enhancement of autophagy markers such as cellular LC3-II content, increased LC3 puncta, as well as LC3-LysoTracker Red colocalization. Moreover, electron microscopy showed an increased presence of cytosolic autophagosomes in THP1 macrophages overexpressing CD5L. Besides preventing TNF secretion, CD5L also inhibited IL1B and enhanced IL10 secretion. This macrophage anti-inflammatory pattern of CD5L was reverted upon silencing of autophagy protein ATG7 by siRNA transfection. Additional siRNA experiments in THP1 macrophages indicated that the induction of autophagy mechanisms by CD5L was achieved through cell-surface scavenger receptor CD36, a multiligand receptor expressed in a wide variety of cell types. Our data represent the first evidence that CD36 is involved in autophagy and point to a significant contribution of the CD5L-CD36 axis to the induction of macrophage autophagy.",11.753,577

All alpha-subunits are of similar length, with groupings of four and six helices in the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. Minimal homology was seen for protein domain patterns in Paramecium and Hydra, with high correlation between Hydra and vertebrates. Paramecium alpha-subunits display extensive disorder, with minimal helix contacts. Increases in helix contacts in Hydra approached vertebrates. Protein motifs known to be associated with membrane lipid rafts and cell signaling reveal significant positional shifts between Paramecium and Hydra vulgaris, indicating that regional membrane fluidity changes occur during evolution.

The simulation of ribosomes' movement is interactive and allows modifying the coding sequence on the fly. It also enables uploading any coding sequence and simulating its translation in one of three model organisms. In such a case, ribosomes propagate according to mean codon elongation times of the host organism, which may prove useful for heterologous expression.

Y lineages of indigenous Sahul origin belonged to haplogroups C-M130*(xM8,M38,M217,M347) (1%), C-M347 (19%), K-M526*(xM147,P308,P79,P261,P256,M231,M175,M45,P202) (12%), S-P308 (12%), and M-M186 (0.9%). Haplogroups C-M347, K-M526*, and S-P308 are Aboriginal Australian-specific. Dating of C-M347, K-M526*, and S-P308 indicates that all are at least 40,000 years old, confirming their long-term presence in Australia. Haplogroup C-M347 comprised at least three sub-haplogroups: C-DYS390.1del, C-M210, and the unresolved paragroup C-M347*(xDYS390.1del,M210). CONCLUSIONS: There was some geographic structure to the Y-haplogroup variation, but most haplogroups were present throughout Australia. The age of the Australian-specific Y-haplogroups suggests New Guineans and Aboriginal Australians have been isolated for over 30,000 years, supporting findings based on mitochondrial DNA data. Our data support the hypothesis of more than one route (via New Guinea) for males entering Sahul some 50,000 years ago and give no support for colonization events during the Holocene, from either India or elsewhere.",2.379,706

There were 252 reported Homo sapiens genes containing the repeats (AC)n, (GT)n, (AG)n or (CT)n in their UTRs including 22 (8.7%) with diSSR-upstream flanking sequences conserved comparing divergent mammalian lineages represented by Homo sapiens and the marsupial, Monodelphis domestica. Of these 22 genes, 19 had known functions including 18 (95%) that proved critical for mammalian nervous systems (Fishers exact test, P<0.0001). The remaining gene, Cd2ap, proved critical for development of kidney podocytes, cells that have multiple similarities to neurons. Gene functions included voltage and chloride channels, synapse-associated proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, axon and dendrite pathfinders, a NeuroD potentiator and other neuronal activities. Repeat length polymorphism was confirmed for 68% of CFS diSSRs even though these repeats were nestled among highly conserved sequences. This finding supports a hypothesis that SSR polymorphism has functional implications. A parallel study was performed on the self-complementary diSSRs (AT)n and (GC)n. When flanked by conserved sequences, the self-complementary diSSR (AT)n was also associated with genes expressed in the developing nervous system. Our findings implicate functional roles for diSSRs in nervous system development.",2.138,1750

During the past decade, foramen magnum position has been cited as evidence of the hominid status of Ardipithecus and Sahelanthropus. Specifically, the basion of Ardpithecus is reported to be inline with the bicarotid chord, while the basion of Sahelanthropus is reported to both touch the biporion chord and intersect the bicarotid chord. In order to assess the effectiveness of anteroposterior foramen magnum position in distinguishing hominids from nonhominid apes, this study examined whether or not the positions of biporion and bicarotid relative to basion sufficiently distinguished Pan troglodytes from recent Homo sapiens and Plio-Pleistocene hominids. The distances from basion to the biporion chord (BSBIP) and from basion to the bicarotid chord (BSBIC) were measured on samples of chimpanzee (n = 69) and recent human (n = 42) crania and a sample of Plio-Pleistocene hominid fossils (n = 8). The data were used to test the hypothesis that BSBIP and BSBIC measurements do not sufficiently distinguish P. troglodytes from hominids. While basion to biporion (BSBIP) does not effectively distinguish P. troglodytes from Plio-Pleistocene hominids and humans when used univariately, basion to bicarotid (BSBIC), when used univariately or bivariately with BSBIP, can be used to test whether or not an unknown specimen is a hominid. These results are used to evaluate the hominid status of Ardipithecus and Sahelanthropus.",2.379,271

 Series B, Biological sciences",2015,"As a species-typical trait of Homo sapiens, musicality represents a cognitively complex and biologically grounded capacity worthy of intensive empirical investigation. Four principles are suggested here as prerequisites for a successful future discipline of bio-musicology. These involve adopting: (i) a multicomponent approach which recognizes that musicality is built upon a suite of interconnected capacities, of which none is primary; (ii) a pluralistic Tinbergian perspective that addresses and places equal weight on questions of mechanism, ontogeny, phylogeny and function; (iii) a comparative approach, which seeks and investigates animal homologues or analogues of specific components of musicality, wherever they can be found; and (iv) an ecologically motivated perspective, which recognizes the need to study widespread musical behaviours across a range of human cultures (and not focus solely on Western art music or skilled musicians). Given their pervasiveness, dance and music created for dancing should be considered central subcomponents of music, as should folk tunes, work songs, lullabies and children's songs. Although the precise breakdown of capacities required by the multicomponent approach remains open to debate, and different breakdowns may be appropriate to different purposes, I highlight four core components of human musicality--song, drumming, social synchronization and dance--as widespread and pervasive human abilities spanning across cultures, ages and levels of expertise. Each of these has interesting parallels in the animal kingdom (often analogies but in some cases apparent homologies also). Finally, I suggest that the search for universal capacities underlying human musicality, neglected for many years, should be renewed. The broad framework presented here illustrates the potential for a future discipline of bio-musicology as a rich field for interdisciplinary and comparative research.",2.147,804

BTRC gene (Homo sapiens beta-transducing repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) encoded protein, beta-TrCP, is a novel regulator of p53. The current study aimed to assess the possible effects of TP53 IVS3 16 bp (rs17878362) and beta-TrCP 9 bp (rs16405) INS/DEL polymorphisms on BC risk in an Iranian population. A total of 439 women including 236 BC patients and 203 healthy women were recruited. The TP53 and beta-TrCP INS/DEL polymorphisms were genotyped by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method. Our data demonstrated that the TP53 16-bp INS/DEL variation was associated with an increased risk of BC in codominant (INS/INS vs. DEL/DEL: OR=1.82; 95% CI=1.02-3.23; P=0.042) and dominant (Del/INS+INS/INS vs. DEL/DEL: OR=1.48; 95% CI=1.03-2.21; P=0.044) models. Additionally, the variant allele (INS) of TP53 DEL/INS polymorphism with a relatively higher frequency in cases than in controls (35.6 vs. 27.8) was a risk factor for BC (OR=1.43; 95% CI=1.06-1.93; P=0.017). With respect to beta-TrCP INS/DEL polymorphism, our study failed to find any difference in allele and genotype distribution between BC patients and controls in codominant, dominant and recessive tested inheritance models (P>0.05). Furthermore, no significant association among the beta-TrCP and TP53 genotype distribution and clinical characteristics of BC patients were found (P>0.05).

By contrast, the relative size of the tongue has not been reduced, implying a rearrangement of the space at the back of the vocal tract to allow breathing and swallowing. This may have left a morphological signature such as a chin (mental prominence) that can potentially be interpreted in Homo. Long considered an autopomorphic trait of Homo sapiens, various extinct hominins show different forms of mental prominence. These features may be the evolutionary by-product of equivalent developmental constraints correlated with an enlarged tongue. In order to investigate developmental mechanisms related to this hypothesis, we compare modern 34 human infants against 8 chimpanzee fetuses, whom development of the mandibular symphysis passes through similar stages. The study sets out to test that the shared ontogenetic shape changes of the symphysis observed in both species are driven by the same factor--space restriction at the back of the vocal tract and the associated arrangement of the tongue and hyoid bone. We apply geometric morphometric methods to extensive three-dimensional anatomical landmarks and semilandmarks configuration, capturing the geometry of the cervico-craniofacial complex including the hyoid bone, tongue muscle and the mandible. We demonstrate that in both species, the forward displacement of the mental region derives from the arrangement of the tongue and hyoid bone, in order to cope with the relative horizontal narrowing of the oral cavity. Because humans and chimpanzees share this pattern of developmental integration, the different forms of mental prominence seen in some extinct hominids likely originate from equivalent ontogenetic constraints. Variations in this process could account for similar morphologies.",3.234,1117

The precise positioning of the nucleosome cores allows for selective access to the DNA, and the mechanisms that control this positioning are important pieces of the gene expression puzzle. We describe a large-scale nucleosome pattern that jointly characterizes the nucleosome core and the adjacent linkers and is predominantly characterized by long-range oscillations in the mono, di- and tri-nucleotide content of the DNA sequence, and we show that this pattern can be used to predict nucleosome positions in both Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae more accurately than previously published methods. Surprisingly, in both H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae, the most informative individual features are the mono-nucleotide patterns, although the inclusion of di- and tri-nucleotide features results in improved performance. Our approach combines a much longer pattern than has been previously used to predict nucleosome positioning from sequence-301 base pairs, centered at the position to be scored-with a novel discriminative classification approach that selectively weights the contributions from each of the input features. The resulting scores are relatively insensitive to local AT-content and can be used to accurately discriminate putative dyad positions from adjacent linker regions without requiring an additional dynamic programming step and without the attendant edge effects and assumptions about linker length modeling and overall nucleosome density. Our approach produces the best dyad-linker classification results published to date in H. sapiens, and outperforms two recently published models on a large set of S. cerevisiae nucleosome positions. Our results suggest that in both genomes, a comparable and relatively small fraction of nucleosomes are well-positioned and that these positions are predictable based on sequence alone.

VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are considered as specific markers of canonical glutamatergic neurons, while VGLUT3 is found in neurons previously shown to use other neurotransmitters than glutamate. Although there exists a rich literature on the localization of these glutamatergic markers in the rodent brain, little is currently known about the distribution of VGLUT1-3 in the human brain. In the present study, using subtype specific probes and antisera, we examined the localization of the three vesicular glutamate transporters in the human brain by in situ hybridization, immunoautoradiography and immunohistochemistry. We found that the VGLUT1 transcript was highly expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, whereas VGLUT2 mRNA was mainly found in the thalamus and brainstem. VGLUT3 mRNA was localized in scarce neurons within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and raphe nuclei. Following immunoautoradiographic labeling, intense VGLUT1- and VGLUT2-immunoreactivities were observed in all regions investigated (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, cerebellum, thalamus, amygdala, substantia nigra, raphe) while VGLUT3 was absent from the thalamus and cerebellum.

Very little work has been reported in functional prediction of eukaryotes such as mouse and Homo sapiens species from phylogenetic profiles. RESULTS: We have proposed a general methodology for validating the hypothesis underlying phylogenetic profiling techniques, and have demonstrated it using eukaryotic target genomes such as Homo sapiens and mouse. The gene ontology is used as the gold standard for validating functional similarity among the genes in each cluster. We compute the functional cohesiveness of each cluster and the results appeared to be not encouraging towards finding functionally cohesive phylogenetic profiles. This result complements one recent work on the poor performance on functional linkage in some eukaryotic genome using phylogenetic profiling techniques. If we introduce a broad interpretation for functionally related genes as functional sub-clustering within a phylogenetic profile, then we have a very strong support for the hypothesis as we have shown in the paper.",2.576,1733

While all of these four species express Fimbrin and EB1, the lists of CH containing multidomain proteins, however, differ in number and in type for each of them. There was no further great increase in the number of new single domain proteins. Still many new multidomain genes evolved--but far more so in metazoans--than in plants or fungi. In both plants and fungi only singlet CH domains but no doublets (other than those forming the Fimbrin quadruplet) were incorporated. That is in these two branches one finds no alpha actinin, dystrophin or filamin even though the individual building blocks (i.e. domains such as spectrin or IG-FLMN) were available in Arabidopsis.

The nature of this relationship is unclear, however. Humans are more commonly afflicted with spinal disease than are non-human primates and one suggested explanation for this is the stress placed on the spine by bipedalism. With this in mind, we carried out a study of human, chimpanzee, and orangutan vertebrae to examine the links between vertebral shape, locomotion, and Schmorl's nodes, which are bony indicators of vertical intervertebral disc herniation. We tested the hypothesis that vertical disc herniation preferentially affects individuals with vertebrae that are towards the ancestral end of the range of shape variation within Homo sapiens and therefore are less well adapted for bipedalism. RESULTS: The study employed geometric morphometric techniques. Two-dimensional landmarks were used to capture the shapes of the superior aspect of the body and posterior elements of the last thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae of chimpanzees, orangutans, and humans with and without Schmorl's nodes. These data were subjected to multivariate statistical analyses. Canonical Variates Analysis indicated that the last thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae of healthy humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans can be distinguished from each other (p<0.028), but vertebrae of pathological humans and chimpanzees cannot (p>0.4590). The Procrustes distance between pathological humans and chimpanzees was found to be smaller than the one between pathological and healthy humans. This was the case for both vertebrae. Pair-wise MANOVAs of Principal Component scores for both the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae found significant differences between all pairs of taxa (p<0.029), except pathological humans vs chimpanzees (p>0.367). Together, these results suggest that human vertebrae with Schmorl's nodes are closer in shape to chimpanzee vertebrae than are healthy human vertebrae. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that intervertebral disc herniation preferentially affects individuals with vertebrae that are towards the ancestral end of the range of shape variation within H. sapiens and therefore are less well adapted for bipedalism. This finding not only has clinical implications but also illustrates the benefits of bringing the tools of evolutionary biology to bear on problems in medicine and public health.",3.368,556

Temporal characteristics regarding the visibility of target stimuli, displayed as functions of temporal asynchrony between target and mask stimuli, differed with the mask type in chimpanzees as in humans. Peak deterioration in visibility occurred at the point of minimum temporal asynchrony both in forward and backward masking by noise, but was not at 0 ms temporal asynchrony when the target and mask stimuli did not spatially overlap.

The inverted teat defect is influenced by genetic factors, but the number and identity of relevant genes are unknown. In this study, we compared the mRNA expression of teat tissues from unaffected pigs and affected pigs by using microarrays. Simultaneously, 24,123 probe sets were screened, of which some 15,000 had present calls and were analyzed for differential expression between mesenchymal and epithelial tissue of 3 categories of teats (i.e., normal teats of unaffected and affected animals, and inverted teats of the latter). Differential expression was more pronounced in epithelial than in mesenchymal tissue, and the comparisons among the 3 categories of teats showed that local processes at the side of the affected area as well as processes taking place at the level of the organ contribute to the development of inverted teats. Genes related to biofunctions of cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and replacement; organismal, organ, and tissue development; genetic information and nucleic acid processing; and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction were differentially expressed, depending on the teat phenotype and the status of the animal as affected or unaffected. In particular, genes encoding members of canonical pathways of growth factor signaling were highlighted. Complementary to previous real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR experiments showing upregulation of growth factors (epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor) and their receptors in the inverted teat, here it is shown that the abundance of transcripts encoding subordinated proteins (acid phosphatase 1, soluble; activating transcription factor 2; casein kinase 2, alpha 1 polypeptide; casein kinase 2, alpha prime polypeptide; actinin, alpha 2; and Homo sapiens growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) within the growth factor signaling pathways are also affected.

The progressive increase in biological complexity over geologic time is thus the consequence of the information-generating power of energy flow plus the information-accumulating capacity of DNA, winnowed by natural selection. Consequently, the most important component of the biological environment is energy flow: the availability of calories and their use for growth, survival, and reproduction. Animals can exploit and adapt to available energy resources at three levels. They can evolve different anatomical forms through nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutations permitting exploitation of alternative energy reservoirs, resulting in new species. They can evolve modified bioenergetic physiologies within a species, primarily through the high mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded bioenergetic genes, permitting adjustment to regional energetic environments. They can alter the epigenomic regulation of the thousands of dispersed bioenergetic genes via mitochondrially generated high-energy intermediates permitting individual accommodation to short-term environmental energetic fluctuations. Because medicine pertains to a single species, Homo sapiens, functional human variation often involves sequence changes in bioenergetic genes, most commonly mtDNA mutations, plus changes in the expression of bioenergetic genes mediated by the epigenome. Consequently, common nDNA polymorphisms in anatomical genes may represent only a fraction of the genetic variation associated with the common",9.674,1706

Humans reached arctic regions and oceanic islands last-arctic North America about 5 kya, mid- and eastern Pacific islands about 2-1 kya, and New Zealand about 700 y ago. Initial routes along coasts seem the most likely given abundant and easily harvested shellfish there as indicated by huge ancient oyster shell middens on all continents. Nevertheless, the effect of geographic barriers-mountains and oceans-is clear. The phylogeographic pattern of diasporas from several single origins-northeast Africa to Eurasia, southeast Eurasia to Australia, and northeast Siberia to the Americas-allows the equivalent of a repeat experiment on the relation between geography and phylogenetic and cultural diversity. On all continents, cultural diversity is high in productive low latitudes, presumably because such regions can support populations of sustainable size in a small area, therefore allowing a high density of cultures. Of course, other factors operate. South America has an unusually low density of cultures in its tropical latitudes.

However, the Wasiriya Beds of Rusinga Island, Kenya, preserve a Pleistocene sedimentary archive with radiocarbon age estimates of >33-45 ka that contains Middle Stone Age artifacts and abundant, well-preserved fossil fauna: a co-occurrence rare in eastern Africa, particularly in the region bounding Lake Victoria. Artifacts and fossils are associated with distal volcanic ash deposits that occur at multiple localities in the Wasiriya Beds, correlated on the basis of geochemical composition as determined by electron probe microanalysis. Sediment lithology and the fossil ungulates suggest a local fluvial system and associated riparian wooded habitat within a predominantly arid grassland setting that differs substantially from the modern environment, where local climate is strongly affected by moisture availability from Lake Victoria. In particular, the presence of oryx (Oryx gazella) and Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) suggest a pre-Last Glacial Maximum expansion of arid grasslands, an environmental reconstruction further supported by the presence of several extinct specialized grazers (Pelorovis antiquus, Megalotragus sp., and a small alcelaphine) that are unknown from Holocene deposits in eastern Africa. The combination of artifacts, a rich fossil fauna, and volcaniclastic sediments makes the Wasiriya Beds a key site for examining the Lake Victoria basin, a biogeographically important area for understanding the diversification and dispersal of Homo sapiens from Africa, whose pre-Last Glacial Maximum history remains poorly understood.",3.733,1603

We report first-of-its-kind computational method DisoRDPbind for high-throughput prediction of RNA, DNA and protein binding residues located in IDRs from protein sequences. DisoRDPbind is implemented using a runtime-efficient multi-layered design that utilizes information extracted from physiochemical properties of amino acids, sequence complexity, putative secondary structure and disorder and sequence alignment. Empirical tests demonstrate that it provides accurate predictions that are competitive with other predictors of disorder-mediated protein binding regions and complementary to the methods that predict RNA- and DNA-binding residues annotated based on crystal structures. Application in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster proteomes reveals that RNA- and DNA-binding proteins predicted by DisoRDPbind complement and overlap with the corresponding known binding proteins collected from several sources. Also, the number of the putative protein-binding regions predicted with DisoRDPbind correlates with the promiscuity of proteins in the corresponding protein-protein interaction networks.

Aging is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and a number of genetic studies have utilized Bombyx mori (B. mori) as a model, making it possible to use B. mori to investigate Alzheimer's disease. However, the homologous gene of human PS in B. mori has remained to be elucidated. In the present study, the PS homologue gene in B. mori was identified and characterized, and six B. mori presenilin (BmPS) mRNA transcripts were generated by selecting multiple transcription start sites and/or alternative splice sites. The longest mRNA of BmPS (termed BmPS1) contains a 153 nt 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 1,440 nt open reading frame and a 1,063 nt 3' UTR. The predicted protein of BmPS1 consists of 479 amino acid residues and has two highlyconserved aspartate residues, which form the catalytic core of aspartic proteases. It exhibits a sequence identity of ~44 and 51% with homologues in Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. However, the amino acid sequence of the BmPS loop region does not completely match between the two B. mori strains R13Q and Dazao. Genomic analysis revealed that B. mori had a single copy of the BmPS gene, which was composed of 14 exons. A total of four isoforms of BmPS (BmPSA, B, C and D) owing to multiple transcriptional start sites and alternative splice sites were identified. The alternative splicing events occurring in the loop region improved the diversity of the BmPS protein and were detectable in all tissues, as determined using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). Furthermore, the expression levels of BmPS in the brain at different developmental stages were detected using RTqPCR, and significantly higher expression levels of BmPS were found in the adult stage compared with those in the larval and pupal stages. The present study on BmPS provided insight into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and mechanisms of silkworm developmental regulation.",1.554,786

Homoarginine deficiency may be related to renal and heart diseases, but the pathophysiologic role of homoarginine and the genetic regulation of its serum levels are largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 3041 patients of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study referred for coronary angiography and 2102 participants of the Young Finns Study (YFS), we performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic loci associated with homoarginine serum levels and tested for associations of identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms with mortality in LURIC. We found genome-wide significant associations with homoarginine serum levels on chromosome 2 at the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I locus, on chromosome 5 at the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 locus, and on chromosome 15 at the glycine amidinotransferase locus, as well as a suggestive association on chromosome 6 at the Homo sapiens mediator complex subunit 23 gene/arginase I locus. All loci harbor enzymes located in the mitochondrium are involved in arginine metabolism. The strongest association was observed for rs1153858 at the glycine amidinotransferase locus with a P value of 1.25E-45 in the combined analysis and has been replicated in both the Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie (4D study) and the Graz Endocrine Causes of Hypertension (GECOH) study.

To develop a comprehensive knowledge of the genes expressed during normal neurulation, we established transcriptomes from human neural tube fragments during and after neurulation using long Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (long-SAGE). METHODS: Rostral and caudal neural tubes were dissected from normal human embryos aged between 26 and 32 days of gestation. Tissues from the same region and Carnegie stage were pooled (n >/= 4) and total RNA extracted to construct four long-SAGE libraries. Tags were mapped using the UniGene Homo sapiens 17 bp tag-to-gene best mapping set. Differentially expressed genes were identified by chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and validation was performed for a subset of those transcripts using in situ hybridization. In silico analyses were performed with BinGO and EXPANDER. RESULTS: We observed most genes to be similarly regulated in rostral and caudal regions, but expression profiles differed during and after closure. In silico analysis found similar enrichments in both regions for biologic process terms, transcription factor binding and miRNA target motifs. Twelve genes potentially expressing alternate isoforms by region or developmental stage, and the microRNAs miR-339-5p, miR-141/200a, miR-23ab, and miR-129/129-5p are among several potential candidates identified here for future research.

FINDINGS: The genomic sequence for P. vitticeps, generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, comprised 317 Gbp (179X raw read depth) from 13 insert libraries ranging from 250 bp to 40 kbp. After filtering for low-quality and duplicated reads, 146 Gbp of data (83X) was available for assembly. Exceptionally high levels of heterozygosity (0.85 % of single nucleotide polymorphisms plus sequence insertions or deletions) complicated assembly; nevertheless, 96.4 % of reads mapped back to the assembled scaffolds, indicating that the assembly included most of the sequenced genome. Length of the assembly was 1.8 Gbp in 545,310 scaffolds (69,852 longer than 300 bp), the longest being 14.68 Mbp. N50 was 2.29 Mbp. Genes were annotated on the basis of de novo prediction, similarity to the green anole Anolis carolinensis, Gallus gallus and Homo sapiens proteins, and P. vitticeps transcriptome sequence assemblies, to yield 19,406 protein-coding genes in the assembly, 63 % of which had intact open reading frames.

On some lists, subjects with no knowledge of the ordinal position of the items were given the opportunity to learn the order of those items by observing an expert model. Children, like monkeys, learned new lists more rapidly in a social condition where they had the opportunity to observe an experienced model perform the list in question, than under a baseline condition in which they had to learn new lists entirely by trial and error. No differences were observed between the accuracy of each species' responses to individual items or in the frequencies with which they made different types of errors.

Since the sequence shared 77% identity with the published full-length Homo sapiens HSP70 protein, it was named Schistosoma mortalin-like protein (MLP/Hsp70). Here, we report the molecular and functional characterization of the Schistosoma japonicum SjMLP/hsp70 as a member of the HSP70 family. The complete SjMLP/hsp70 coding sequence was amplified from a S. japonicum adult worm cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into the pET28a expression vector. The purified recombinant protein, rSjMLP/hsp70, was identified as a member of 70-kDa HSP family by mass spectrometry and could be recognized by the S. japonicum-infected mouse serum. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting analysis revealed that SjMLP/hsp70 was widely expressed in the eggs, cercariae, schistosomula, and adult worms of S. japonicum. A thermotolerance assay showed that rSjMLP/hsp70 could protect Escherichia coli cells from heat damage. This chaperone-like activity was demonstrated by full-length SjMLP/hsp70. The detection of specific antibody levels by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IFN-gamma secretion of splenocytes by ELISpot assay suggested that mice immunized with SjMLP/hsp70 were able to elicit Th1-type bias immune response.

For enzyme genes, our data confirm previous conclusion that the upstream genes have evolved more slowly than downstream genes. Moreover, we found that catabolic genes in the dopamine metabolic pathway have evolved faster than anabolic genes, and maximum likelihood analysis suggested that this difference in evolutionary rate may be explained by anabolic genes being more constrained during selection. For dopamine receptor genes, however, the broadly expressed genes have tended to evolve more slowly than the narrowly expressed genes; maximum likelihood analysis showed that the relatively rapid evolutionary rate of the narrowly expressed receptor genes was a consequence of relaxed selective constraints.

The parasite is prevalent in East and Southeast Asia, including the People's Republic of China, the Philippines and Indonesia. We studied the co-expansion of S. japonicum and its human definitive host. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences showed that S. japonicum radiated from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the mountainous areas of China, Japan and Southeast Asia. In addition, the parasite experienced two population expansions during the Neolithic agriculture era, coinciding with human migration and population growth. The data indicate that the advent of rice planting likely played a key role in the spread of schistosomiasis in Asia.

In contrast, the mutant protein HuAtp12p(E240K), which harbors a lysine at the position of the highly conserved Glu-240, fails to prevent citrate synthase aggregation at 43 degrees C. No significant differences were observed between the wild type and the mutant proteins as judged by sedimentation analysis, cysteine titration, tryptophan emission spectra, or limited proteolysis, which suggests that the E240K mutation alters the activity of HuAtp12p with minimal effects on the physical integrity of the protein. An additional important finding of this work is that the equilibrium chemical denaturation curve of HuAtp12p shows two components, the first of which is associated with protein aggregation. This result is consistent with a model for Atp12p structure in which there is a hydrophobic chaperone domain that is buried within the protein interior.",0,531

Despite this abundance, few bona fide kinase-client relationships have been described in detail. Here we describe a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach for identifying kinase-client proteins. During method development, we used the dedicated kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) for the in vitro assays. As kinase substrate, we used synthetic peptide cocktails and, in the process, demonstrated that the assay is both sensitive and specific. The method is also useful for characterizing protein kinase-substrate kinetics once the peptide substrate is detected. Applying a label-free spectral counting method, the activity of PDK was determined using the peptide substrate YHGH(292)SMSDPGSTYR derived from the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit sequence. The utility of spectral counting was further validated by studying the negative effect of Met oxidation on peptide phosphorylation. We also measured the activity of the unrelated calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3), demonstrating the utility of the method in protein kinase screening applications.",2.219,1712
23958212,Mechanisms of spindle positioning: cortical force generators in the limelight.,"['Kotak S', 'Gonczy P']",Current opinion in cell biology,2013,"Correct positioning of the spindle governs placement of the cytokinesis furrow and thus plays a crucial role in the partitioning of fate determinants and the disposition of daughter cells in a tissue. Converging evidence indicates that spindle positioning is often dictated by interactions between the plus-end of astral microtubules that emanate from the spindle poles and an evolutionary conserved cortical machinery that serves to pull on them. At the heart of this machinery lies a ternary complex (LIN-5/GPR-1/2/Galpha in Caenorhabditis elegans and NuMA/LGN/Galphai in Homo sapiens) that promotes the presence of the motor protein dynein at the cell cortex. In this review, we discuss how the above components contribute to spindle positioning and how the underlying mechanisms are precisely regulated to ensure the proper execution of this crucial process in metazoan organisms.",8.467,1030

Major factors for the fabrication of a successful nucleic acid sensor include the design of probes for target sequence hybridization and their immobilization on the chip surface. Here we demonstrate that a rational choice of bioprobes has important impact on the sensor's analytical performances. Computational evaluations, by a simple and freely available program, successfully led to the design of the best probes for a given target, with direct application to nucleic acid-based sensing. We developed here an optimized and reproducible strategy for in silico probe design supported by optical transduction experiments. In particular Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi), at the forefront of optical sensing, was used here as proof of principle. Five probes were selected, immobilized on gold chip surfaces by widely consolidated thiol chemistry and tested to validate the computational model. Using SPRi as the transducting component, real-time and label free analysis was performed, taking the Homo sapiens actin beta (ACTB) gene fragment as model system in nucleic acid detection. The experimental sensor behavior was further studied by evaluating the strength of the secondary structure of probes using melting experiments. Dedicated software was also used to evaluate probes' folding, to support our criteria. The SPRi experimental results fully validate the computational evaluations, revealing this approach highly promising as a useful tool to design biosensor probes with optimized performances.",6.409,1482
24431992,The mammalian neocortex new pyramidal neuron: a new conception.,['Marin-Padilla M'],Frontiers in neuroanatomy,2014,"The new cerebral cortex (neocortex) and the new type of pyramidal neuron are mammalian innovations that have evolved for operating their increasing motor capabilities while essentially using analogous anatomical and neural makeups. The human neocortex starts to develop in 6-week-old embryos with the establishment of a primordial cortical organization, which resembles the primitive cortices of amphibian and reptiles. From the 8th to the 15th week of age, new pyramidal neurons, of ependymal origin, are progressively incorporated within this primordial cortex forming a cellular plate that divides its components into those above it (neocortex first layer) and those below it (neocortex subplate zone). From the 16th week of age to birth and postnatally, the new pyramidal neurons continue to elongate functionally their apical dendrite by adding synaptic membrane to incorporate the needed sensory information for operating its developing motor activities. The new pyramidal neuron' distinguishing feature is the capacity of elongating anatomically and functionally its apical dendrite (its main receptive surface) without losing its original attachment to first layer or the location of its soma and, hence, retaining its essential nature. The number of pyramidal cell functional strata established in the motor cortex increases and reflects each mammalian species motor capabilities: the hedgehog needs two pyramidal cell functional strata to carry out all its motor activities, the mouse 3, cat 4, primates 5 and humans 6. The presence of six pyramidal cell functional strata distinguish the human motor cortex from that of others primates. Homo sapiens represent a new evolutionary stage that have transformed his primate brain for operating his unique motor capabilities, such as speaking, writing, painting, sculpturing and thinking as a premotor activity. Words used in language are the motor expression of thoughts and represent sounds produced by maneuvering the column of expiratory air by coordinated motor quivering as it passes through the larynx, pharynx, mouth, tongue, and lips.

In this study, we use a combination of 'extended-range' luminescence dating techniques and palaeomagnetism to provide new age constraint on sedimentary infills that are unambiguously associated with the Sima fossil assemblage. Post-infrared-infrared stimulated luminescence (pIR-IR) dating of K-feldspars and thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) dating of individual quartz grains provide weighted mean ages of 433 +/- 15 ka (thousands of years) and 416 +/- 19 ka, respectively, for allochthonous sedimentary horizons overlying the hominin-bearing clay breccia. The six replicate luminescence ages obtained for this deposit are reproducible and provide a combined minimum age estimate of 427 +/- 12 ka for the underlying hominin fossils. Palaeomagnetic directions for the luminescence dated sediment horizon and underlying fossiliferous clays display exclusively normal polarities. These findings are consistent with the luminescence dating results and confirm that the hominin fossil horizon accumulated during the Brunhes Chron, i.e., within the last 780 ka. The new bracketing age constraint for the Sima hominins is in broad agreement with radiometrically dated Homo heidelbergensis fossil sites, such as Mauer and Arago, and suggests that the split of the H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens lineages took place during the early Middle Pleistocene. More widespread numerical dating of key Early and Middle Pleistocene fossil sites across Europe is needed to test and refine competing models of hominin evolution. The new luminescence chronologies presented in this study demonstrate the versatility of TT-OSL and pIR-IR techniques and the potential role they could play in helping to refine evolutionary histories over Middle Pleistocene timescales.",3.733,1275

However, little information is available on the process of tooth development or the exact molecular mechanisms controlling tooth development in miniature pigs or humans. Thus, the analysis of gene expression related to each stage of tooth development is very important. RESULTS: In our study, after serial sections were made, the development of the crown of the miniature pigs' mandibular deciduous molar could be divided into five main phases: dental lamina stage (E33-E35), bud stage (E35-E40), cap stage (E40-E50), early bell stage (E50-E60), and late bell stage (E60-E65). Total RNA was isolated from the tooth germ of miniature pig embryos at E35, E45, E50, and E60, and a cDNA library was constructed. Then, we identified cDNA sequences on a large scale screen for cDNA profiles in the developing mandibular deciduous molars (E35, E45, E50, and E60) of miniature pigs using Illumina Solexa deep sequencing. Microarray assay was used to detect the expression of genes. Lastly, through Unigene sequence analysis and cDNA expression pattern analysis at E45 and E60, we found that 12 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated genes during the four periods are highly conserved genes homologous with known Homo sapiens genes. Furthermore, there were 6 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated genes in the miniature pig that were highly homologous to Homo sapiens genes compared with those in the mouse. CONCLUSION: Our results not only identify the specific transcriptome and cDNA profile in developing mandibular deciduous molars of the miniature pig, but also provide useful information for investigating the molecular mechanism of tooth development in the miniature pig.",2.667,607

METHODS: SNP genotyping data from the International HapMap Project for European, Eastern Asian, and African populations was used to discover differences in haplotype length and allele frequency between these populations. Numeric selection metrics were computed for each SNP and aggregated into gene-level metrics to measure evidence of recent positive selection. The level of recent positive selection in phototransduction genes was evaluated and compared to a set of genes shown previously to be under recent selection, and a set of highly conserved genes as positive and negative controls, respectively. RESULTS: Six of 20 phototransduction genes evaluated had gene-level selection metrics above the 90th percentile: RGS9, GNB1, RHO, PDE6G, GNAT1, and SLC24A1. The selection signal across these genes was found to be of similar magnitude to the positive control genes and much greater than the negative control genes. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for selective pressure in the genes involved in retinal phototransduction, and traces of this selective pressure can be demonstrated using SNP-level and gene-level metrics of allelic variation. We hypothesize that the selective pressure on these genes was related to their role in low light vision and retinal adaptation to ambient light changes. Uncovering the underlying genetics of evolutionary adaptations in phototransduction not only allows greater understanding of vision and visual diseases, but also the development of patient-specific diagnostic and intervention strategies.",3.404,82

Participants had to indicate which dot color was more numerous within the array. All species performed at high and comparable levels, including on trials in which the subset with the larger number of items had a smaller total area of coloration. This indicated a similarity across species to use the number of items in the subsets, and not dimensions such as area or volume, to guide decision making. Discrimination performance was constrained by the ratio between the subsets, consistent with other reports of numerousness judgments of stationary stimuli.

In this study, we selected 214 genes with complete coding sequences on Homo sapiens chromosome 4 (HSA4) to search for orthologs and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in eight other mammalian species (cattle, pig, sheep, goat, horse, dog, cat, and rabbit). In particular, 46 of these genes were used as landmarks for comparative mapping of HSA4 and Sus scrofa chromosome 8 (SSC8); most of HSA4 is homologous to SSC8, which is of particular interest because of its association with genes affecting the reproductive performance of pigs. As a reference framework, the 46 genes were selected to represent different cytogenetic bands on HSA4. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from pig DNA were directly sequenced and their orthologous status was confirmed by a BLAST search. These 46 genes, plus 11 microsatellite markers for SSC8, were typed against DNA from a pig-mouse radiation hybrid (RH) panel with 110 lines. RHMAP analysis assigned these 57 markers to 3 linkage groups in the porcine genome, 52 to SSC8, 4 to SSC15, and 1 to SSC17. By comparing the order and orientation of orthologous landmark genes on the porcine RH maps with those on the human sequence map, HSA4 was recognized as being split into nine conserved segments with respect to the porcine genome, seven with SSC8, one with SSC15, and one with SSC17. With 41 orthologous gene loci mapped, this report provides the largest functional gene map of SSC8, with 30 of these loci representing new single-gene assignments to SSC8.",0,363

The first two species are strongly dimorphic, whereas the New World forms show little dimorphism with regard to overall body size, canines, and brain weight. Neither total corpus callosal area (TOTALCC), or other parts of the corpus callosum (CC) showed any significant sexual dimorphism in any of the primate species sampled. Only in M. mulatta did a sexual dimorphism appear to be significant. In males of this species, the dorsoventral width of the splenium was larger than in females. In addition, the anterior commissure (ANTCOMM) evinced no sexual dimorphism in the different species. Brain weight was significantly dimorphic in only M. mulatta, and when ratio data were used to correct for brain weight, no significant differences were found in the corpus callosum. This is in contrast to Homo sapiens, where the relative size of the CC has been reported to be larger in females, and particularly so in the posterior, or splenial portion of the CC. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the various variables within each species. In general, most of the callosal measures are significantly inter-correlated, although the exact pattern varies for each species. Thus, unlike Homo sapiens, or pongids such as Gorilla and Pan, neither New nor Old World monkeys show any striking evidence for sexual dimorphism in the corpus callosum.",2.379,1803

And the GenBank accession numbers of MYL1a and MYL1b full-length cDNA sequences that we cloned are KJ700419 and KJ710701, respectively. Neither protein was predicted to have a signal peptide, but both were predicted to have several N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. More than half of the secondary structure of these proteins was predicted to be alpha-helical. The human MYL2 protein (1m8q.1.C) is the most similar in tertiary structure.

The definition includes a mosaic of features, some like modern humans (hence derived: genus Homo), some like modern apes and australopithecines (hence primitive: not species sapiens), and some unique (hence new species: floresiensis). Conversely, because only modern humans (H. sapiens) are known in this region in the last 40 thousand years, these individuals have also been suggested to be genetic human dwarfs. Such dwarfs resemble small humans and do not show the mosaic combination of the most complete individuals, LB1 and LB6, so this idea has been largely dismissed. We have previously shown that some features of the cranium of hypothyroid cretins are like those of LB1. Here we examine cretin postcrania to see if they show anatomical mosaics like H. floresiensis. We find that hypothyroid cretins share at least 10 postcranial features with Homo floresiensis and unaffected humans not found in apes (or australopithecines when materials permit). They share with H. floresiensis, modern apes and australopithecines at least 11 postcranial features not found in unaffected humans. They share with H. floresiensis, at least 8 features not found in apes, australopithecines or unaffected humans. Sixteen features can be rendered metrically and multivariate analyses demonstrate that H. floresiensis co-locates with cretins, both being markedly separate from humans and chimpanzees (P<0.001: from analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) over all variables, ANOSIM, global R>0.999).

Between 5-7% of all pregnancies are affected by PE and it is responsible for approximately 50,000 maternal deaths annually. The pathogenesis of PE remains poorly understood. However, the results of this study indicated that insufficient decidualization plays a significant role. NR5A1 and NR5A2 are orphan members of the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors and are involved in mammal follicular development, female reproduction, steroidogenesis, and decidualization. The expression of NR5A1 and NR5A2 in the human decidua and their functions during decidualization were investigated using in vitro cultured cells by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and siRNA techniques. The results demonstrated that the levels of NR5A2 mRNA and protein in the decidual tissues of women with PE were lower than those of normal pregnant women. However, the levels of NR5A1 mRNA and protein did not significantly differ between groups. The expression of NR5A2 was upregulated after in vitro decidualization, but the expression of NR5A1 remained low and showed no difference compared with that of the control cells. Knocking down of NR5A2 in human endometrial stromal cells (hESC) resulted in a significant reduction in their expression of decidualization markers (IGFBP1 and PRL) and signaling pathway molecules (WNT4 and BMP2) (P < 0.05). From these data, we concluded that NR5A2 is pivotal for the decidualization of decidual tissues and cultured human endometrial stromal cells.

There is considerable controversy about the use of 2-dimensional stimuli and the impact that the lack of the 3rd dimension (i.e., depth) may have on animals' performance in tests for their visual and cognitive abilities. We report evidence of discrimination learning using a completely novel type of stimuli, namely, holograms. Like real objects, holograms provide full 3-dimensional shape information but they also offer many possibilities for systematically modifying the appearance of a stimulus. Hence, they provide a promising means for investigating visual perception and cognition of different species in a comparative way. We trained pigeons and humans to discriminate either between 2 real objects or between holograms of the same 2 objects, and we subsequently tested both species for the transfer of discrimination to the other presentation mode. The lack of any decrements in accuracy suggests that real objects and holograms were perceived as equivalent in both species and shows the general appropriateness of holograms as stimuli in visual tasks. A follow-up experiment involving the presentation of novel views of the training objects and holograms revealed some interspecies differences in rotational invariance, thereby confirming and extending the results of previous studies. Taken together, these results suggest that holograms may not only provide a promising tool for investigating yet unexplored issues, but their use may also lead to novel insights into some crucial aspects of comparative visual perception and categorization.",1.52,74

Unfortunately, insecticide resistance is becoming common among different vector species. There are currently no chemical alternatives to these insecticides because new human-safe classes of molecules have yet to be brought to the vector-control market. The identification of novel targets offer opportunities for rational design of new chemistries to control vector populations. One target family, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has remained relatively under explored in terms of insecticide development. METHODS: A novel classifier, Ensemble*, for vector GPCRs was developed. Ensemble* was validated and compared to existing classifiers using a set of all known GPCRs from Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Apis Mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Pediculus humanus. Predictions for unidentified sequences from Ae. aegypti, An. gambiae, and Pe. humanus were validated. Quantitative RT-PCR expression analysis was performed on previously-known and newly discovered Ae. aegypti GPCR genes. RESULTS: We present a new analysis of GPCRs in the genomes of Ae, aegypti, a vector of dengue fever, An. gambiae, a primary vector of Plasmodium falciparum that causes malaria, and Pe. humanus, a vector of epidemic typhus fever, using a novel GPCR classifier, Ensemble*, designed for insect vector species.

Two members of a gene sub-family encoding these proteins, FBXO7 and FBXO32, have been implicated in the onset and progression of degenerative disease. FBXO7 is responsible for rare genetic forms of Parkinson disease, while FBXO32 has been implicated in muscle wasting. The third gene in this family, FBXO9, is related to growth signaling, but the role of this gene in degenerative disease pathways has not been thoroughly investigated. Characterizing the putative Drosophila melanogaster homologue of this gene, CG5961, enables modeling and analysis of the consequence of targeted alteration of gene function and the effects on the overall health of the organism. Comparison of the protein domains of Homo sapiens FBXO9 and the putative D. melanogaster homologue CG5961 revealed a high degree of conservation between the protein domains. Directed expression of CG5961 (via CG5961(EP)) and inhibition of CG5961 (through a stable RNAi transgene) in the developing D. melanogaster eye caused abnormalities in adult structures (ommatidia and inter-ommatidial bristles). Directed expression of either CG5961 or CG5961-RNAi in the dopaminergic neurons led to a reduced lifespan compared to that in lacZ controls. We showed that protein structures of CG5961 and FBXO9 are highly similar and studied the effects of altered expression of CG5961 in neuron-rich tissues. Our results suggest that CG5961 activity is necessary for the proper formation of neuronal tissue and that targeted alteration of gene expression in dopaminergic neurons leads to a reduced lifespan.",0.775,670

Therapeutic options remain inefficient, demanding the search for new drugs and/or new molecular targets. Such efforts can focus on proteins that are specific to the parasite, but analogous enzymes and enzymes with a three-dimensional (3D) structure sufficiently different from the corresponding host proteins may represent equally interesting targets. In order to find these targets we used the workflows MHOLline and AnEnPi obtaining 3D models from homologous, analogous and specific proteins of Trypanosoma cruzi versus Homo sapiens. RESULTS: We applied genome wide comparative modelling techniques to obtain 3D models for 3,286 predicted proteins of T. cruzi. In combination with comparative genome analysis to Homo sapiens, we were able to identify a subset of 397 enzyme sequences, of which 356 are homologous, 3 analogous and 38 specific to the parasite. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we present a set of 397 enzyme models of T. cruzi that can constitute potential structure-based drug targets to be investigated for the development of new strategies to fight Chagas' disease. The strategies presented here support the concept of structural analysis in conjunction with protein functional analysis as an interesting computational methodology to detect potential targets for structure-based rational drug design. For example, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) and triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3), classified as analogous proteins in relation to H. sapiens enzymes, were identified as new potential molecular targets.",3.986,168
21406734,"Comparative evolutionary analyses of beta globin gene in eutherian, dinosaurian and neopterygii taxa.","['Awasthi G', 'Srivastava G', 'Das A']",Journal of vector borne diseases,2011,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses of conserved genes have enabled us to understand the complexity of genomes of closely related species. For example: beta-globin gene present in human hemoglobin is one such gene that has experienced many genetic changes in many related taxa and produced more than 600 variants. One of the variant, HBS causes sickle-cell anemia in humans but offers protection against severe malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum. In the present study, we characterized and performed evolutionary comparative analyses of the ?-globin gene in different related and unrelated taxa to have a comprehensive view of its evolution. METHODS: DNA and protein sequences of beta-globin gene were downloaded from NCBI and characterized in detail in nine eutherian (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus, Canis familiaris, Equus caballus, Oryctolagus cuniculus), a dinosaurian (Gallus gallus) and a neopterygii (Danio rerio) taxa. Three more eutherian (Papio anubis, Ovis aries and Sus scrofa) taxa were included for an analysis at the protein level but not included at the gene level owing to lack of genomic information. Computational and phylogenetic analyses were performed using evolutionary comparative approach. RESULTS: Results of comparative and phylogenetic analyses revealed less conservation of genetic architecture of beta-globin compared to its protein architecture in all eutherian taxa. Both dinosaurian and neopterygii taxa served as outgroups and varied at gene and protein levels. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Most remarkably, all primates from eutherian taxa including P. anubis showed only nine codon position differences and an absolute similarity between H. sapiens and P. troglodytes. Absolute conservation of coding region in Equus caballus (horse) was observed. The results were discussed with an inference on the role of evolutionary forces in maintaining such close similarities and variations across closely related taxa. Further, the need to utilize more comparative approaches in understanding the disease causing genes' evolution in closely related taxa is hoped for.",0.806,1483

Sequence alignments with closely related homologues can reveal conserved regions which are functionally important. Scanning protein motif databases, along with secondary and surface accessibility predictions integrated with post-translational modification sites (PTMs) prediction reveal functional and protein-binding motifs. Integrating this information about the protein with the GO, SCOP, and CATH annotations of the templates can help to formulate a 3D model with reasonable accuracy even in the case of distant sequence homology. A novel integrative model of the non-structural protein 5A of Hepatitis C virus: a hub promiscuous protein with roles in virus replication and host interactions is proposed. The 3D structure for domain II was predicted based on, the Homo sapiens Replication factor-A protein-1 (RPA1), as a template using consensus meta-servers results. Domain III is an intrinsically unstructured domain with a fold from the retroviral matrix protein, which conducts diverse protein interactions and is involved in viral replication and protein interactions. It also has a single-stranded DNA-binding protein motif (SSDP) signature for pyrimidine binding during viral replication. Two protein-binding motifs with high sequence conservation and disordered regions are proposed; the first corresponds to an Interleukin-8B receptor signature (IL-8R-B), while the second has a lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) high local similarity. A mechanism is proposed to their contribution to NS5A Interferon signaling pathway interception. Lastly, the overlapping between LTbetaR and SSDP is considered as a sign for NS5A date hubs.",1.958,1866

The karyotype of all the specimens of Cimex lectularius analysed contained 26 autosomes and a varying number of the sex chromosomes. The number of sex chromosomes showed extensive variation, and up to 20 fragments were recorded. Altogether, 12 distinct karyotypes were distinguished. The male karyotypes consisted of 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 42 and 47 chromosomes. The females usually exhibited the number of chromosomes which was complementary to the number established in the males from the same sample. However, 11 polymorphic samples were revealed in which the karyotypes of females and males were not complementary each other. The complement with 2n = 26+X1X2Y was found in 44% of the specimens and 57,4% samples of bed bugs studied. The karyotypes with higher chromosome numbers as well as individuals with chromosomal mosaics were usually found within the samples exhibiting particularly extensive variation between individuals, and such complements were not found within samples contaning a few or single specimen. The occurrence of chromosomal mosaics with the karyotype constitution varying between cells of single individual was observed in five specimens (4.3%) from five samples. We assume that polymorphism caused by fragmentation of the X chromosome may result in meiotic problems and non-disjunction can produce unbalanced gametes and result in lowered fitness of individuals carrying higher numbers of the X chromosome fragments. This effect should be apparently enhanced with the increasing number of the fragments and this may be the reason for the observed distribution pattern of individual karyotypes in the studied samples and the rarity of individuals with extremely high chromosome numbers. The assumed lowering of the fitness of individuals carrying higher numbers of the X chromosome fragments could affect population dynamics of variable populations.",1.21,1130

Although there has been much focus on specifying the stoichiometric matrix, the predictive power of genome-scale models equally depends on reaction directions. Two-thirds of reactions in the two eukaryotic reconstructions Homo sapiens Recon 1 and Yeast 5 are specified as irreversible. However, these specifications are mainly based on biochemical textbooks or on their similarity to other organisms and are rarely underpinned by detailed thermodynamic analysis. In this study, a to our knowledge new workflow combining network-embedded thermodynamic and flux variability analysis was used to evaluate existing irreversibility constraints in Recon 1 and Yeast 5 and to identify new ones. A total of 27 and 16 new irreversible reactions were identified in Recon 1 and Yeast 5, respectively, whereas only four reactions were found with directions incorrectly specified against thermodynamics (three in Yeast 5 and one in Recon 1). The workflow further identified for both models several isolated internal loops that require further curation. The framework also highlighted the need for substrate channeling (in human) and ATP hydrolysis (in yeast) for the essential reaction catalyzed by phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase in purine metabolism. Finally, the framework highlighted differences in proline metabolism between yeast (cytosolic anabolism and mitochondrial catabolism) and humans (exclusively mitochondrial metabolism). We conclude that network-embedded thermodynamics facilitates the specification and validation of irreversibility constraints in compartmentalized metabolic models, at the same time providing further insight into network properties.",3.972,927

Herein, we further evaluated LINE-1 Homo sapiens (L1Hs) methylation in tissues derived from three germ layers of stillborn NTD fetuses, to define patterns of tissue specific methylation and site-specific hypomethylation at CpG sites within an L1Hs promoter region. Stable, tissue-specific L1Hs methylation patterns throughout three germ layer lineages of the fetus, placenta, and maternal peripheral blood were observed. Samples from maternal peripheral blood exhibited the highest level of L1Hs methylation (64.95%) and that from placenta showed the lowest (26.82%). Between samples from NTDs and controls, decrease in L1Hs methylation was only significant in NTD-affected brain tissue at 7.35%, especially in females (8.98%). L1Hs hypomethylation in NTDs was also associated with a significant increase in expression level of an L1Hs-encoded transcript in females (r = -0.846, p = 0.004). This could be due to genomic DNA instability and alternation in chromatins accessibility resulted from abnormal L1Hs hypomethylation, as showed in this study with HCT-15 cells treated with methylation inhibitor 5-Aza.",3.621,50

Individual recognition requires sufficient cognitive abilities and phenotypic diversity within a population for discrimination to be possible.

Here we demonstrate that faces evolved to signal individual identity under negative frequency-dependent selection. Faces show elevated phenotypic variation and lower between-trait correlations compared with other traits. Regions surrounding face-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms show elevated diversity consistent with frequency-dependent selection. Genetic variation maintained by identity signalling tends to be shared across populations and, for some loci, predates the origin of Homo sapiens.

However, the roles of fish TRIM62 in antiviral immune response remained uncertain. In this study, a TRIM62 gene was cloned from orange spotted grouper (EcTRIM62) and its roles in grouper RNA virus infection was elucidated in vitro. EcTRIM62 shared 99% and 83% identity to bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. Sequence alignment indicated that EcTRIM62 contained three domains, including a RING-finger domain, a B-box domain and a SPRY domain. In healthy grouper, the transcript of EcTRIM62 was predominantly detected in brain and liver, followed by heart, skin, spleen, fin, gill, intestine, and stomach. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that bright fluorescence spots were observed in the cytoplasm of EcTRIM62-transfected grouper spleen (GS) cells. During red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis (RGNNV) infection, overexpression of EcTRIM62 significantly enhanced the severity of CPE and increased viral gene transcriptions. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM62 significantly decreased the transcription level of interferon signaling molecules, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), myxovirus resistance gene MXI, and MXII, suggesting that the negative regulation of interferon immune response by EcTRIM62 might directly contributed to its enhancing effect on RGNNV replication. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that overexpression of EcTRIM62 was able to differently regulate the expression levels of pro-inflammation cytokines. In addition, we found the ectopic expression of EcTIRM62 negatively regulated MDA5-, but not mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA)-induced interferon immune response. Further studies showed that the deletion of RING domain and SPRY domain significantly affected the action of EcTRIM62, including the enhancing effect on virus replication and regulation of interferon immune response. Thus, our studies firstly demonstrated that EcTRIM62 negatively regulated the innate antiviral immune response against fish RNA viruses.",2.674,598

The transformed yeast AH109 was mated with yeast Y187 (alpha type) containing liver cDNA library plasmid in 2XYPDA medium. Diploid yeast was plated on synthetic dropout nutrient medium (SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade) containing X-alpha-gal for selection and screening.

As with other viral pathogens, dengue virus is dependent on its host to perform the bulk of functions necessary for viral survival and replication. To be successful, dengue must manipulate host cell biological processes towards its own ends, while avoiding elimination by the immune system. Protein-protein interactions between the virus and its host are one avenue through which dengue can connect and exploit these host cellular pathways and processes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We implemented a computational approach to predict interactions between Dengue virus (DENV) and both of its hosts, Homo sapiens and the insect vector Aedes aegypti. Our approach is based on structural similarity between DENV and host proteins and incorporates knowledge from the literature to further support a subset of the predictions. We predict over 4,000 interactions between DENV and humans, as well as 176 interactions between DENV and A. aegypti. Additional filtering based on shared Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of predictions to approximately 2,000 for humans and 18 for A. aegypti. Of 19 experimentally validated interactions between DENV and humans extracted from the literature, this method was able to predict nearly half (9). Additional predictions suggest specific interactions between virus and host proteins relevant to interferon signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress, and the unfolded protein response. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Dengue virus manipulates cellular processes to its advantage through specific interactions with the host's protein interaction network. The interaction networks presented here provide a set of hypothesis for further experimental investigation into the DENV life cycle as well as potential therapeutic targets.",4.446,1546

RNA-binding proteins are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation events. They are involved in a variety of functions such as splicing, alternative splicing, nuclear import and export of mRNA, RNA stability and translation. There are several well-characterized RNA-binding motifs present in a whole genome, such as RNA recognition motif (RRM), KH domain, zinc-fingers etc. In the present study, we have investigated human genome for the presence of RRM-containing gene products starting from RRM domains in the Pfam (Protein family database) repository. RESULTS: In Pfam, seven families are recorded to contain RRM-containing proteins. We studied these families for their taxonomic representation, sequence features (identity, length, phylogeny) and structural properties (mapping conservation on the structures). We then examined the presence of RRM-containing gene products in Homo sapiens genome and identified 928 RRM-containing gene products. These were studied for their predicted domain architectures, biological processes, involvement in pathways, disease relevance and disorder content. RRM domains were observed to occur multiple times in a single polypeptide. However, there are 56 other co-existing domains involved in different regulatory functions. Further, functional enrichment analysis revealed that RRM-containing gene products are mainly involved in biological functions such as mRNA splicing and its regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our sequence analysis identified RRM-containing gene products in the human genome and provides insights into their domain architectures and biological functions. Since mRNA splicing and gene regulation are important in the cellular machinery, this analysis provides an early overview of genes that carry out these functions.",3.986,868

At the same time, the transmission cycles of most mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g. viruses or filarial parasites) are not completely understood. There is especially a lack of knowledge about the vector capacity of the different mosquito species, which is strongly influenced by their host-feeding patterns. While this kind of information is important to identify the relevant vector species, e.g. to direct efficient control measures, studies about the host-feeding patterns of mosquito species in Germany are scarce and outdated. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 775 blood-fed mosquito specimens were collected. Sampling was conducted with Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey traps, Biogents Sentinel traps, gravid traps, hand-held aspirators, sweep nets, and human-bait collection. The host species for each mosquito specimen was identified with polymerase chain reactions and subsequent Sanger sequencing of the cytochrome b gene. RESULTS: A total of 32 host species were identified for 23 mosquito species, covering 21 mammalian species (including humans) and eleven bird species. Three mosquito species accounted for nearly three quarters of all collected blood-fed mosquitoes: Aedes vexans (363 specimens, 46.8 % of all mosquito specimens), Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (100, 12.9 %) and Ochlerotatus cantans (99, 12.8 %). Non-human mammals dominated the host species (572 specimens, 73.8 % of all mosquito specimens), followed by humans (152, 19.6 %) and birds (51, 6.6 %). The most common host species were roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; 258 mosquito specimens, 33.3 % of all mosquito specimens, 65 % of all mosquito species), humans (Homo sapiens; 152, 19.6 %, 90 %), cattle (Bos taurus; 101, 13.0 %, 60 %), and wild boar (Sus scrofa; 116, 15.0 %, 50 %). There were no statistically significant differences in the spatial-temporal host-feeding patterns of the three most common mosquito species. CONCLUSIONS: Although the collected blood-fed mosquito species had a strong overlap of host species, two different host-feeding groups were identified with mosquito species feeding on (i) non-human mammals and humans or (ii) birds, non-human mammals, and humans, which make them potential vectors of pathogens only between mammals or between mammals and birds, respectively. Due to the combination of their host-feeding patterns and wide distribution in Germany, Cx. pipiens pipiens form pipiens and Cx. torrentium are potentially most important vectors for pathogens transmitted from birds to humans and the species Ae. vexans for pathogens transmitted from non-human mammals to humans. Finally, the presented study indicated a much broader host range compared to the classifications found in the literature for some of the species, which highlights the need for studies on the host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes to further assess their vector capacity and the disease ecology in Europe.",3.43,571

Of some 170 causative mutations reported, fewer than 10% are observed in more than one geographic region or ethnic group. To better understand the population history of the common GALT mutations, we have established a haplotyping system for the GALT locus incorporating eight single nucleotide polymorphisms and three short tandem repeat markers. We analysed haplotypes associated with the three most frequent GALT gene mutations, Q188R, K285N and Duarte-2 (D2), and estimated their age. Haplotype diversity, in conjunction with measures of genetic diversity and of linkage disequilibrium, indicated that Q188R and K285N are European mutations. The Q188R mutation arose in central Europe within the last 20 000 years, with its observed east-west cline of increasing relative allele frequency possibly being due to population expansion during the re-colonization of Europe by Homo sapiens in the Mesolithic age. K285N was found to be a younger mutation that originated in Eastern Europe and is probably more geographically restricted as it arose after all major European population expansions. The D2 variant was found to be an ancient mutation that originated before the expansion of Homo sapiens out of Africa.",3.805,1604

 States of America",2009,"Approximately 700,000 years ago, Homo erectus in Africa was giving way to populations with larger brains accompanied by structural adjustments to the vault, cranial base, and face. Such early Middle Pleistocene hominins were not anatomically modern. Their skulls display strong supraorbital tori above projecting faces, flattened frontals, and less parietal expansion than is the case for Homo sapiens. Postcranial remains seem also to have archaic features. Subsequently, some groups evolved advanced skeletal morphology, and by ca. 200,000 years ago, individuals more similar to recent humans are present in the African record. These fossils are associated with Middle Stone Age lithic assemblages and, in some cases, Acheulean tools. Crania from Herto in Ethiopia carry defleshing cutmarks and superficial scoring that may be indicative of mortuary practices. Despite these signs of behavioral innovation, neither the Herto hominins, nor others from Late Pleistocene sites such as Klasies River in southern Africa and Skhul/Qafzeh in Israel, can be matched in living populations. Skulls are quite robust, and it is only after approximately 35,000 years ago that people with more gracile, fully modern morphology make their appearance. Not surprisingly, many questions concerning this evolutionary history have been raised. Attention has centered on systematics of the mid-Pleistocene hominins, their paleobiology, and the timing of dispersals that spread H. sapiens out of Africa and across the Old World. In this report, I discuss structural changes characterizing the skulls from different time periods, possible regional differences in morphology, and the bearing of this evidence on recognizing distinct species.",9.674,1800

26724853,Cross-organism learning method to discover new gene functionalities.,"['Domeniconi G', 'Masseroli M', 'Moro G', 'Pinoli P']",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2016,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of gene and protein functions is paramount for the understanding of physiological and pathological biological processes, as well as in the development of new drugs and therapies. Analyses for biomedical knowledge discovery greatly benefit from the availability of gene and protein functional feature descriptions expressed through controlled terminologies and ontologies, i.e., of gene and protein biomedical controlled annotations. In the last years, several databases of such annotations have become available; yet, these valuable annotations are incomplete, include errors and only some of them represent highly reliable human curated information. Computational techniques able to reliably predict new gene or protein annotations with an associated likelihood value are thus paramount. METHODS: Here, we propose a novel cross-organisms learning approach to reliably predict new functionalities for the genes of an organism based on the known controlled annotations of the genes of another, evolutionarily related and better studied, organism. We leverage a new representation of the annotation discovery problem and a random perturbation of the available controlled annotations to allow the application of supervised algorithms to predict with good accuracy unknown gene annotations. Taking advantage of the numerous gene annotations available for a well-studied organism, our cross-organisms learning method creates and trains better prediction models, which can then be applied to predict new gene annotations of a target organism. RESULTS: We tested and compared our method with the equivalent single organism approach on different gene annotation datasets of five evolutionarily related organisms (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, Gallus gallus and Dictyostelium discoideum). Results show both the usefulness of the perturbation method of available annotations for better prediction model training and a great improvement of the cross-organism models with respect to the single-organism ones, without influence of the evolutionary distance between the considered organisms. The generated ranked lists of reliably predicted annotations, which describe novel gene functionalities and have an associated likelihood value, are very valuable both to complement available annotations, for better coverage in biomedical knowledge discovery analyses, and to quicken the annotation curation process, by focusing it on the prioritized novel annotations predicted.",1.897,690

In order to overcome this lack of knowledge, we carried out a phylogeographic analysis of haplogroups A and B in a broad data set of sub-Saharan populations. These two lineages are particularly suitable for this objective because they are the two most deeply rooted branches of the Y chromosome genealogy. Their distribution is almost exclusively restricted to sub-Saharan Africa where their frequency peaks at 65% in groups of foragers. The combined high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism analysis with short tandem repeats variation of their subclades reveals strong geographic and population structure for both haplogroups. This has allowed us to identify specific lineages related to regional preagricultural dynamics in different areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we observed signatures of relatively recent contact, both among Pygmies and between them and Khoisan speaker groups from southern Africa, thus contributing to the understanding of the complex evolutionary relationships among African hunter-gatherers. Finally, by revising the phylogeography of the very early human Y chromosome lineages, we have obtained support for the role of southern Africa as a sink, rather than a source, of the first migrations of modern humans from eastern and central parts of the continent. These results open new perspectives on the early history of Homo sapiens in Africa, with particular attention to areas of the continent where human fossil remains and archaeological data are scant.",9.105,1469
24827671,Brief Communication: Quantitative- and molecular-genetic differentiation in humans and chimpanzees: implications for the evolutionary processes underlying cranial diversification.,['Weaver TD'],American journal of physical anthropology,2014,"Estimates of the amount of genetic differentiation in humans among major geographic regions (e.g., Eastern Asia vs. Europe) from quantitative-genetic analyses of cranial measurements closely match those from classical- and molecular-genetic markers. Typically, among-region differences account for  approximately 10% of the total variation. This correspondence is generally interpreted as evidence for the importance of neutral evolutionary processes (e.g., genetic drift) in generating among-region differences in human cranial form, but it was initially surprising because human cranial diversity was frequently assumed to show a strong signature of natural selection. Is the human degree of similarity of cranial and DNA-sequence estimates of among-region genetic differentiation unusual? How do comparisons with other taxa illuminate the evolutionary processes underlying cranial diversification? Chimpanzees provide a useful starting point for placing the human results in a broader comparative context, because common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are the extant species most closely related to humans. To address these questions, I used 27 cranial measurements collected on a sample of 861 humans and 263 chimpanzees to estimate the amount of genetic differentiation between pairs of groups (between regions for humans and between species or subspecies for chimpanzees). Consistent with previous results, the human cranial estimates are quite similar to published DNA-sequence estimates. In contrast, the chimpanzee cranial estimates are much smaller than published DNA-sequence estimates. It appears that cranial differentiation has been limited in chimpanzees relative to humans.",2.379,569

The mechanism of LASS2/TMSG1 inhibiting tumor invasion metastasis in breast cancer cells had not been well investigated. In the present study, a full length of 1.2 kb LASS2/TMSG1 complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for a protein of 380 amino acids was cloned. PcDNA3 eukaryotic expression plasmids of LASS2/TMSG1 were constructed and transfected into human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by lipofectin transfection method. And, the biological effects were observed comparing with control groups. As the result, LASS2/TMSG1 inhibited cell growth in vitro by increasing apoptosis and changing cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration were significantly decreased and the activity of secreted matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was downregulated in MCF-7 cells overexpressing LASS2/TMSG1 compared with the controls. Therefore, LASS2/TMSG1 may inhibit growth and invasion of breast cancer cell in vitro through decreasing V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and inactivating secreted MMP-2. The findings provided the evidence that the LASS2/TMSG1 gene had tumor growth and invasion suppressor function in human breast cancer cell and may provide a promising target for cancer metastasis diagnosis and therapy.",0,796

Here, using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. In addition, a painting of a babirusa ('pig-deer') made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one.

Because the tools to measure sleep under natural conditions were developed long after the invention of the electric devices suspected of delaying and reducing sleep, we investigated sleep in three preindustrial societies [1-3]. We find that all three show similar sleep organization, suggesting that they express core human sleep patterns, most likely characteristic of pre-modern era Homo sapiens. Sleep periods, the times from onset to offset, averaged 6.9-8.5 hr, with sleep durations of 5.7-7.1 hr, amounts near the low end of those industrial societies [4-7]. There was a difference of nearly 1 hr between summer and winter sleep. Daily variation in sleep duration was strongly linked to time of onset, rather than offset. None of these groups began sleep near sunset, onset occurring, on average, 3.3 hr after sunset. Awakening was usually before sunrise. The sleep period consistently occurred during the nighttime period of falling environmental temperature, was not interrupted by extended periods of waking, and terminated, with vasoconstriction, near the nadir of daily ambient temperature. The daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, may be a potent natural regulator of sleep. Light exposure was maximal in the morning and greatly decreased at noon, indicating that all three groups seek shade at midday and that light activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is maximal in the morning. Napping occurred on <7% of days in winter and <22% of days in summer. Mimicking aspects of the natural environment might be effective in treating certain modern sleep disorders.",0,736

Here, we investigated the organization of spectrin in a variety of neuronal- and glial-cell types. We observed the presence of MPS in all of the tested neuronal types cultured from mouse central and peripheral nervous systems, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons from several brain regions, as well as sensory and motor neurons. Quantitative analyses show that MPS is preferentially formed in axons in all neuronal types tested here: Spectrin shows a long-range, periodic distribution throughout all axons but appears periodic only in a small fraction of dendrites, typically in the form of isolated patches in subregions of these dendrites. As in dendrites, we also observed patches of periodic spectrin structures in a small fraction of glial-cell processes in four types of glial cells cultured from rodent tissues. Interestingly, despite its strong presence in the axonal shaft, MPS is disrupted in most presynaptic boutons but is present in an appreciable fraction of dendritic spine necks, including some projecting from dendrites where such a periodic structure is not observed in the shaft.

24968255,Interplay between chaperones and protein disorder promotes the evolution of protein networks.,"['Pechmann S', 'Frydman J']",PLoS computational biology,2014,"Evolution is driven by mutations, which lead to new protein functions but come at a cost to protein stability. Non-conservative substitutions are of interest in this regard because they may most profoundly affect both function and stability. Accordingly, organisms must balance the benefit of accepting advantageous substitutions with the possible cost of deleterious effects on protein folding and stability. We here examine factors that systematically promote non-conservative mutations at the proteome level. Intrinsically disordered regions in proteins play pivotal roles in protein interactions, but many questions regarding their evolution remain unanswered. Similarly, whether and how molecular chaperones, which have been shown to buffer destabilizing mutations in individual proteins, generally provide robustness during proteome evolution remains unclear. To this end, we introduce an evolutionary parameter lambda that directly estimates the rate of non-conservative substitutions. Our analysis of lambda in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens sequences reveals how co- and post-translationally acting chaperones differentially promote non-conservative substitutions in their substrates, likely through buffering of their destabilizing effects. We further find that lambda serves well to quantify the evolution of intrinsically disordered proteins even though the unstructured, thus generally variable regions in proteins are often flanked by very conserved sequences. Crucially, we show that both intrinsically disordered proteins and highly re-wired proteins in protein interaction networks, which have evolved new interactions and functions, exhibit a higher lambda at the expense of enhanced chaperone assistance. Our findings thus highlight an intricate interplay of molecular chaperones and protein disorder in the evolvability of protein networks. Our results illuminate the role of chaperones in enabling protein evolution, and underline the importance of the cellular context and integrated approaches for understanding proteome evolution. We feel that the development of lambda may be a valuable addition to the toolbox applied to understand the molecular basis of evolution.",4.62,941

The SH sample is used here, together with a sample of 39 complete Homo neanderthalensis long bones and 17 complete early Homo sapiens (Skhul/Qafzeh) long bones, to compare the stature of these three different human species. Stature is estimated for each bone using race- and sex-independent regression formulae, yielding an average stature for each bone within each taxon. The mean length of each long bone from SH is significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the corresponding mean values in the Neandertal sample. The stature has been calculated for male and female specimens separately, averaging both means to calculate a general mean. This general mean stature for the entire sample of long bones is 163.6 cm for the SH hominins, 160.6 cm for Neandertals and 177.4 cm for early modern humans. Despite some overlap in the ranges of variation, all mean values in the SH sample (whether considering isolated bones, the upper or lower limb, males or females or more complete individuals) are larger than those of Neandertals. Given the strong relationship between long bone length and stature, we conclude that SH hominins represent a slightly taller population or species than the Neandertals. However, compared with living European Mediterranean populations, neither the Sima de los Huesos hominins nor the Neandertals should be considered 'short' people. In fact, the average stature within the genus Homo seems to have changed little over the course of the last two million years, since the appearance of Homo ergaster in East Africa. It is only with the emergence of H. sapiens, whose earliest representatives were 'very tall', that a significant increase in stature can be documented.",3.733,930

In this article, the hypothesis that the Homo sapiens non-supranuchal fossa and the Neanderthal suprainiac fossa both formed to maintain the optimal shape of the occipital plane (to minimize strain on the posterior cranial vault) is tested. First, the variation in the expression of the fossa above inion in the crania of recent Homo sapiens from European, African, and Australian samples was examined, and the degree of structural similarity between these depressions and the Neanderthal suprainiac fossa was assessed. Next, the relationship between the shape of the occipital squama in the midsagittal plane and two particular features (the degree of the occipital torus development and the occurrence of a depression in the inion region that is not the supranuchal fossa) were analyzed.

Because DNA sequence homologies strongly suggest that P. troglodytes and Homo sapiens share a more recent common ancestor than either does with G. gorilla, we hypothesized that this phylogenetic relationship would be reflected in the suture closure patterns of these three taxa. Results indicated that while all three species do share a similar lateral-anterior closure pattern, G. gorilla exhibits a unique vault pattern, which, unlike humans and P. troglodytes, follows a strong posterior-to-anterior gradient.

Subsequently, all subjects were tested for transfer to the 2 untrained presentation modes. Humans outperformed pigeons regarding learning speed and accuracy as well as transfer performance and showed good learning irrespective of group assignment, whereas the pigeons of Group Blurred needed longer to learn the training tasks than the pigeons of Groups Intact and Scrambled. Also, whereas humans generalized equally well to any novel presentation mode, pigeons' transfer from and to blurred stimuli was impaired. Both species showed faster learning and, for the most part, better transfer in the rule-based than in the exemplar-based task, but there was no evidence of the used processing mode depending on the type of task (exemplar- or rule-based).

METHODS: Using cytogenetics and FISH analysis, we identified an apparently balanced t(6,22)(q16.2;p13) in a male patient with TS and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In order to map the breakpoints and to identify additional submicroscopic rearrangements, we performed whole genome mate-pair sequencing and CGH-array analysis on DNA from the proband. RESULTS: Sequence and CGH array analysis revealed a 400 kb deletion located 1.3 Mb telomeric of the chromosome 6q breakpoint, which has not been reported in controls. The deletion affects three genes (GPR63, NDUFA4 and KLHL32) and overlaps a region previously found deleted in a girl with autistic features and speech delay. The proband's mother, also a carrier of the translocation, was diagnosed with OCD and shares the deletion. We also describe a further potentially related rearrangement which, while unmapped in Homo sapiens, was consistent with the chimpanzee genome. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that genome-wide sequencing at relatively low resolution can be used for the identification of submicroscopic rearrangements. We also show that large rearrangements may escape detection using standard analysis of whole genome sequencing data.

It is noteworthy that Plasmodium falciparum contains only two members of the RecQ family as opposed to five members present in the host Homo sapiens. In the present study, we report the biochemical characterization of the homologue of Werner (Wrn) helicase from P. falciparum 3D7 strain. Although there are significant sequence conservations between Wrn helicases of both H. sapiens and P. falciparum as well as among all the other Plasmodium species, they contain some peculiar differences also. In silico studies reveal that PfWrn is evolutionarily close to the bacterial RecQ protein. The N-terminal fragment (PfWrnN) contains all the helicase motifs along with all the functional domains and the predicted structure resembles with the human RecQ1 protein, whereas the C-terminal fragment (PfWrnC) contains no significant domain. Biochemical characterization further revealed that purified recombinant PfWrnN shows ATPase and DNA helicase activity in 3' to 5' direction, but PfWrnC lacks the ATPase and helicase activities. Immunofluorescence study shows that PfWrn is expressed in all the stages of intraerythrocytic development of the P. falciparum 3D7 strain and localizes distinctly in the nucleus.

This model suggests a major cultural change, during the Palaeolithic, from hunters to warriors. Moreover, in the light of the recent Out of Africa Theory, it suggests that the",0,1097
22394472,Evolutionary aspects of human exercise--born to run purposefully.,['Mattson MP'],Ageing research reviews,2012,"This article is intended to raise awareness of the adaptive value of endurance exercise (particularly running) in the evolutionary history of humans, and the implications of the genetic disposition to exercise for the aging populations of modern technology-driven societies. The genome of Homo sapiens has evolved to support the svelte phenotype of an endurance runner, setting him/her apart from all other primates. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the competitive advantages conferred by exercise capacity in youth can also provide a survival benefit beyond the reproductive period. These mechanisms include up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress, disposing of damaged proteins and organelles, and enhancing bioenergetics. Particularly fascinating are the signaling mechanisms by which endurance running changes the structure and functional capabilities of the brain and, conversely, the mechanisms by which the brain integrates metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral responses to exercise. As an emerging example, I highlight the roles of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a mediator of the effects of exercise on the brain, and BDNF's critical role in regulating metabolic and cardiovascular responses to endurance running. A better understanding of such 'healthspan-extending' actions of endurance exercise may lead to new approaches for improving quality of life as we advance in the coming decades and centuries.",4.94,1278

The vocalizations and accompanying behavior of 5 human infants videorecorded monthly at the transition to speech were analyzed to determine the frequency, physiological basis, and functional status of grunt production, a phenomenon systematically studied for the first time here. Earliest grunts occurred accompanying movement or effort; next, they accompanied acts of focal attention; and finally they were used in communication. Communicative use was followed by the onset of referential ability in language. This sequence is interpreted in relation to the physiological basis of these vocalizations in respiratory function and to additional developmental variables observed in the children.

The 24 h light/dark cycle is the prime synchronizer of circadian periodicities, and its modulation over the course of the year, in terms of daytime photoperiod length, is a prime synchronizer of circannual periodicities. Circadian and circannual rhythms have been the major research focus of most scientists. Circa-monthly rhythms triggered or synchronized by the 29.5 day lunar cycle of nighttime light intensity, or specifically the light of the full moon, although explored in waterborne and certain other species, have received far less study, perhaps because of associations with ancient mythology and/or an attitude naturalistic studies are of lesser merit than ones that entail molecular mechanisms. In this editorial, we cite our recent discovery through multidisciplinary naturalistic investigation of a highly integrated circadian, circa-monthly, and circannual time structure, synchronized by the natural ambient nyctohemeral, lunar, and annual light cycles, of the Peruvian apple cactus (C. peruvianus) flowering and reproductive processes that occur in close temporal coordination with like rhythms of the honey bee as its pollinator. This finding led us to explore the preservation of this integrated biological time structure, synchronized and/or triggered by environmental light cues and cycles, in the reproduction of other species, including Homo sapiens, and how the artificial light environment of today in which humans reside may be negatively affecting human reproduction efficiency.",3.343,700

 Toxinology",2012,"The evolutionary pathway of highly toxic proteins expressed in snake venom glands from proteins without toxic function and expressed in non-parotid tissues remains poorly understood. Here we examine gene structure of a representative of a venom protein with an ADAMs metalloproteinase evolutionary origin. The structure of the 15,652 bp Echis ocellatus pre-pro EOC00089-like PIII-SVMP gene was assembled from PCR-amplified sequences of overlapping genomic fragments. The gene comprises 12 exons interrupted by 11 introns. In a homology model of the EOC00089-like protein, the insertion of introns interrupting coding regions lie just after or between secondary structure elements. Long interspersed nuclear retroelements (LINE) L2/CR1 and RTE/Bov-B, short interspersed nuclear retroelements SINE/Sauria, and a hobo-activator DNA (Charlie, hAT) transposon were identified within introns 1, 3, 7 and 8. Pairwise amino acid sequence comparisons between EOC00089-like PIII-SVMP and its closest orthologs, ADAM28, from a mammal, Homo sapiens, and the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, showed that the ORFs of these three proteins share 42%/59%, 49%/69%, and 48%/65% (identity/similarity), respectively. The protein-coding positions interrupted by each of the 11 introns of the Echis PIII-SVMP gene are entirely conserved in the A. carolinensis and human ADAM28 genes. However, the lizard and the human ADAM28 genes contain 5 introns not present in the E. ocellatus gene. Furthermore, Echis and Anolis introns exhibit quantitatively and qualitatively distinctions in their inserted retroelements. These findings identify introns as possible key elements in the recruitment and amplification process of SVMPs into the venom gland of extant snakes. Ongoing reptile genome sequencing projects may shed light on this intriguing aspect of the emergence and evolution of venom toxin genes. Furthermore, the organization of the PIII-SVMP reported here provides a genomic explanation for the emergence of dimeric disintegrin subunits encoded by short messengers.",0,1310

In this paper, we define a measure of modularity for interactomes and present a linear-time algorithm, Produles, for detecting multiprotein modularity conserved during evolution that improves on the running time of previous algorithms for related problems and offers desirable theoretical guarantees. We present a biologically motivated graph theoretic set of evaluation measures complementary to previous evaluation measures, demonstrate that Produles exhibits good performance by all measures, and describe certain recurrent anomalies in the performance of previous algorithms that are not detected by previous measures. Consideration of the newly defined measures and algorithm performance on these measures leads to useful insights on the nature of interactomics data and the goals of previous and current algorithms. Through randomization experiments, we demonstrate that conserved modularity is a defining characteristic of interactomes. Computational experiments on current experimentally derived interactomes for Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, combining results across algorithms, show that nearly 10 percent of current interactome proteins participate in multiprotein modules with good evidence in the protein interaction data of being conserved between human and Drosophila.",1.811,1288

However, experimental identification of PPIs is a laborious and error-prone process, and current methods of PPI prediction tend to be highly conservative or require large amounts of functional data that may not be available for newly-sequenced organisms. RESULTS: In this study we demonstrate a random-forest based technique, ENTS, for the computational prediction of protein-protein interactions based only on primary sequence data. Our approach is able to efficiently predict interactions on a whole-genome scale for any eukaryotic organism, using pairwise combinations of conserved domains and predicted subcellular localization of proteins as input features. We present the first predicted interactome for the forest tree Populus trichocarpa in addition to the predicted interactomes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Comparing our approach to other PPI predictors, we find that ENTS performs comparably to or better than a number of existing approaches, including several that utilize a variety of functional information for their predictions. We also find that the predicted interactions are biologically meaningful, as indicated by similarity in functional annotations and enrichment of co-expressed genes in public microarray datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate some of the biological insights that can be gained from these predicted interaction networks. We show that the predicted interactions yield informative groupings of P. trichocarpa metabolic pathways, literature-supported associations among human disease states, and theory-supported insight into the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes in paleopolyploid plants. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the ENTS classifier will be a valuable tool for the de novo annotation of genome sequences, providing initial clues about regulatory and metabolic network topology, and revealing relationships that are not immediately obvious from traditional homology-based annotations.",3.986,1064

RESULTS: Here, we present miRTrail, an integrative tool that allows for performing comprehensive analyses of interactions of genes and miRNAs based on expression profiles. The integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA data should generate more robust and reliable results on deregulated pathogenic processes and may also offer novel insights into the regulatory interactions between miRNAs and genes. Our web-server excels in carrying out gene sets analysis, analysis of miRNA sets as well as the combination of both in a systems biology approach. To this end, miRTrail integrates information on 20.000 genes, almost 1.000 miRNAs, and roughly 280.000 putative interactions, for Homo sapiens and accordingly for Mus musculus and Danio rerio.

A total of 10,447 non-synonymous substitutions were found in which the derived allele is fixed or nearly fixed in humans as compared to chimpanzee. Their most frequent location was on chromosome 21. Their presence was then searched in the two archaic genomes. Mutations in 381 genes would imply radical amino acid changes, with a fraction of these related to olfaction and other important physiological processes. Eight new alleles were identified in the Neanderthal and/or Denisova genetic pools. Four others, possibly affecting cognition, occured both in the sapiens and two other archaic genomes.

It has been reported that RNA secondary structures are involved in alternative splicing. Here we perform a genomic study of RNA secondary structures around splice sites in humans (Homo sapiens), mice (Mus musculus), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) to further investigate this phenomenon. RESULTS: We observe that GC content around splice sites is closely associated with the splice site usage in multiple species. RNA secondary structure is the possible explanation, because the structural stability difference among alternative splice sites, constitutive splice sites, and skipped splice sites can be explained by the GC content difference. Alternative splice sites tend to be GC-enriched and exhibit more stable RNA secondary structures in all of the considered species. In humans and mice, splice sites of first exons and long exons tend to be GC-enriched and hence form more stable structures, indicating the special role of RNA secondary structures in promoter proximal splicing events and the splicing of long exons. In addition, GC-enriched exon-intron junctions tend to be overrepresented in tissue-specific alternative splice sites, indicating the functional consequence of the GC effect. Compared with regions far from splice sites and decoy splice sites, real splice sites are GC-enriched. We also found that the GC-content effect is much stronger than the nucleotide-order effect to form stable secondary structures. CONCLUSION: All of these results indicate that GC content is related to splice site usage and it may mediate the splicing process through RNA secondary structures.",3.986,1560

Solubilized erythrocyte membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), visualized by staining the gels with Commassie Brilliant Blue (CBB), and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Emerging results show that all major erythrocyte membrane proteins present in human are also seen in all the animals except for band 4.5 which could not be identified. Band 3 is seen as more intense and compact, band 4.1 appears as a doublet in all the animal erythrocyte membranes, band 4.2 exhibits a slightly higher molecular weight (Mr) in buffalo, and cow and band 4.9 has a higher Mr in all the animals relative to the human protein. In addition, there are two new bands in the goat membrane, band G1, identified as HSP 90alpha, and band G2 identified as HSP 70. A new band C2 identified as HSP 70 is also seen in cow membranes. Peroxiredoxin II is of lower intensity and/or higher Mr in the animals. The difference in size of the proteins possibly indicates the variations in the composition of the amino acids. The difference in intensity of the proteins among these mammalians highlights the presence of less or more number of copies of that protein per cell. This data complement the earlier observations of differences in the sialoglycoprotein profile and effect of proteases and neuraminidase on agglutination among the mammalian erythrocytes. This study provides a platform to understand the molecular architecture of the individual erythrocytes, and in turn the dependent disorders, their phylogenetic relationship and also generates a database of erythrocyte membrane proteins of mammals. The animals selected for this study are of economic importance as they provide milk for the dairy industry and raw material for leather industry and are routinely sacrificed to obtain non vegetarian food worldwide.",0,882

Alignment of the Piwi proteins showed the high identity between Sus scrofa and Homo sapiens. Relative transcript abundance of porcine Piwil1, Piwil2 and Piwil4 genes in testes, ovaries and oocytes derived from sexually immature and mature animals was examined using Real-Time PCR. Expression of the three Piwi mRNAs was proved to be tissue specific and restricted exclusively to the gonads. In testes of adult pigs the highest relative transcript abundance was observed for the Sus scrofa Piwil1 gene. On the other hand, in testes of neonatal pigs the Piwil1 transcript level was over 2-fold reduced while the level of Piwil2 transcript was higher. As regards the expression of the Piwil4 transcript, its level was 34-fold elevated in testes of neonatal piglet when compared to adult male. In ovaries of prepubertal and pubertal female pigs transcript abundance of the three Piwi genes was significantly reduced in comparison with testes. However, similarly to testes, in ovaries of neonatal pigs the Piwil2 gene was characterized by the highest relative transcript abundance among the three Piwi genes analysed.

METHODS: The authors genotyped 4 common polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs: Homo sapiens miRNA 146a (hsa-mir-146a) (reference SNP 2910164 [rs2910164]; guanine to cytosine [G-->C]), hsa-mir-149 (rs2292832; guanine to thymine [G-->T]), hsa-mir-196a2 (rs11614913; C-->T), and hsa-mir-499 (rs3746444; adenine to guanine [A-->G]) in 1109 patients with SCCHN (cases) and in 1130 cancer-free patients (controls) in a non-Hispanic white population that was frequency-matched by age and sex. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Of the 4 SNPs that were studied, the hsa-mir-499 AG and GG genotypes were associated with a reduced risk of SCCHN (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99). When the 4 SNPs were combined according to putative risk genotype, the number of observed risk genotypes was associated with an increased risk of SCCHN in a dose-response manner with ORs of 1.0, 1.20, and 1.40 for individuals who had 0 or 1 risk genotypes, 2 or 3 risk genotypes, and 4 risk genotypes, respectively (P(trend) = .037).

Despite the accumulated knowledge, modulation of wound healing is still a major biomedical challenge, especially in advanced ages. In order to collect and systematically organize what we know about the key players in wound healing, we created the TiRe (Tissue Repair) database, an online collection of genes and proteins that were shown to directly affect skin wound healing. To date, TiRe contains 397 entries for four organisms: Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Sus domesticus, and Homo sapiens. Analysis of the TiRe dataset of skin wound healing-associated genes showed that skin wound healing genes are (i) over-conserved among vertebrates, but are under-conserved in invertebrates; (ii) enriched in extracellular and immuno-inflammatory genes; and display (iii) high interconnectivity and connectivity to other proteins. The latter may provide potential therapeutic targets. In addition, a slower or faster skin wound healing is indicative of an aging or longevity phenotype only when assessed in advanced ages, but not in the young.

In addition to morphological and cultural changes, also metabolic ones are supposed to have favored human isolation from cold and body heat production and this can be hypothesized also for most Neandertal and at least for some Denisovan populations, which lived in geographical areas that strongly experienced the last glacial period. Modulation of non-shivering thermogenesis, for which adipocytes belonging to the brown adipose tissue are the most specialized cells, might have driven these metabolic adaptations. To perform an exploratory analysis aimed at looking into this hypothesis, variation at 28 genes involved in such functional pathway was investigated in modern populations from different climate zones, as well as in Neandertal and Denisovan genomes. Patterns of variation at the LEPR gene, strongly related to increased heat dissipation by mitochondria, appeared to have been shaped by positive selection in modern East Asians, but not in Europeans. Moreover, a single potentially cold-adapted LEPR allele, different from the supposed adaptive one identified in Homo sapiens, was found also in Neandertal and Denisovan genomes.

In order to solve this difficult problem, an International Consortium comprising genomists and psycho-biologists from the G-8 countries has been created. In a first step it was decided to concentrate on extreme opposite phenotypes manifesting in Homo sapiens sapiens: the hyper-altruism syndrome (HAS) and the hyper-selfishness syndrome (HSS). Conventional association methods, using the most powerful tools provided by the SNR, and the HumMap projects, resulted in the preliminary mapping of the ''altruist'' locus, and the ''selfish'' locus, both in the pseudo-autosomal region of the short arm of chromosome X. Transcriptional studies using 1000K chips showed that an unannotated sequence was overexpressed in HAS and underexpressed in HSS individuals. This mirror pattern of expression suggested that the two deviant states might be allelic. This hypothesis was substantiated by genome studies using GGH-array. Ultimately different mutations in expressed genomic sequences showed a striking genotype-phenotype correlation: gain-of-function (GOF) mutations were invariably found in the HAS group, whereas loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were invariably found in the HSS group. These results demonstrate that a same and unique novel gene, coined DARWIN, is involved in the two opposite deviant phenotypes, suggesting that the morbid locus is a GTL (quantitative trait locus). Preliminary comparative data obtained in non-human primates showed that the DARWIN gene is highly conserved. Like humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have a single expressed gene copy located in a stable genomic domain, whereas the highly benevolent bonobo primate (Pan paniscus) has several expressed gene copies, located in a copy number variable region (CNVR), a situation that buffers phenotypic manifestation of LOF mutations.",0,1892

Functional characterization of these genomes, such as by high-throughput proteomics, is an important but challenging task due to the difficulty of scaling up existing experimental techniques. By use of comparative genomics techniques, experimental results can be transferred from one genome to another, while at the same time minimizing errors by requiring discovery in multiple genomes. In this study, protein phosphorylation, an essential component of many cellular processes, is studied using data from large-scale proteomics analyses of the phosphoproteome. Phosphorylation sites from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster phosphopeptide data sets were mapped onto conserved domains in NCBI's manually curated portion of Conserved Domain Database (CDD). In this subset, 25 phosphorylation sites are found to be evolutionarily conserved between the three species studied. Transfer of phosphorylation annotation of these conserved sites onto sequences sharing the same conserved domains yield 3253 phosphosite annotations for proteins from coelomata, the taxonomic division that spans H. sapiens, M. musculus and D. melanogaster. The method scales automatically, so as the amount of experimental phosphoproteomics data increases, more conserved phosphorylation sites may be revealed.",3.372,1466

However, most of the research on this topic focused on permanent teeth, and little information is available for the deciduous dentition. Moreover, although worn teeth are more frequently found than unworn teeth, published data for worn teeth are scarce and methods for the assessment of their enamel thickness need to be developed. Here, we addressed this issue by studying the 2D average enamel thickness (AET) and 2D relative enamel thickness (RET) of Neanderthal and modern humans unworn to moderately worn upper first deciduous molars (dm(1)s) and upper second deciduous molars (dm(2)s). In particular, we used 3D muCT data to investigate the mesial section for dm(1)s and both mesial and buccal sections for dm(2)s. Our results confirmed previous findings of an Neanderthal derived condition of thin enamel, and thinner enamel in dm(1)s than dm(2)s in both Neanderthal and modern humans. We demonstrated that the Neanderthal 2D RET indices are significantly lower than those of modern humans at similar wear stages in both dm(1)s and dm(2)s (p < 0.05). The discriminant analysis showed that using 2D RET from dm(1) and dm(2) sections at different wear stages up to 93% of the individuals are correctly classified. Moreover, we showed that the dm(2) buccal sections, although non-conventionally used, might have an advantage on mesial sections since they distinguish as well as mesial sections but tend to be less worn. Therefore, the 2D analysis of enamel thickness is suggested as a means for taxonomic discrimination between modern humans and Neanderthal unworn to moderately worn upper deciduous molars.",3.733,437

To date, the function of KIF3B and its relationship with KIF3A during spermiogenesis in the cephalopod Octopus tankahkeei remains unknown. In the present study, we characterized a gene encoding a homologue of rat KIF3B in the O. tankahkeei testis and examined its temporal and spatial expression pattern during spermiogenesis. The cDNA of KIF3B was obtained with degenerate and RACE PCR and the distribution pattern of ot-kif3b were observed with RT-PCR. The morphological development during spermiogenesis was illustrated by histological and transmission electron microscopy and mRNA expression of ot-kif3b was observed by in situ hybridization. The 2,365 nucleotides cDNA consisted of a 102 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 2,208 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 736 amino acids, and a 55 bp 3' UTR. Multiple alignments revealed that the putative Ot-KIF3B shared 68, 68, 69, 68, and 67% identity with that of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio, and Xenopus laevis, respectively, along with high identities with Ot-KIF3A in fundamental structures. Ot-kif3b transcripts appeared gradually in early spermatids, increased in intermediate spermatids and maximized in drastically remodeled and final spermatids. The kif3b gene is identified and its expression pattern is demonstrated for the first time in O. tankahkeei. Compared to ot-kif3a reported by our laboratory before, our data suggested that the putative heterodimeric motor proteins Ot-KIF3A/B may be involved in intraspermatic transport and might contribute to structural changes during spermiogenesis.",2.024,1375

Through the use of phylogenetic tools, this present study attempts to elucidate the evolutionary history of the alpha-CA superfamily, with particular interest in the emerging model aquatic organism Daphnia pulex. We provide one of the most extensive phylogenies of the evolution of alpha-CAs, with the inclusion of 261 amino acid sequences across taxa ranging from Cnidarians to Homo sapiens. While the phylogeny supports most of our previous understanding on the relationship of how alpha-CAs have evolved, we find that, contrary to expectations, amino acid conservation with bacterial alpha-CAs supports the supposition that extracellular alpha-CAs are the ancestral state of animal alpha-CAs. Furthermore, we show that two cytosolic and one GPI-anchored alpha-CA in Daphnia genus have homologs in sister taxa that are possible candidate genes to study for acid-base regulation. In addition, we provide further support for previous findings of a high rate of gene duplication within Daphnia genus, as compared with other organisms.",3.313,912

The ascertainment bias of physicians to discover strong phenotypic effects ('non-leaky' mutations) obscures the fact that, for many such instances, there exist numerous other alleles of lesser effects, including those whose gene actions probably escape the force of natural selection. The patterns of 'normal' aging in Homo sapiens are quite variable and, hence, difficult to define. It seems likely that the 'wild-type' alleles of a number of loci will also be found to have antagonistic pleiotropic effects that contribute to the syndromology of senescence in our species.",1.4,281

Upper second and third molars have been studied in a comprehensive sample of Plio- and Pleistocene hominins from African, Asian and European sites in order to complete our analysis of the upper postcanine dentition. Intraspecific variation in these two molars is high, but some interspecific trends can be identified. Both molars exhibit a strong reduction of the distal cusps in recent hominin species, namely European Homo heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens, but this reduction shows specific patterns and proportions in the three groups. Second molars tend to show four well developed cusps in earlier hominin species and their morphology is only marginally affected by allometric effects. Third molars can be incipiently reduced in earlier species and they evince a significant allometric component, identified both inter- and intraspecifically. European Middle Pleistocene fossils from Sima de los Huesos (SH) show a very strong reduction of these two molars, even more marked than the reduction observed in Neanderthals and in modern human populations. The highly derived shape of SH molars points to an early acquisition of typical Neanderthal dental traits by pre-Neanderthal populations and to a deviation of this population from mean morphologies of other European Middle Pleistocene groups.",3.733,1150

Precise execution of the stages of spermatogenesis results in the production of motile sperm. While comparative analyses have been used to identify similarities and differences in spermatogenesis between species, the focus has primarily been on vertebrate spermatogenesis, particularly mammals. To understand the evolutionary basis of spermatogenetic variation, however, a more comprehensive comparison is needed.

Intentional cranial vault deformation in human populations provides a controlled natural experiment by which we were able to quantify aspects of sutural complexity and examine the relationship between sutural patterns and mechanical loading. Measures of sutural complexity (interdigitation, number, and size of sutural bones) were quantified from digitized tracings of 13 sutures and compared among three groups of crania (n = 70) from pre-European contact Peru. These groups represent sample populations deformed in 1) anteroposterior (AP) and 2) circumferential (C) directions and 3) an undeformed population. Intergroup comparisons show few differences in degree or asymmetry of sutural interdigitation. In the few comparisons which show differences, the C group is always more interdigitated than the other two while the AP group has more sutural bones. The sutures surrounding the temporal bone (sphenotemporal, occipitotemporal, and temporoparietal) most frequently show significant differences among groups. These differences are related to the more extreme binding of C type deformation and are consistent with hypothesized increases in tension at coronally oriented sutures in this group. The larger number of sutural bones in the AP group is consistent with the general broadening of the cranium in this group and with experimental evidence indicating the development of ossicles in areas of tension. We suggest that so few changes in sutural complexity occurred either because the magnitude of the growth vectors, unlike their direction, is not substantially altered or because mechanisms other than sutural growth modification are responsible for producing the altered vault shapes. In addition, the presence of fontanelles in the infant skulls during binding and the static nature of the binding may have contributed to the similarity in complexity among groups.",1.735,502

New antimalarial treatments are needed to face existing or emerging drug resistant strains. Protein degradation appears to play a significant role during the asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) of P. falciparum. Inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), a major intracellular proteolytic pathway, effectively reduces infection and parasite replication. P. falciparum and erythrocyte UPS coexist during IDC but the nature of their relationship is largely unknown. We used an approach based on Tandem Ubiquitin-Binding Entities (TUBEs) and 1D gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry to identify major components of the TUBEs-associated ubiquitin proteome of both host and parasite during ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Ring-exported protein (REX1), a P. falciparum protein located in Maurer's clefts and important for parasite nutrient import, was found to reach a maximum level of ubiquitylation in trophozoites stage. The Homo sapiens (H. sapiens) TUBEs associated ubiquitin proteome decreased during the infection, whereas the equivalent P. falciparum TUBEs-associated ubiquitin proteome counterpart increased. Major cellular processes such as DNA repair, replication, stress response, vesicular transport and catabolic events appear to be regulated by ubiquitylation along the IDC P. falciparum infection. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this work we analyze for the first time the interconnection between Plasmodium and human red blood cells ubiquitin-regulated proteins in the context of infection. We identified a number of human and Plasmodium proteins whose ubiquitylation pattern changes during the asexual infective stage. We demonstrate that ubiquitylation of REX1, a P. falciparum protein located in Maurer's clefts and important for parasite nutrient import, peaks in trophozoites stage. The ubiquitin-proteome from P. falciparum infected red blood cells (iRBCs) revealed a significant host-parasite crosstalk, underlining the importance of ubiquitin-regulated proteolytic activities during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) of P. falciparum. Major cellular processes defined from gene ontology such as DNA repair, replication, stress response, vesicular transport and catabolic events appear to be regulated by ubiquitylation along the IDC P. falciparum infection. Given the importance of ubiquitylation in the development of infectious diseases, this work provides a number of potential drug-target candidates that should be further explored.",3.888,565

 of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",2015,"As most newly characterized emerging infectious diseases are considered to be zoonotic, a modern pre-eminence ascribed within this classification lies clearly within the viral taxonomic realm. In particular, RNA viruses deserve special concern given their documented impact on conservation biology, veterinary medicine and public health, with an unprecedented ability to promote an evolutionary host-pathogen arms race from the ultimate infection and immunity perspective. However, besides the requisite molecular/gross anatomical and physiological bases for infectious diseases to transmit from one host to another, both viral pathogens and their reservoirs/vectors exploit a complex anthropological, cultural, historical, psychological and social suite that specifically defines the phylodynamics within Homo sapiens, unlike any other species. Some of these variables include the ecological benefits of living in groups, decisions on hunting and foraging behaviours and dietary preferences, myths and religious doctrines, health economics, travel destinations, population planning, political decisions on agricultural product bans and many others, in a homo-sociome memetic complex. Taken to an extreme, such complexities elucidate the underpinnings of explanations as to why certain viral zoonoses reside in neglected people, places and things, whereas others are chosen selectively and prioritized for active mitigation. Canine-transmitted rabies serves as one prime example of how a neglected viral zoonosis may transition to greater attention on the basis of renewed advocacy, social media, local champions and vested international community engagement. In contrast, certain bat-associated and arboviral diseases suffer from basic ignorance and perpetuated misunderstanding of fundamental reservoir and vector ecology tenets, translated into failed control policies that only exacerbate the underlying environmental conditions of concern. Beyond applied biomedical knowledge, epidemiological skills and biotechnical abilities alone, if a homo-sociome memetic complex approach is also entertained in a modern transdisciplinary context, neglected viral zoonosis may be better understood, controlled, prevented and possibly eliminated, in a more holistic One Health context.",5.768,170

Out of five targets analyzed, D-alanine:D-alanine ligase was found to be the most promising target, while terpenoid salvicine was the most potent inhibitor. A comparison of the inhibitory potential of the best docked readily available natural compound, namely pomiferin (flavonoid) with that of the best docked terpenoid salvicine, revealed that salvicine was a more potent inhibitor than that of pomiferin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a terpenoid as a potential therapeutic molecule against T. pallidum with D-alanine:D-alanine ligase as a novel target. Further studies are warranted to evaluate and explore the potential clinical ramifications of these findings in relation to syphilis that has public health importance worldwide.",2.362,819

The teeth were scanned by means of microtomography. The roots were divided into three virtual segments by three planes: cemento-enamel junction (CEJ), mid-root (MR), and mid-apex (MA). Volumetric and planar direct measurements of the whole teeth and each segment were taken. Descriptive statistical analyses and nonparametric Mann-Whiney test were performed to test for significant differences (P < 0.025) between groups. ATE9-1 and Gran Dolina-TD6 fossils present intricate radicular complexes that might be transitional between the morphologies of Australopithecus robustus and African early Homo and the derived conditions typically found in later Homo. In H. neanderthalensis and H. heidelbergensis, the root canals are wide, with small apical convergence. This trait is particularly pronounced in the Sima de los Huesos sample which may reflect a particularity of this population. Our study demonstrates the potential of hominin roots and root canals as untapped sources of taxonomic information when the tooth crown is fragmented. Future studies, including more fossil specimens and species will shed light in the polarity of the morphologies observed.",2.379,1563

METHODS: The ROP18 gene fragments were amplified by RT-PCR from mRNA of T. gondii RH strain. The product of RT-PCR was digested with double restriction enzyme and was subcloned into the bait vector pGBKT7. The recombinant plasmid was transferred into yeast AH109 strain. Its toxicity and the autonomous activating activity were tested. The human fetal brain cDNA library was screened with pGBKT7-ROP18(25-251aa) as the bait plasmid by yeast two-hybrid system. RESULTS: The bait was constructed and AH109/PGBKT7-ROP18 showed an autonomous activity. The yeast strain AH109/pGBKT7-ROP18(25-251aa) line was then mated with the Mate & PlateTM Human Fetal Brain cDNA library. Using the selection procedures, eight novel host cell proteins were obtained: damage-specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), torsin A interacting protein 1 (TOR1AIP1), integrin beta 1, solute carrier family 3 (SLC3A2), tyrosyl protein sulfotransferase (TPST2), OCIA domain containing 1 (OCIAD1), Derl-like domain family member 2 (DERL2), in addition to Homo sapiens activating transcription factor 6 beta(ATF6).

Although most COQ proteins are known to catalyze modifications to CoQ precursors, the biochemical role of COQ9 remains unclear. Here, we report that a disease-related COQ9 mutation leads to extensive disruption of the CoQ protein biosynthetic complex in a mouse model, and that COQ9 specifically interacts with COQ7 through a series of conserved residues. Toward understanding how COQ9 can perform these functions, we solved the crystal structure of Homo sapiens COQ9 at 2.4 A. Unexpectedly, our structure reveals that COQ9 has structural homology to the TFR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators, but that it adopts an atypical TFR dimer orientation and is not predicted to bind DNA. Our structure also reveals a lipid-binding site, and mass spectrometry-based analyses of purified COQ9 demonstrate that it associates with multiple lipid species, including CoQ itself. The conserved COQ9 residues necessary for its interaction with COQ7 comprise a surface patch around the lipid-binding site, suggesting that COQ9 might serve to present its bound lipid to COQ7. Collectively, our data define COQ9 as the first, to our knowledge, mammalian TFR structural homolog and suggest that its lipid-binding capacity and association with COQ7 are key features for enabling CoQ biosynthesis.",9.674,881

Yet fossils alone do not provide clear answers to the question of whether the ancestors of all modern Homo sapiens comprised a single African population or an amalgamation of distinct archaic populations. DNA sequence data have consistently supported a single-origin model in which anatomically modern Africans expanded and completely replaced all other archaic hominin populations. Aided by a novel experimental design, we present the first genetic evidence that statistically rejects the null hypothesis that our species descends from a single, historically panmictic population. In a global sample of 42 X chromosomes, two African individuals carry a lineage of noncoding 17.5-kb sequence that has survived for >1 million years without any clear traces of ongoing recombination with other lineages at this locus. These patterns of deep haplotype divergence and long-range linkage disequilibrium are best explained by a prolonged period of ancestral population subdivision followed by relatively recent interbreeding. This inference supports human evolution models that incorporate admixture between divergent African branches of the genus Homo.",5.963,1874

However, genome scaffolding and closure require costly human supervision that often results in genomes being published as drafts. A number of automatic scaffolders were recently released, which improved the global quality of genomes published in the last few years. Yet, none of them reach the efficiency of manual scaffolding. RESULTS: Here, we present an innovative semi-automatic scaffolder that additionally helps with chimerae resolution and generates valuable contig maps and outputs for manual improvement of the automatic scaffolding. This software was tested on the newly sequenced marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH8103 as well as two reference datasets used in previous studies, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Homo sapiens chromosome 14 (http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/). The quality of resulting scaffolds was compared to that of three other stand-alone scaffolders: SSPACE, SOPRA and SCARPA. For all three model organisms, WiseScaffolder produced better results than other scaffolders in terms of contiguity statistics (number of genome fragments, N50, LG50, etc.) and, in the case of WH8103, the reliability of the scaffolds was confirmed by whole genome alignment against a closely related reference genome. We also propose an efficient computer-assisted strategy for manual improvement of the scaffolding, using outputs generated by WiseScaffolder, as well as for genome finishing that in our hands led to the circularization of the WH8103 genome. CONCLUSION: Altogether, WiseScaffolder proved more efficient than three other scaffolders for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and is thus likely applicable to most genome projects. The scaffolding pipeline described here should be of particular interest to biologists wishing to take advantage of the high added value of complete genomes.",2.576,714

In subsequent years the interpretation of this fossil remained difficult for various reasons: (1) the lack of taxonomically diagnostic elements which would support its attribution to either Homo (sapiens) neanderthalensis or H. s. sapiens; (2) the absence of any reliable chronostratigraphic interpretation of the sedimentary sequence of the site; (3) the contradiction between archaeological interpretations, which attributed the lithic industry to a transitional facies between the Middle and Early Upper Palaeolithic, and the radiocarbon date of 46,820+/-3,290BP obtained from animal bone remains associated with the tooth and the flint tools. Thanks to recent progress regarding these three aspects, the tooth from Trou de l'Abime may now be studied in detail. Analyses of the morphology and enamel thickness of the fossil yielded diagnostic characters consistent with an attribution to Neandertals. Re-examination of the lithic industry of Couvin shows that it corresponds to the late Middle Palaeolithic rather than a transitional facies. Furthermore, a new analysis of the site stratigraphy indicates that the unit situated above the archaeological layer in which the tooth was found is probably a palaeosol of brown soil type. Comparison with the regional cave sequences as well as with the reference sequence from the Belgian loess belt tends to show that the most recent palaeosol of this type is dated between 42,000 and 40,000BP.

Though some studies conclude that early Homo sapiens were active hunters, the analyses of faunal assemblages, stone tool technologies and stable isotopic studies indicate that they exploited broader dietary resources than Neanderthals. Whereas previous studies assume taxon-specific dietary specializations, we suggest here that the diet of both Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens is determined by ecological conditions. We analyzed molar wear patterns using occlusal fingerprint analysis derived from optical 3D topometry. Molar macrowear accumulates during the lifespan of an individual and thus reflects diet over long periods. Neanderthal and early Homo sapiens maxillary molar macrowear indicates strong eco-geographic dietary variation independent of taxonomic affinities. Based on comparisons with modern hunter-gatherer populations with known diets, Neanderthals as well as early Homo sapiens show high dietary variability in Mediterranean evergreen habitats but a more restricted diet in upper latitude steppe/coniferous forest environments, suggesting a significant consumption of high protein meat resources.",3.234,894

In this study, in silico methods were used to predict the amino acid sequences, secondary and tertiary structures, and gene locations for acid lipase genes and encoded proteins using data from several mammalian genome projects. Mammalian acid lipase genes were located within a gene cluster for each of the 8 mammalian genomes examined, including human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pons troglodytes), rhesus monkey (Macacca mulatta), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), cow (Bos taurus), horse (Equus caballus) and dog (Canis familaris), with each containing 9 coding exons. Human and mouse acid lipases shared 44-87% sequence identity and exhibited sequence alignments and identities for key amino acid residues and conservation of predicted secondary and tertiary structures with those previously reported for human gastric lipase (LIPF) (Roussel et al., 1999). Evidence for a new family of acid lipase genes is reported for mouse and rat genomes, designated as Lipo. Mouse acid lipase genes are subject to differential mRNA tissue expression, with Lipa showing wide tissue expression, while others have a more restricted tissue expression in the digestive tract (Lipf), salivary gland (Lipo) and epidermal tissues (Lipk, Lipm and Lipn). Phylogenetic analyses of the mammalian acid lipase gene families suggested that these genes are products of gene duplication events prior to eutherian mammalian evolution and derived from an ancestral vertebrate LIPA gene, which is present in the frog, Xenopus tropicalis.",2.055,1655

In the latter case, however, there is no consensus over the respective groupings, and which of the two includes OH 7, the 1.8-million-year-old H. habilis holotype. This partial skull and hand from Olduvai Gorge remains pivotal to evaluating the early evolution of the Homo lineage, and by priority names one or other of the two taxa. However, the distorted preservation of the diagnostically important OH 7 mandible has hindered attempts to compare this specimen with other fossils. Here we present a virtual reconstruction of the OH 7 mandible, and compare it to other early Homo fossils. The reconstructed mandible is remarkably primitive, with a long and narrow dental arcade more similar to Australopithecus afarensis than to the derived parabolic arcades of Homo sapiens or H. erectus. We find that this shape variability is not consistent with a single species of early Homo. Importantly, the jaw morphology of OH 7 is incompatible with fossils assigned to Homo rudolfensis and with the A.L. 666-1 Homo maxilla. The latter is morphologically more derived than OH 7 but 500,000 years older, suggesting that the H. habilis lineage originated before 2.3 million years ago, thus marking deep-rooted species diversity in the genus Homo. We also reconstructed the parietal bones of OH 7 and estimated its endocranial volume. At between 729 and 824 ml it is larger than any previously published value, and emphasizes the near-complete overlap in brain size among species of early Homo. Our results clarify the H. habilis hypodigm, but raise questions about its phylogenetic relationships. Differences between species of early Homo appear to be characterized more by gnathic diversity than by differences in brain size, which was highly variable within all taxa.",41.456,144

Current debate is focused on whether early representatives from Kenya and Georgia should be classified as a separate ancestral species ('H. ergaster'), and whether H. erectus was an exclusively Asian species lineage that went extinct. Lack of resolution of these issues has obscured the place of H. erectus in human evolution. A hominid calvaria and postcranial remains recently recovered from the Dakanihylo Member of the Bouri Formation, Middle Awash, Ethiopia, bear directly on these issues. These approximately 1.0-million-year (Myr)-old Pleistocene sediments contain abundant early Acheulean stone tools and a diverse vertebrate fauna that indicates a predominantly savannah environment. Here we report that the 'Daka' calvaria's metric and morphological attributes centre it firmly within H. erectus. Daka's resemblance to Asian counterparts indicates that the early African and Eurasian fossil hominids represent demes of a widespread palaeospecies. Daka's anatomical intermediacy between earlier and later African fossils provides evidence of evolutionary change.

We found that congruent contexts had similar facilitative effects on target localization by humans and chimpanzees, whereas similar disruptive effects emerged when the stimuli were presented within incongruent contexts. When display size was manipulated, targets under the congruent-context condition were localized in a parallel manner, but those under the no-context and incongruent-context conditions were localized in a serial manner by both species. These results suggest that both humans and chimpanzees perceive emergent configurations when targets and distractors are presented within certain congruent contexts and that they process such emergent configurations preattentively.",1.087,138

FLJ36880 adopts a mixed beta-sandwich roll fold and forms homodimers in crystals as well as in solution. One Mg2+ ion is bound to each subunit of the dimeric protein by coordination to three carboxylate oxygens and three water molecules. These metal binding sites are accessible from the same surface of the dimer, partly due to the disorder of the undecapeptide stretch D29 to L39. The overall structure and metal binding site of FLJ36880 bear clear similarities to the C-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme HpcE from Escherichia coli C, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase from Mus musculus and to YcgM (Apc5008) from E. coli 1262. These similarities provide a framework for suggesting biochemical functions and evolutionary relationships of FLJ36880. It appears highly probable that the metal binding sites are involved in an enzymatic activity related to the catabolism of aromatic amino acids. Two point mutations in the active-site of FAH, responsible for the metabolic disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI) in humans, affect residues that are structurally conserved in FLJ36880 and located in the putative catalytic site.",3.268,465

Intercellular small RNA transfer can be both homotypic and heterotypic. We show SIDT1-mediated intercellular transfer of microRNA-21 to be a driver of resistance to the nucleoside analog gemcitabine in human adenocarcinoma cells. Documentation of a SIDT1-dependent small RNA transfer mechanism and the associated phenotypic effects on chemoresistance in human cancer cells raises the possibility that conserved systemic RNAi pathways contribute to the acquisition of drug resistance.

These include a globular braincase, a vertical forehead, a dimunitive browridge, a canine fossa and a pronounced chin. Humans are also unique among mammals in lacking facial projection: the face of the adult H. sapiens lies almost entirely beneath the anterior cranial fossa, whereas the face in all other adult mammals, including Neanderthals, projects to some extent in front of the braincase. Here I use radiographs and computed tomography to show that many of these unique human features stem partly from a single, ontogenetically early reduction in the length of the sphenoid, the central bone of the cranial base from which the face grows forward. Sphenoid reduction, through its effects on facial projection and cranial shape, may account for the apparently rapid evolution of modern human cranial form, and suggests that Neanderthals and other archaic Homo should be excluded from H. sapiens.",41.456,1669

The well known DNA spectra and their extensions appear the A-T-C-G--base-wise by Fourier (FT), wavelet (WT) or related transforms of the indicatory functions (IF-s) of these bases. The IF assumes either 1-in the presence or 0-in the absence of the indicated base in sequence. The IF's spectra can be next combined in a different way including the optimal one to provide the net spectrum [2]. In this contribution, it is attempted, and not limited to; showing that single channel numeric DNA also turns out to be sufficient for biologically meaningful results by DSP with accompanying merits. Plausibility is possible considering any RNA message as a single-channel coded waveform; by the triplets of the codon bases which code for 20 different amino acids. This in turn enables a clear justification for the coding rhythm in terms of the codon usage frequency (CUF) and the gene series autocorrelation. The latter simply assesses a self-similarity of the message. Along with appending well established communication insight to biological perspectives, the answer to how the genetic code is becoming specific, inducing the self-similarity of the coded sequences under the three-base-shift case is addressed. Supporting the focus, there are some findings in vertebrates' genes data elucidated by the EMD of Huang-Hilbert transform (H-HT) [3]; these are long-term spectra relevant to the coding, the content of dicodons and the structural properties of coded proteins [4]. Also a new finding in the coding rhythm--the one which is attributed to the coding DNA, is included. This is the net coding rhythms in Homo sapiens, Homo sapiens house-keeping and vertebrates' genes comparison by histograms of adaptively tracked amplitudes case.

Aspects of laterality (handedness/cerebral asymmetry/the torque) predict (1) verbal and non-verbal ability in childhood and across adult life and (2) anatomical, physiological, and linguistic variation relating to psychosis. Neuropsychological and MRI evidence from individuals with sex chromosome aneuploidies indicates that laterality is associated with an X-Y homologous gene pair. Within each mammalian species the complement of such X-Y gene pairs reflects their potential to account for taxon-specific sexual dimorphisms. As a consequence of the mechanism of meiotic suppression of unpaired chromosomes <MSUC> such X-Y gene pairs generate epigenetic variation around a species defining motif that is carried to the zygote with potential to initiate embryonic gene expression in XX or XY format. The Protocadherin11XY (PCDH11XY) gene pair in Xq21.3/Yp11.2 in probable coordination with a gene or genes within PAR2 (the second pseudo-autosomal region) is the prime candidate in relation to cerebral asymmetry and psychosis in Homo sapiens.

It is argued that humans adopted a global mode of stimulus processing of the illusory figure in our task that has favored the illusion.

The inhibition is concentration-dependent and is observed only with acylcarnitine esters with acyl chains of 12C or greater. 3. Equipotent activity is obtained using either the DL-acylcarnitine esters or the L-acylcarnitine esters. 4. Inhibition of LCAT by carnitine esters is greater than that achievable with sodium dodecylsulfate on a mol:mol basis and is not reversible with albumin. 5. The failure of the carnitine esters to inhibit plasma LCAT from man suggests the possibility of subtle differences in the structure of human LCAT compared with that in other species.",0,375
22207774,"Cooperative feeding and breeding, and the evolution of executive control.",['Vaesen K'],Biology & philosophy,2012,"Dubreuil (Biol Phil 25:53-73, 2010b, this journal) argues that modern-like cognitive abilities for inhibitory control and goal maintenance most likely evolved in Homo heidelbergensis, much before the evolution of oft-cited modern traits, such as symbolism and art. Dubreuil's argument proceeds in two steps. First, he identifies two behavioral traits that are supposed to be indicative of the presence of a capacity for inhibition and goal maintenance: cooperative feeding and cooperative breeding. Next, he tries to show that these behavioral traits most likely emerged in Homo heidelbergensis. In this paper, I show that neither of these steps are warranted in light of current scientific evidence, and thus, that the evolutionary background of human executive functions, such as inhibition and goal maintenance, remains obscure. Nonetheless, I suggest that cooperative breeding might mark a crucial step in the evolution of our species: its early emergence in Homo erectus might have favored a social intelligence that was required to get modernity really off the ground in Homo sapiens.",1.19,1208
18387651,Hominin-carnivore interactions during the Chinese Early Paleolithic: taphonomic perspectives from Xujiayao.,"['Norton CJ', 'Gao X']",Journal of human evolution,2008,"The ability of archaic Homo sapiens to survive in more northerly latitudes was contingent on securing a regular source of animal fat and protein. We present a taphonomic study that examines how successful these hominins were at acquiring these food sources during the latter part of the Early Paleolithic in Northeast Asia. This study focuses on the long bone midshaft surface modifications observed on the faunal remains from Xujiayao, a middle-late Pleistocene open-air site located at 40 degrees latitude in the western Nihewan Basin, northern China. The faunal assemblage is dominated by equid remains. Analysis of the percussion, tooth, and cut mark frequencies on the long bone midshafts demonstrates that the Xujiayao hominins had primary access to high utility (meat-bearing and marrow-rich) long bones. Investigation of the dual-patterned (tooth-marked and butchery-marked) bone fragments suggests that hominins were under little pressure from competing carnivores to abandon their kills. The lack of significant differences between the size of fragments with only percussion-marks and those with only tooth-marks supports these findings. Fragmentation ratios indicate that forelimbs were more intensively processed than hind limbs. Based on the water rounding and abrasion data, the Xujiayao assemblage is likely of autochthonous origin. Since the age of Xujiayao is still in question, we can only conclude that archaic Homo sapiens were successful predators of large game in Northeast Asia some time during the latter part of the Early Paleolithic.",3.733,1806

Second, we aimed to determine whether mid-pregnancy DNA methylation of these regions in cervical samples could predict the length of gestation. We obtained a cervical swab between 16-19 weeks gestation from 80 women participating in a Mexico City birth cohort, used pyrosequencing to analyze DNA methylation of PTGER2 and LINE 1-HS, and examined associations with maternal covariates. We used accelerated failure time models to analyze associations of DNA methylation with the length of gestation. DNA methylation of both sequences was associated with Pap smear inflammation. LINE 1-HS methylation was associated with smoke exposure, BMI and parity. In adjusted models, gestations were 3.3 days longer (95%CI 0.6, 6.0) for each interquartile range of PTGER2 DNA methylation. Higher LINE 1-HS methylation was associated with shorter gestations (-3.3 days, 95%CI -6.5, -0.2).

MCF bone remains (SD-359, SD-315, and SD-1219) from the El Sidron (Spain) neandertal site are analyzed in this context. Direct comparison of the soft and hard tissues from the same individual was studied by means of: 1) dissection of two human heads; 2) optic (white light) surface scans; 3) computed tomography and magnetic resonance of the same head. The inferior temporal sulcus and gyrus are the features most strongly influencing MCF bone surface. The Superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal and fusiform gyri also leave imprints. Temporal lobe form differs between Homo sapiens and neandertals. A wider and larger post-arcuate fossa (posterior limit of Brodmann area 20 and the anterior portion of area 37) is present in modern humans as compared to neandertals. However other traits of the MCF surface are similar in these two large-brained human groups. A conspicuous variation is appreciated in the more vertical location of the inferior temporal gyrus in H. sapiens. In parallel, structures of the lower surface of the temporal lobe are more sagittally orientated. Grooves accommodating the fusiform and the lower temporal sulci become grossly parallel to the temporal squama. These differences can be understood within the context of a supero-lateral deployment of the lobe in H. sapiens, a pattern previously identified (Bastir et al., Nat Commun 2 (2011) 588-595).

The conserved CenH3 chaperone specifically recognizes CenH3 and is required for CenH3 deposition at the centromere. Recently, the structures of the chaperone/CenH3/H4 complexes have been determined for Homo sapiens (Hs) and the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and Kluyveromyces lactis (Kl). Surprisingly, the three structures are very different, leading to different proposed structural bases for chaperone function. The question of which structural region of CenH3 provides the specificity determinant for the chaperone recognition is not fully answered. Here, we investigated these issues using solution NMR and site-directed mutagenesis. We discovered that, in contrast to previous findings, the structures of the Kl and Sc chaperone/CenH3/H4 complexes are actually very similar. This new finding reveals that both budding yeast and human chaperones use a similar structural region to block DNA from binding to the histones. Our mutational analyses further indicate that the N-terminal region of the CenH3 alpha2 helix is sufficient for specific recognition by the chaperone for both budding yeast and human. Thus, our studies have identified conserved structural bases of how the chaperones recognize CenH3 and perform the chaperone function.",4.333,1174

METHODS: The retina of controls and patients with PVR were collected and their levels of PI3K, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6k and phospho-4EBP-1 were determined by Western blot. The cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cell line D407 was treated with a specific mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (RAPA) or a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, of various concentrations and durations. Cell morphology was observed by phase contrast microscopy and the proliferation and apoptosis of treated cells were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Levels of PI3K, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, phospho-P70S6K and phospho-4EBP1 was increased in the retina in PVR (P<0.05). In D407 cells, both RAPA and LY294002 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and promoted apoptosis (P <0.05); morphologically, the cells became smaller. Both RAPA and LY294002 reduced levels of phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6k and phospho-4EBP1 expression (P <0.05). RAPA, but not LY294002, had no significant effect on PI3K expression. CONCLUSION: PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in the retinal pigment epithelial cells of PVR. The inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, RAPA and LY294002, could inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by reducing the levels of phosphorylation of mTOR pathway components.",0.705,1254
21575196,PRIN: a predicted rice interactome network.,"['Gu H', 'Zhu P', 'Jiao Y', 'Meng Y', 'Chen M']",BMC bioinformatics,2011,"BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions play a fundamental role in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of biomolecular function, signal transductions and metabolic pathways of living organisms. Although high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid system and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry are widely used in model organisms, the progress of protein-protein interactions detection in plants is rather slow. With this motivation, our work presents a computational approach to predict protein-protein interactions in Oryza sativa. RESULTS: To better understand the interactions of proteins in Oryza sativa, we have developed PRIN, a Predicted Rice Interactome Network. Protein-protein interaction data of PRIN are based on the interologs of six model organisms where large-scale protein-protein interaction experiments have been applied: yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), human (Homo sapiens), Escherichia coli K12 and Arabidopsis thaliana. With certain quality controls, altogether we obtained 76,585 non-redundant rice protein interaction pairs among 5,049 rice proteins. Further analysis showed that the topology properties of predicted rice protein interaction network are more similar to yeast than to the other 5 organisms. This may not be surprising as the interologs based on yeast contribute nearly 74% of total interactions. In addition, GO annotation, subcellular localization information and gene expression data are also mapped to our network for validation. Finally, a user-friendly web interface was developed to offer convenient database search and network visualization. CONCLUSIONS: PRIN is the first well annotated protein interaction database for the important model plant Oryza sativa. It has greatly extended the current available protein-protein interaction data of rice with a computational approach, which will certainly provide further insights into rice functional genomics and systems biology.

18789811,Brain size at birth throughout human evolution: a new method for estimating neonatal brain size in hominins.,"['DeSilva JM', 'Lesnik JJ']",Journal of human evolution,2008,"An increase in brain size is a hallmark of human evolution. Questions regarding the evolution of brain development and obstetric constraints in the human lineage can be addressed with accurate estimates of the size of the brain at birth in hominins. Previous estimates of brain size at birth in fossil hominins have been calculated from regressions of neonatal body or brain mass to adult body mass, but this approach is problematic for two reasons: modern humans are outliers for these regressions, and hominin adult body masses are difficult to estimate. To accurately estimate the brain size at birth in extinct human ancestors, an equation is needed for which modern humans fit the anthropoid regression and one in which the hominin variable entered into the regression equation has limited error. Using phylogenetically sensitive statistics, a resampling approach, and brain-mass data from the literature and from National Primate Research Centers on 362 neonates and 2802 adults from eight different anthropoid species, we found that the size of the adult brain can strongly predict the size of the neonatal brain (r2=0.97). This regression predicts human brain size, indicating that humans have precisely the brain size expected as an adult given the size of the brain at birth. We estimated the size of the neonatal brain in fossil hominins from a reduced major axis regression equation using published cranial capacities of 89 adult fossil crania. We suggest that australopiths gave birth to infants with cranial capacities that were on average 180cc (95% CI: 158-205cc), slightly larger than the average neonatal brain size of chimpanzees. Neonatal brain size increased in early Homo to 225cc (95% CI: 198-257cc) and in Homo erectus to approximately 270cc (95% CI: 237-310cc). These results have implications for interpreting the evolution of the birth process and brain development in all hominins from the australopiths and early Homo, through H. erectus, to Homo sapiens.",3.733,1717
23281936,Supervised maximum-likelihood weighting of composite protein networks for complex prediction.,"['Yong CH', 'Liu G', 'Chua HN', 'Wong L']",BMC systems biology,2012,"BACKGROUND: Protein complexes participate in many important cellular functions, so finding the set of existent complexes is essential for understanding the organization and regulation of processes in the cell. With the availability of large amounts of high-throughput protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, many algorithms have been proposed to discover protein complexes from PPI networks. However, such approaches are hindered by the high rate of noise in high-throughput PPI data, including spurious and missing interactions. Furthermore, many transient interactions are detected between proteins that are not from the same complex, while not all proteins from the same complex may actually interact. As a result, predicted complexes often do not match true complexes well, and many true complexes go undetected. RESULTS: We address these challenges by integrating PPI data with other heterogeneous data sources to construct a composite protein network, and using a supervised maximum-likelihood approach to weight each edge based on its posterior probability of belonging to a complex. We then use six different clustering algorithms, and an aggregative clustering strategy, to discover complexes in the weighted network. We test our method on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens, and show that complex discovery is improved: compared to previously proposed supervised and unsupervised weighting approaches, our method recalls more known complexes, achieves higher precision at all recall levels, and generates novel complexes of greater functional similarity. Furthermore, our maximum-likelihood approach allows learned parameters to be used to visualize and evaluate the evidence of novel predictions, aiding human judgment of their credibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach integrates multiple data sources with supervised learning to create a weighted composite protein network, and uses six clustering algorithms with an aggregative clustering strategy to discover novel complexes. We show improved performance over previous approaches in terms of precision, recall, and number and quality of novel predictions. We present and visualize two novel predicted complexes in yeast and human, and find external evidence supporting these predictions.",2.435,1401

The results demonstrate that gorillas and chimpanzees excrete 4- to 5-fold less estrogen during pregnancy than the human and orangutan which are similar to each other.

We mapped sites of O-GlcNAc modification by electron transfer dissociation MS and found that they correlate with previously detected O-GlcNAc sites. Crystal structures of four acceptor peptides in complex with Homo sapiens OGT suggest that a combination of size and conformational restriction defines sequence specificity in the -3 to +2 subsites.

16905154,Mitochondrial tRNA sequences as unusual replication origins: pathogenic implications for Homo sapiens.,"['Seligmann H', 'Krishnan NM', 'Rao BJ']",Journal of theoretical biology,2006,"The heavy strand of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes accumulates deaminations proportionally to the time it spends single-stranded during replication. A previous study showed that the strength of genome-wide deamination gradients originating from tRNA gene's locations increases with their capacities to form secondary structures resembling mitochondrial origins of light strand replication (OL), suggesting an alternative function for tRNA sequences. We hypothesize that this function is frequently pathogenic for those tRNA genes that normally do not form OL-like structures, because this could cause excess mutations in genome regions unadapted to tolerate them. In human mitochondrial genomes, pathogenic tRNA variants usually form less OL-like structures than non-pathogenic ones in cases where the normal non-pathogenic tRNA variant can function as OL, as evolutionary analyses reveal. For tRNAs lacking the putative OL-like functioning capacity, pathogenic variants form more OL-like secondary structures, particularly structures that might invoke bi-directional replication (true for 14 among 21 tRNA species, p<0.05, sign test; significantly at p<0.05 (1 tailed test) for 7 tRNA species), but not more unidirectional replication invoking structures. Accounting for the functional cloverleaf-like structure-forming capacities of tRNAs yields similar results. Rare, non-pathogenic tRNA mutants tend to form more OL-like structures than the common, non-pathogenic ones, suggesting weak directional selection also among non-pathogenic variants. The duration spent single stranded by a region of the heavy strand (D(ssH)) during replication, estimated by integrating over all regions that can function as OL in Homo sapiens mitochondrial genomes, increases with distance of that region from the Dloop. This suggests convergence of single-strandedness during replication and transcription, and explains conserved locations of tRNA species in mitochondrial genomes and bacterial operons. These locations minimize deamination costs only in anticodons and not in other tRNA regions, during replication and transcription. Therefore, putative functioning as OLs by tRNA sequences is normal at some locations and pathogenic at others.",2.116,357

Recent evidence shows that, like humans, chimpanzee faces also contain personality information, and that humans can accurately judge aspects of chimpanzee personality relating to extraversion from the face alone (Kramer, King, and Ward, 2011). These findings suggest the hypothesis that humans and chimpanzees share a system of personality and facial morphology for signaling socially-relevant traits from the face. We sought to test this hypothesis using a new group of chimpanzees. In two studies, we found that chimpanzee faces contained health information, as well as information of characteristics relating to extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness, using average judgments from pairs of individual photographs. In a third study, information relating to extraversion and health was also present in composite images of individual chimpanzees.

25888527,Phylogeny and evolution of plant macrophage migration inhibitory factor/D-dopachrome tautomerase-like proteins.,"['Panstruga R', 'Baumgarten K', 'Bernhagen J']",BMC evolutionary biology,2015,"BACKGROUND: The human (Homo sapiens) chemokine-like protein macrophage migration inhibitory factor (HsMIF) is a pivotal mediator of inflammatory, infectious and immune diseases including septic shock, colitis, malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis, as well as tumorigenesis. HsMIF has been found to exhibit several sequential and three-dimensional sequence motifs that in addition to its receptor binding sites include catalytic sites for oxidoreductase and tautomerase activity, which provide this 12.5 kDa protein with a remarkable functional complexity. A human MIF paralog, D-dopachrome tautomerase (HsDDT), has been identified, but its physiological relevance is incompletely understood. MIF/DDT-like proteins have been described in animals, protists and bacteria. Although based on sequence data banks the presence of MIF/DDT-like proteins has also been recognized in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, details on these plant proteins have not been reported. RESULTS: To broaden the understanding of the biological role of these proteins across kingdoms we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of plant MIF/DDT-like (MDL) genes/proteins. We found that the A. thaliana genome harbors three MDL genes, of which two are chiefly constitutively expressed in aerial plant organs, while the third gene shows stress-inducible transcript accumulation. The product of the latter gene likely localizes to peroxisomes. Structure prediction suggests that all three Arabidopsis proteins resemble the secondary and tertiary structure of human MIF. MIF-like proteins are found in all species across the plant kingdom, with an increasing family complexity towards evolutionarily advanced plant taxa. Plant MDL proteins are predicted to lack oxidoreductase activity, but possibly share tautomerase activity with human MIF/DDT. CONCLUSIONS: Peroxisome localization seems to be a specific feature of a subset of MIF/DDT orthologs found in dicotyledonous plant species, which together with its stress-inducible gene expression might point to convergent evolution in higher plants and vertebrates towards neofunctionalization of MIF/MDL proteins in stress response pathways including innate immunity.",3.368,790

A total of 212 crania representing Paleo-Aleuts and Aleutian as defined by Hrdlicka were investigated for suture synostosis pattern following standard methodologies. Comparisons were performed using Guttmann analyses. Results revealed similar suture fusion patterns for the Paleo-Aleut and Aleutian, a strong anterior to posterior pattern of suture fusion for the lateral-anterior suture sites, and a pattern of early termination at the sagittal suture sites for the vault. These patterns were found to differ from that reported in the literature. Because these two populations with distinct cranial shapes exhibit similar patterns of suture synostosis it appears pattern is independent of cranial shape in these populations of Homo sapiens. These findings suggest that suture fusion patterns may be population dependent and that a standardized methodology, using suture fusion to determine age-at-death, may not be applicable to all populations.",1.542,1536
23959924,Do olympic athletes train as in the Paleolithic era?,[],"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2013,"Every 4 years, approximately 10,000 athletes participate in the Olympic Games. These athletes have dedicated several years of physical training to achieve the best possible performance on a given day. Their preparation has been supported by expert coaches and an army of sport scientists, whose overall responsibility is to ensure that the athletes are in peak condition for their event. Although every athlete prepares specifically for the unique physiological challenges of their event, all athletes have one common characteristic: they are Homo sapiens. They share a unique genome, which is the result of evolutionary forces beyond their individual control. Although studies on the influence of different genetic polymorphisms on selected athletic events have been proven to be of limited utility, a body of evidence--from molecular biology to whole-body measures--suggests that training adaptations are enhanced when the stimulus closely resembles the activity pattern of human ancestors. Because genetic evolutionary changes occur slowly in Homo sapiens, and the traditional physical activity and dietary patterns of Homo sapiens have undergone rapid and dramatic changes in previous centuries, we propose that modern humans are physiologically better adapted to training modes and nutritional strategies similar to the ones that their hominid ancestors evolved on, rather than those supported by modern societies. Such an ancestral pattern was mainly characterized by the prevalence of daily bouts of prolonged, low-intensity, aerobic-based activities interspersed with periodic, short-duration, high-intensity bursts of activity. On some occasions, such activity patterns were undertaken with low carbohydrate availability. Specific activities that enhanced strength and power were typically performed after aerobic activities. We present scientific evidence to support the appropriateness of this model, and we propose that future studies should address this hypothesis in a multitude of different sporting activities, by assessing the genetic responses to and performance-based outcomes of different training stimuli. Such information would provide data on which sport scientists and coaches could better prepare athletes and manage their training process.",0,441

In this study, the random forest models based on local sequence-structure features were proposed to identify miRNA in four species. The accuracies achieved were 86.51% for Homo sapiens, 81.66% for Ornithorhynchus anatinus, 82.33% for Mus musculus and 85.71% for Schmidtea mediterranea, respectively. Furthermore, the important analysis of feature elements was carried out by using the conditional feature importance strategy. The analysis results revealed that most of the significant elements were related to guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair.

It consists of a cascade of reactions that form a highly branched network in which the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction. Metabolic pathways efficiently produce maximal amount of biomass while maintaining a steady-state behavior. The steady-state activity of such biochemical pathways necessarily incorporates feedback inhibition of the enzymes. This observation motivates us to incorporate feedback inhibition for modeling the optimal activity of metabolic pathways using flux balance analysis (FBA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on a synthetic pathway with and without feedback inhibition. Similarly, for the first time, the Central Carbon Metabolic (CCM) pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens have been modeled and compared based on the above understanding. The optimal pathway, which maximizes the amount of the target product(s), is selected from all those obtained by the proposed method. For this, we have observed the concentration of the product inhibited enzymes of CCM pathway and its influence on its corresponding metabolite/substrate. We have also studied the concentration of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of target products. We further hypothesize that an optimal pathway would opt for higher flux rate reactions. In light of these observations, we can say that an optimal pathway should have lower enzyme concentration and higher flux rates. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method by comparing it with the extreme pathway analysis.",0.783,1215

The present study used regular cubic blocks as well as cubic blocks with bumps on two sides. The bumps changed the physical properties of the blocks and increased the difficulty involved in stacking them. Subjects were required to choose the appropriate orientation for stacking the blocks. Three juvenile chimpanzees and 14 human children (aged 2-3 years) were tested under identical task settings in a face-to-face situation. The goal of a trial was to stack up four blocks (two cubic blocks and two cubic blocks with bumps). The results showed initial difficulty in stacking the blocks with bumps in both chimpanzees and humans. Experienced juvenile chimpanzees and humans older than 3 years became proficient at solving the task. Behavioral strategies adopted to succeed in the task were common to both species. The subjects spontaneously adopted a strategy of stacking as the last block of the tower a block with a bump facing upwards. The subjects also showed active change in the orientation of the blocks when necessary, although correct orientation changes were infrequent especially during the early phases of experiment.

21342548,Comparative analysis of protein interaction networks reveals that conserved pathways are susceptible to HIV-1 interception.,"['Qian X', 'Yoon BJ']",BMC bioinformatics,2011,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) is the major pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). With the availability of large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) measurements, comparative network analysis can provide a promising way to study the host-virus interactions and their functional significance in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Until now, there have been a large number of HIV studies based on various animal models. In this paper, we present a novel framework for studying the host-HIV interactions through comparative network analysis across different species. RESULTS: Based on the proposed framework, we test our hypothesis that HIV-1 attacks essential biological pathways that are conserved across species. We selected the Homo sapiens and Mus musculus PPI networks with the largest coverage among the PPI networks that are available from public databases. By using a local network alignment algorithm based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), we first identified the pathways that are conserved in both networks. Next, we analyzed the HIV-1 susceptibility of these pathways, in comparison with random pathways in the human PPI network. Our analysis shows that the conserved pathways have a significantly higher probability of being intercepted by HIV-1. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis shows that most of the enriched GO terms are related to signal transduction, which has been conjectured to be one of the major mechanisms targeted by HIV-1 for the takeover of the host cell. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study clearly shows that the comparative analysis of PPI networks across different species can provide important insights into the host-HIV interactions and the detailed mechanisms of HIV-1. We expect that comparative multiple network analysis of various species that have different levels of susceptibility to similar lentiviruses may provide a very effective framework for generating novel, and experimentally verifiable hypotheses on the mechanisms of HIV-1. We believe that the proposed framework has the potential to expedite the elucidation of the important mechanisms of HIV-1, and ultimately, the discovery of novel anti-HIV drugs.",2.576,1557

Such statistical approaches could facilitate the identification of new promoter regions playing a role in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In the case of mammalian oligonucleotides, we found that the published set of frequent decamers enriched in transcriptional motifs is not suitable for studies on genes of Homo sapiens and evolutionarily related genomes, because it contains decameric sequences belonging to genomic repeats. We report here that most of the decameric sequences of DNA repeats belong to Alu repeats. Accordingly, we produced a subset of Alu-free frequent decamers. In addition, we eliminated from the subset of Alu-free frequent decamers those that are frequently present within other common human repeats, including (GT)n, (AT)n, (CA)n, (ATT)n, (CAA)n and (GTT)n. The Alu-free (repeats-free) subset of frequent mammalian decamers is enriched in signals for transcription factors and allows the identification of putative signals in genes, such as those coding for plasminogen activator, adenosine deaminase and p53, that contain a large number of Alu-like repeats interspersed within our genomic sequences.

We analyzed the human genome for the complete complement of this family and have identified a total of 31 independent gene sequences. The predominant organization of C1q-domain-containing (C1qDC) proteins includes a leading signal peptide, a collagen-like region of variable length, and a C-terminal C1q domain. There are 15 highly conserved residues within the C1q domain, among which 8 are invariant within the human gene set and these are predicted to cluster within the hydrophobic core of the protein. We suggest a 3-subfamily classification based on sequence homology. For some C1qDC-encoding genes, strict orthology has been retained throughout vertebrate evolution and these examples suggest a highly specific functional role for C1qDC proteins that has been under significant selective pressure. Alternatively, individual species have co-opted C1qDC proteins for roles that are highly specific to their biology, suggesting an evolutionary strategy of gene duplication and functional diversification. A more extensive analysis of the evolutionary relationship of C1qDC proteins reveals an ancient rooting, with clear members found in eubacterial species. Curiously, we have been unable to identify C1qDC-encoding genes in many eukaryotic genomcs, such as Sacchromyces cerivisae and C. elegans, suggesting that the retention or loss of this gene family throughout evolution has been sporadic.",2.284,487

India, therefore, served as a major corridor for dispersal of modern humans. By studying variation at DNA level in contemporary human populations of India, we have provided evidence that mitochondrial DNA haplotypes based on RFLPs are strikingly similar across ethnic groups of India, consistent with the hypothesis that a small number of females entered India during the initial process of the peopling of India. We have also provided evidence that there may have been dispersal of humans from India to southeast Asia. In conjunction with haplotype data, nucleotide sequence data of a hypervariable segment (HVS-1) of the mitochondrial genome indicate that the ancestors of the present austro-asiatic tribal populations may have been the most ancient inhabitants of India.

To reveal hypothesized novel EPOR/JAK2 targets, a phosphotyrosine (PY) phosphoproteomics approach was applied. Beyond known signal transduction factors, 32 new targets of EPO-modulated tyrosine phosphorylation were defined. Molecular adaptors comprised one major set including growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)-associated binding proteins 1-3 (GAB1-3), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), docking protein 1 (DOK1), Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein 1 (SHC1), and sprouty homologue 1 (SPRY1) as validating targets, and SPRY2, SH2 domain containing 2A (SH2D2A), and signal transducing adaptor molecule 2 (STAM2) as novel candidate adaptors together with an ORF factor designated as regulator of human erythroid cell expansion (RHEX). RHEX is well conserved in Homo sapiens and primates but absent from mouse, rat, and lower vertebrate genomes. Among tissues and lineages, RHEX was elevated in EPCs, occurred as a plasma membrane protein, was rapidly PY-phosphorylated >20-fold upon EPO exposure, and coimmunoprecipitated with the EPOR. In UT7epo cells, knockdown of RHEX inhibited EPO-dependent growth. This was associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1,2 (ERK1,2) modulation, and RHEX coupling to GRB2. In primary human EPCs, shRNA knockdown studies confirmed RHEX regulation of erythroid progenitor expansion and further revealed roles in promoting the formation of hemoglobinizing erythroblasts. RHEX therefore comprises a new EPO/EPOR target and regulator of human erythroid cell expansion that additionally acts to support late-stage erythroblast development.",0,915

Namely, there is an increased frequency of T>C mutations in the second position of the words ATTG and ATAG and an increased frequency of A>C mutations in the first position of the word ACAA. Previous studies have also shown that there is a remarkable difference between the mutagenesis of humans and drosophila. While C>T mutations are overrepresented in the CG context in humans (and other vertebrates), this mutation regularity is not observed in Drosophila melanogaster. Such differences in the observed regularities of mutagenesis between representatives of different taxa might reflect differences in the mechanisms involved in mutagenesis. We performed a systematical comparison of mutation regularities within 2-4 bp contexts in Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster and found that the aforementioned contexts are not hypermutable in fruit flies. It seems that most mutation contexts affect mutation rates in a similar manner in H. sapiens and D. melanogaster; however, several important exceptions are noted and discussed.",0.953,1058

Its intimacy to the cell's antenna, namely the primary cilia, makes it also involved in some signaling transduction pathways. To test the idea that KIF3A functions during spermiogenesis of the octopod Octopus tankahkeei, we hereby identified a gene (designated as ot-kif3a) encoding a protein apparently homologous to a group of KIF3As, from the testis of this organism. The full-length ot-kif3a comprised a 344bp 5' untranslated region, a 2241bp open reading frame and a 147bp 3' untranslated region. The putative protein consisted of 746 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 85kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 6.36. It shared an overall sequence identity of 69%, 69%, 69% and 67% to KIF3A from Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Danio rerio, respectively. Tissue distribution profile analysis unraveled its presence in all the tissues examined. In situ hybridization of mRNA in spermionenic cells demonstrated that ot-kif3a was expressed moderately at the beginning of spermiogenesis. The abundance of transcripts increased in intermediate spermatid and peaked in drastically remodeling and final spermatids. In mature sperm, the message was still visible in the head and tail. The temporal and spatial expression dynamics of ot-kif3a during spermiogenesis supports the possibility that the putative motor protein, OtKIF3A, participates in the major cytological events during this differentiation program and is vital for the acquisition of the final cellular phenotype.",2.055,1612

Here we assess how varying levels of plasticity and constraint affect this structure and influence the response to habitual loading along the diaphysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional geometric properties including total area, cortical area, and rigidity were compared from the upper (humerus: 50% of length, radius: 66%, 50%, 4%) and lower (tibia: 50%, 38%, 4%) limbs of male varsity-level athletes and matched controls with distinct habitual loading histories. RESULTS: Geometric properties among cricketers and swimmers were significantly greater at the humeral midshaft, mid-proximal radius, and radial midshaft compared to controls. By contrast, no significant differences were found among athletes or controls at the distal radius. The tibial midshafts of hockey players and runners also displayed greater area and rigidity compared to controls. Differences in geometry among the three groups became less pronounced distally, where structure was comparable among athletes and controls at 4% of tibial length. Additionally, coefficients of variation revealed that variation among athletes of the same sport was highest distally in both the upper and lower limb and lowest at midshaft, where structure most closely reflected the activity pattern of each loading group. DISCUSSION: These results support previous research suggesting that distal limb sections are more tightly constrained by safety factors compared to midshafts and proximal sections. Overall, it appears that plasticity and constraint vary not only between limb segments in correspondence to known activity patterns, but also along specific sections of the diaphysis.",2.379,33

By northern hybridization, the transcription of sahhl gene was analyzed in M. amphibiorum RCS1 mycelia culture process from darkness to blue light to darkness. Simultaneously real-time PCR method was used to the sahhl gene expression analysis.

This paper summarizes and focuses on some of the evidence for Homo floresiensis in context, as presented in this Special Issue edition of the Journal of Human Evolution and elsewhere. Attempts to dismiss the Pleistocene hominins (and the type specimen LB1 in particular) as pathological pygmy humans are not compatible with detailed analyses of the skull, teeth, brain endocast, and postcranium. We initially concluded that H. floresiensis may have evolved by insular dwarfing of a larger-bodied hominin species over 880k.yr. or more. However, recovery of additional specimens and the numerous primitive morphological traits seen throughout the skeleton suggest instead that it is more likely to be a late representative of a small-bodied lineage that exited Africa before the emergence of Homo erectus sensu lato. Homo floresiensis is clearly not an australopithecine, but does retain many aspects of anatomy (and perhaps behavior) that are probably plesiomorphic for the genus Homo.

Previous research has focused exclusively on the energy requirements of adults and highlights the high energy demands of these individuals compared with modern humans. Less attention has been paid to the energy requirements of sub-adult Neandertals, even though this age group could provide clues for a better understanding of Neandertal life history. Accordingly, herein, we estimate the energy costs of maintenance and growth in Neandertal infants and children from one to six years of age and compare these costs with values for modern humans. Statural growth models for two modern human populations (Beasain and Evenki) and an average Neandertal model population are used to establish weight growth models. In turn, these models of body weight growth are used to estimate key components of energetic variables (basal metabolic rate, total energy expenditure, energy of growth and daily energy requirements). Between three and six years of age, Neandertal children have slightly lower basal and growth energy costs than do modern humans of the same age, due primarily to their smaller body mass and slower growth rates. The reduction in energy allocated to growth is likely the result of metabolic adaptations to other somatic factors and thermal stress. Data from contemporary human infants and children suggest that even mild cold stress increases non-shivering thermogenesis, thus elevating metabolic needs by 50% or more. These results suggest that thermal stress likely played a strong role in shaping the delayed developmental patterns and lower energy allocated to growth during early life in Neandertals relative to Homo sapiens.",3.733,636

Several detection methods have been developed, however they require either transfection of cells with the probe or prior tagging of the target RNA. We report a fully genetically encodable system for simultaneous detection of two RNAs by using green and yellow fluorescence based on tetramolecular fluorescence complementation (TetFC). To obtain yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), substitution T203Y was introduced into one of the three non-fluorescent GFP fragments; this was fused to different variants of the Homo sapiens Pumilio homology domain. Using different sets of fusion proteins we were able to discriminate between two closely related target RNAs based on the fluorescence signals at the respective wavelengths.",0,666

With the genomes of an increasing number of plant species sequenced, it is possible to gain novel insights into mitochondrial protein import pathways. We have generated the Mitochondrial Protein Import Components (MPIC) Database (DB; http://www.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/applications/mpic) providing searchable information on the protein import apparatus of plant and non-plant mitochondria. An in silico analysis was carried out, comparing the mitochondrial protein import apparatus from 24 species representing various lineages from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and algae to Homo sapiens (human) and higher plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Oryza sativa (rice) and other more recently sequenced plant species. Each of these species was extensively searched and manually assembled for analysis in the MPIC DB. The database presents an interactive diagram in a user-friendly manner, allowing users to select their import component of interest. The MPIC DB presents an extensive resource facilitating detailed investigation of the mitochondrial protein import machinery and allowing patterns of conservation and divergence to be recognized that would otherwise have been missed.

22278710,Scratching around mating: factors affecting anxiety in wild Lemur catta.,"['Sclafani V', 'Norscia I', 'Antonacci D', 'Palagi E']",Primates; journal of primatology,2012,"Scratching has been successfully used to detect anxiety, a proxy for stress, in primates, from strepsirrhines to Homo sapiens. Here, we investigated the fluctuation of scratching in Lemur catta during the mating season. In particular we evaluated whether scratching (1) varied according to sex and rank differences, (2) increased in the period of maximum stress (around the mating days), and (3) was reduced by grooming. At Berenty (South Madagascar), we followed two lemur groups (23 adult/subadult individuals) and gathered data on self-scratching, aggression, and grooming. Based on perineal area features, we recognized two periods: low swelling (LS), with no estrus female, and high swelling (HS), when at least one female was in estrus. We predicted that aggressive behaviors and anxiety-related scratching would covary. Indeed, scratching peaked in HS, when aggression was also highest. In agreement with previous literature, this result suggests that conflicts around estrus days may raise anxiety levels in the social group. We expected scratching levels to be highest in males because they aggressively compete for females and are subject to mate choice and repeated attacks by dominant females. Instead, the scratching rates were similar in males and females, probably because the high competition, which involves both sexes, dampened intersexual differences. In contrast to our prediction, scratching was not rank dependent, probably because animal ranking positions changed from LS to HS. Finally, we showed that, in ring-tailed lemurs, as well as in other primates, scratching decreases after reciprocal grooming in both periods. This finding provides the first evidence that grooming could assist in reducing anxiety in strepsirrhines.",0,1339

We suppose that a protein is a multiset of domains. Since gene duplication and fusion have occurred through evolutionary processes, the same domains and the same compositions of domains appear in multiple proteins, which enables us to compress a proteome by using references to proteins for duplicated and fused proteins. Such a network with references to at most two proteins is modeled as a directed hypergraph. We propose a heuristic approach by combining the Edmonds algorithm and an integer linear programming, and apply our procedure to 14 proteomes of Dictyostelium discoideum, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Danio rerio, Xenopus laevis, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens.

The fundamental question of whether the scission of the two DHO C-H bonds is concerted or stepwise was addressed for two Class 2 enzymes, those from Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens, by determining kinetic isotope effects on flavin reduction in anaerobic stopped-flow experiments. Isotope effects were determined for the E. coli enzyme at two pH values below a previously reported pKa controlling reduction [Palfey, B. A., Bjornberg, O., and Jensen K. F. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 4381-4390] and were about 3-fold for DHO labeled at the 5-position, about 4-fold for DHO labeled at the 6-position, and about 6-7-fold for DHO labeled at both the 5- and 6-positions. These isotope effects are consistent with either a stepwise oxidation of DHO or a concerted mechanism with significant quantum mechanical tunneling. At a pH value above the pKa controlling reduction, no isotope effect was observed in E. coli DHOD for DHO deuterated at the 5-position (the proton donor in the reaction). This is consistent with a stepwise reaction; above the (kinetic) pKa, the deprotonation of C5 is fast enough that it does not contribute to the observed rate constant and, therefore, is not isotopically sensitive. All available information points to Ser acting as a component in a proton relay network which allows its transient deprotonation. The H. sapiens DHOD also appears to have a pKa near 9.4 controlling reduction, similar to that previously reported for the E. coli enzyme. Similar KIEs were obtained with the H. sapiens enzyme at a pH value below the pKa.",3.015,1822

LeuRS contains a catalysis domain (aminoacylation) and a CP1 domain (editing). CP1 is inserted 35 A from the aminoacylation domain. Aminoacylation and editing require CP1 to swing to the coordinated conformation. The neck between the CP1 domain and the aminoacylation domain is defined as the CP1 hairpin. The location of the CP1 hairpin suggests a crucial role in the CP1 swing and domain-domain interaction. Here, the CP1 hairpin of Homo sapiens cytoplasmic LeuRS (hcLeuRS) was deleted or substituted by those from other representative species. Lack of a CP1 hairpin led to complete loss of aminoacylation, amino acid activation, and tRNA binding; however, the mutants retained post-transfer editing. Only the CP1 hairpin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae LeuRS (ScLeuRS) could partly rescue the hcLeuRS functions. Further site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the flexibility of small residues and the charge of polar residues in the CP1 hairpin are crucial for the function of LeuRS.",0,396

For analysis of numerous different targets the synthesis of these probes contributes to the overall cost during assay development. Sequence-dependent universal detection techniques overcome this drawback but are prone to detection of unspecific amplification products. We developed the mediator probe PCR as a solution to these problems. METHODS: A set of label-free sequence-specific primary probes (mediator probes), each comprising a target-specific region and a standardized mediator tag, is cleaved upon annealing to its target sequence by the polymerases' 5' nuclease activity. Release of a mediator triggers signal generation by cleavage of a complementary fluorogenic reporter probe. RESULTS: Real-time PCR amplification of human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Homo sapiens DNA dilution series showed exceptional linearity when detected either by novel mediator probes (r(2) = 0.991-0.999) or state-of-the-art hydrolysis probes (TaqMan probes) (r(2) = 0.975-0.993). For amplification of HPV18 DNA the limits of detection were 78.3 and 85.1 copies per 10-muL reaction when analyzed with the mediator probe and hydrolysis probe, respectively. Duplex amplification of HPV18 target DNA and internal standard had no effects on back calculation of target copy numbers when quantified with either the mediator probe PCR (r(2) = 0.998) or the hydrolysis probe PCR (r(2) = 0.988). CONCLUSIONS: The mediator probe PCR has equal performance to hydrolysis probe PCR and has reduced costs because of the use of universal fluorogenic reporters.",7.911,1230

Proximity of the core promoter STRs to the +1 transcription start site (TSS), and their mutable nature are characteristics that highlight those STRs as a novel source of interspecies variation. The PAXBP1 gene (alternatively known as GCFC1) core promoter contains the longest STR identified in a Homo sapiens gene core promoter. Indeed, this core promoter is a stretch of four consecutive CT-STRs. In the current study, we used the Ensembl, NCBI, and UCSC databases to analyze the evolutionary trend and functional implication of this CT-STR complex in six major lineages across vertebrates, including primates, non-primate mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. We observed exceptional expansion (>/=4-repeats) and conservation of this CT-STR complex across primates, except prosimians, Microcebus murinus and Otolemur garnettii (Fisher exact P<4.1x10(-7)). H. sapiens has the most complex STR formula, and longest repeats. Macaca mulatta and Callithrix jacchus monkeys have the simplest STR formulas, and shortest repeat numbers. CT>/=4-repeats were not detected in non-primate lineages. Different length alleles across the PAXBP1 core promoter CT-STRs significantly altered gene expression in vitro (P<0.001, t-test).

The results show that the different ratios of forearm-rotation muscles between chimpanzee and gibbons may be related to the differences in their main positional behaviour, i.e. knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and brachiation in gibbons, and the different frequencies of arm-raising locomotion between these two species. Moreover, monkeys have larger normalized MM values for the elbow extensor muscles than apes, which may be attributed to the fact that almost all monkeys engage in quadrupedal locomotion.

For full activity a kinase molecule must be penetrated by two stacks of hydrophobic residues, the regulatory and the catalytic spine that are normally well conserved among active protein kinases. We apply this novel spine concept here on CK2alpha, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2. Homo sapiens disposes of two paralog isoforms of CK2alpha (hsCK2alpha and hsCK2alpha'). We describe two new structures of hsCK2alpha constructs one of which in complex with the ATP-analog adenylyl imidodiphosphate and the other with the ATP-competitive inhibitor 3-(4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)propan-1-ol. The former is the first hsCK2alpha structure with a well defined cosubstrate/magnesium complex and the second with an open beta4/beta5-loop. Comparisons of these structures with existing CK2alpha/CK2alpha' and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) structures reveal: in hsCK2alpha' an open conformation of the interdomain hinge/helix alphaD region that is critical for ATP-binding is found corresponding to an incomplete catalytic spine. In contrast hsCK2alpha often adopts the canonical, PKA-like version of the catalytic spine which correlates with a closed conformation of the hinge region. HsCK2alpha can switch to the incomplete, non-canonical, hsCK2alpha'-like state of the catalytic spine, but this transition apparently depends on binding of either ATP or of the regulatory subunit CK2beta.

RESULTS: We have exhaustively sequenced an Expression Sequence Tag (EST) library made from a pool of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from sixteen Chlorocebus sabaeus monkeys. Twelve of them were infected with the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus. The mononuclear cells were or not stimulated in vitro with Concanavalin A, with lipopolysacharrides, or through mixed lymphocyte reaction in order to generate a representative and broad library of expressed sequences in immune cells. We report here 37,787 sequences, which were assembled into 14,410 contigs representing an estimated 12% of the C. sabaeus transcriptome. Using data from primate genome databases, 9,029 assembled sequences from C. sabaeus could be annotated. Sequences have been systematically aligned with ten cDNA references of primate species including Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Macaca mulatta to identify ortholog transcripts. For 506 transcripts, sequences were quasi-complete. In addition, 6,576 transcript fragments are potentially specific to the C. sabaeus or corresponding to not yet described primate genes.

It is a building block for polysaccharides such as chitin, and several glucosaminoglycans and proteins can be O-GlcNAcylated. The deacetylated form, glucosamine, is an integral part of GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors. Both are incorporated into polymers by glycosyltransferases that utilize UDP-GlcNAc. This UDP-sugar is synthesized in a short pathway comprising four steps starting from fructose 6-phosphate. GNA (glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) catalyses the second of these four reactions in the de novo synthesis in eukaryotes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that only one GNA isoform can be found in most of the species investigated and that the most likely Arabidopsis candidate is encoded by the gene At5g15770 (AtGNA). qPCR (quantitative PCR) revealed the ubiquitous expression of AtGNA in all organs of Arabidopsis plants. Heterologous expression of AtGNA showed that it is highly active between pH 7 and 8 and at temperatures of 30-40 degrees C.

Several factors, including melting temperature, primer length, GC content, internal self-complement, cross-dimerization, terminal limitation, and specificity, are used as the criteria for designing primers. This study obtains a near-optimal solution of primer sets that can be placed in as few test tubes as possible for one multiplex PCR experiment.

 American Societies for Experimental Biology",2011,"Airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction is an important component of the pathophysiology of asthma. Taurine, an agonist of glycine receptor chloride (GlyR Cl(-)) channels, was found to relax contracted ASM, which led us to question whether functional GlyR Cl(-) channels are expressed in ASM. Messenger RNA for beta (GLRB), alpha1 (GLRA1), alpha2 (GLRA2), and alpha4 (GLRA4) subunits were found in human (Homo sapiens) and guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) tracheal smooth muscle. Immunoblotting confirmed the protein expression of GLRA1 and GLRB subunits in ASM. Electrical activity of cultured human ASM cells was assessed using a fluorescent potentiometric dye and electrophysiological recordings. Glycine increased current and significantly increased fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner. The GlyR Cl(-) channel antagonist strychnine significantly blocked the effects of glycine on potentiometric fluorescence in ASM cells. Guinea pig airway ring relaxation of ACh-induced contractions by isoproterenol was significantly left-shifted in the presence of glycine. This effect of glycine was blocked by pretreatment with the GlyR Cl(-) channel antagonist strychnine. Glycine treatment during tachykinin- and acetylcholine-induced contractions significantly decreased the maintenance of muscle force compared to control. GlyR Cl(-) channels are expressed on ASM and regulate smooth muscle force and offer a novel target for therapeutic relaxation of ASM.",0,1520

The 3DGM methods were applied in a comparative framework in order to improve our understanding of trait polarity in features related to Homo pectoral girdle evolution, using other Neandertals, Homo sapiens, Pan, ATD6-50 (Homo antecessor), and KNM-WT 15000 (Homo ergaster/erectus) in the reference collection. Twenty-nine homologous landmarks were measured for each clavicle. Variation and morphological similarities were assessed through principal component analysis, conducted separately for the complete clavicle and the diaphysis. On average, Neandertal clavicles had significantly larger muscular entheses, double dorsal curvature, clavicle torsion, and cranial orientation of the acromial end than non-Neandertal clavicles; the El Sidron clavicles fit this pattern. Variation within the samples was large, with extensive overlap between Homo species; only chimpanzee specimens clearly differed from the other specimens in morphometric terms. Taken together, our morphometric analyses are consistent with the following phylogenetic sequence. The primitive condition of the clavicle is manifest in the cranial orientation of both the acromial and sternal ends. The derived condition expressed in the H. sapiens + Neandertal clade is defined by caudal rotation of both the sternal and acromial ends, but with variation in the number of acromia remaining in a certain cranial orientation. Finally, the autapomorphic Neandertal condition is defined by secondarily acquired primitive cranial re-orientation of the acromial end, which varies from individual to individual. These results suggest that the pace of phylogenetic change in the pectoral girdle does not seem to follow that of other postcranial skeletal features.",3.733,132

Footedness entails postural asymmetry, and persons with mixed limb preferences often prefer the hand ipsilateral to the preferred foot in asymmetrical actions for which whole body postural adjustments are obligatory (e.g., throwing). The dichotic listening test , and indicator of language laterality, was administered to 4 groups of 48 persons with the 4 possible combinations of hand and foot preference.

We found that negative charge clusters (NCCs) are three to four times more frequent than positive charge clusters (PCCs). The Drosophila proteome is on average the most charged, whereas the human proteome is the least charged. Only 3 to 8% of the studied protein sequences have negative charge clusters, while 1.6 to 3% having PCCs and only 0.07 to 0.6% have both types of clusters.

Cognitive science,2014,"Human cultures educate children with different strategies. Ancient hunter-gatherers 200,000 years ago, with bodies and brains like our own, in bands of a hundred well-known individuals or less, depended on spontaneous cooperative practice of knowledge and skills in a natural world. Before creating language, they appreciated beautiful objects and music. Anthropologists observe that similar living cultures accept that children learn in playful 'intent participation'. Large modern industrial states with millions of citizens competing in a global economy aim to instruct young people in scientific concepts and the rules of literacy and numeracy deemed important for employment with elaborate machines. Our psychobiological theories commonly assume that an infant starts with a body needing care and emotional regulation and a mind that assimilates concepts of objects by sensorimotor action and requires school instruction in rational principles after several years of cognitive development. Evidence from archeology and evolutionary anthropology indicates that Homo sapiens are born with an imaginative and convivial brain ready for the pleasure of shared invention and with a natural sense of beauty in handmade objects and music. In short, there are innate predispositions for culture for practicing meaningful habits and artful performances that are playfully inventive and seductive for companionship in traditions, and soon capable of grasping the clever purpose of shared tasks and tools. This knowledge of inventive human nature with esthetic and moral sensibilities has important implications for educational policy in our schools.

The determination of the piriform aperture index (breadth/height) allowed the authors to demonstrate a marked elongation of the aperture in Homo compared with Gorilla and Pan. Individual characterization of the shape was possible with great precision and without ambiguity by using Fourier analysis. An absolute, interspecific partition between Gorilla, Pan, and Homo resulted from the canonical discriminant analysis of the Fourier descriptors. However, a closeness of shape between some individuals in Pan and some in Gorilla and Homo was observed, demonstrating a morphological continuum of the shape of the piriform aperture in hominoids: Pan was in intermediate position between Gorilla and Homo. Interspecific differences between Homo and the group Pan-Gorilla were explained principally by the differences in elongation (amplitude of the second harmonic) and pentagonality (amplitude of the fifth harmonic) and by differences in orientation of quadrangularity (phase of the fourth harmonic). Differences in the shape of the piriform aperture between Pan and Gorilla were explained by differences in orientation of elongation (phase of the second harmonic) and by differences in the component of triangularity (amplitude of the third harmonic). In Gorilla and Pan, the little, elongated, and relatively trapezoidal piriform aperture seems to be a shared primitive feature (plesiomorphic), whereas an elongated piriform aperture seems to be a characteristic and derived feature (apomorphic) of modern Homo sapiens.",2.379,236

Biological sciences / The Royal Society,2010,"Diminished bite force has been considered a defining feature of modern Homo sapiens, an interpretation inferred from the application of two-dimensional lever mechanics and the relative gracility of the human masticatory musculature and skull. This conclusion has various implications with regard to the evolution of human feeding behaviour. However, human dental anatomy suggests a capacity to withstand high loads and two-dimensional lever models greatly simplify muscle architecture, yielding less accurate results than three-dimensional modelling using multiple lines of action. Here, to our knowledge, in the most comprehensive three-dimensional finite element analysis performed to date for any taxon, we ask whether the traditional view that the bite of H. sapiens is weak and the skull too gracile to sustain high bite forces is supported. We further introduce a new method for reconstructing incomplete fossil material. Our findings show that the human masticatory apparatus is highly efficient, capable of producing a relatively powerful bite using low muscle forces. Thus, relative to other members of the superfamily Hominoidea, humans can achieve relatively high bite forces, while overall stresses are reduced. Our findings resolve apparently discordant lines of evidence, i.e. the presence of teeth well adapted to sustain high loads within a lightweight cranium and mandible.",0,1511

Genome data of three vertebrate species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Danio rerio), Caenorhabditis elegans, and two Drosophila species (Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura) were used. Duplication events were divided into six age-groups according to the synonymous distance (dS) up to 0.6. Duplogs were classified into four equal-sized classes on physical distances and into three classes on relative orientations. We observed the following shared characteristics among intrachromosomal multiexon duplogs: 1) inverted duplogs account for 20-50%, and about a half of the physically most distant 25%; 2) except for C. elegans, the composition of physical distances, that of relative orientations, and the proportion of inverted duplogs in each physical distance category are more or less uniform; 3) except for C. elegans, the characteristics of the youngest (dS < 0.01) duplogs are similar to the overall characteristics of the entire set. These results suggest that intrachromosomal duplogs with fairly long physical distances were generated at once, rather than resulting from tandem duplications and subsequent genomic rearrangements. This is different from the three well-known modes of gene duplication: tandem duplication, retrotransposition, and genome duplication. We termed this new mode as",4.229,1572

Using theoretical modeling techniques, general principles of host-pathogen system interactions can be explored and clinical treatment schedules can be optimized to lower the microbial toxin burden and side effects in the host system. In this study, we use a computational modeling technique that aims to explain the host-pathogen interactions and suggests how the host system tries to survive from the pathogen attack. The method generates data on reaction fluxes in a pathway at steady state. A set of constraints is incorporated and an objective function for the minimization of toxin expression, with respect to some parameters such as concentration of signaling molecules, is formulated. We have integrated the toxin expression regulatory pathway in Clostridium difficile, apoptosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in an infected host (Homo sapiens). We have found that due to the minimization of the toxin expression, the signal flow values for most of the survival genes are at the higher side, whereas it is the reverse for most of the proapoptotic genes. We have observed increased signal flow values of the molecules for extracellular regulated kinase as compared with the molecules present in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/p38 pathways. In light of these observations, we can hypothesize that lower toxin level in a pathogen implies higher chance of host survival.",3.081,284

Three-dimensional landmark data were digitized from subadult basicrania from seven populations. Published molecular data on short tandem repeats were statistically compared to morphological data from three ontogenetic stages. Basicranial and temporal bone morphology both reflect genetic distances in childhood and adolescence (5-18 years), but not in infancy (<5 years). The occipital bone reflects genetic distances only in adolescence (13-18 years). The sphenoid bone does not reflect genetic distances at any ontogenetic stage but was the most diagnostic region evaluated, resulting in high rates of correct classification among populations. These results suggest that the ontogenetic processes driving basicranial development are complex and cannot be succinctly summarized across populations or basicranial regions. However, the fact that certain regions reflect genetic distances suggests that the morphology of these regions may be useful in reconstructing population history in specimens for which direct DNA evidence is unavailable, such as archaeological sites.",1.579,65

METHODS: GST was purified through affinity chromatography (SdGST) and chacterized by SDS-PAGE and Nano-LC MS/MS analysis. Antibody isotypes to SdGST were measured by ELISA. Antibody dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was performed in vitro using sera from immunized animals and immune individuals. T-cell proliferation and cytokine response to SdGST in different groups of filariasis were measured. Immunoprophylactic potential of SdGST was evaluate in animal model. RESULTS: SdGST exhibited 30-fold enhancement of enzyme activity over crude parasitic extract. It was found to be 26 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Nano LC-MS/MS analysis followed by blast search showed 100% homology with Dirofilaria immitis (D. immitis) and only 43% with Homo sapiens (H. sapiens). Immunoblotting analysis showed putatively immune individuals carry significant level of antibodies to SdGST as compared with microfilaraemics. Immunized sera and sera endemic normal could neutralize the enzymatic activity of SdGST and inducing in vitro cytotoxicity of microfilariae. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from endemic normals upon stimulation with SdGST showed a mixed type of Th1/Th2 response.

GPCRs are the largest group of membrane receptor proteins encoded in the human genome. One of the most famous types of GPCRs is the opioid receptors. Opioid family receptors consist of four closely related proteins expressed in all vertebrate brains and spinal cords examined to date. The three classical types of opioid receptors shown unequivocally to mediate analgesia in animal models and in humans are the mu- (MOR), delta- (DOR), and kappa-(KOR) opioid receptor proteins. The fourth and most recent member of the opioid receptor family discovered is the nociceptin or orphanin FQ receptor (ORL). The role of ORL and its ligands in producing analgesia is not as clear, with both analgesic and hyperalgesic effects reported. All four opioid family receptor genes were cloned from expressed mRNA in a number of vertebrate species, and there are enough sequences presently available to carry out bioinformatic analysis. This chapter presents the results of a comparative analysis of vertebrate opioid receptors using pharmacological studies, bioinformatics, and the latest data from human whole-genome studies. Results confirm our initial hypotheses that the four opioid receptor genes most likely arose by whole-genome duplication, that there is an evolutionary vector of opioid receptor type divergence in sequence and function, and that the hMOR gene shows evidence of positive selection or adaptive evolution in Homo sapiens.",2.039,830

Haploinsufficiency is increasingly implicated in human disease, and so predicting this phenotype could provide insights into the genetic mechanisms behind many human diseases, including some cancers. RESULTS: In the present work we show that orthologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae HI genes are preferentially retained across the kingdom Fungi, and that the HI genes of S. cerevisiae can be used to predict haploinsufficiency in humans. Our HI gene predictions confirm known associations between haploinsufficiency and genetic disease, and predict several further disorders in which the phenotype may be relevant. Haploinsufficiency is also clearly relevant to the gene-dosage imbalances inherent in eukaryotic sex-determination systems. In S. cerevisiae, HI genes are over-represented on chromosome III, the chromosome that determines yeast's mating type. This may be a device to select against the loss of one copy of chromosome III from a diploid. We found that orthologues of S. cerevisiae HI genes are also over-represented on the mating-type chromosomes of other yeasts and filamentous fungi. In animals with heterogametic sex determination, accumulation of HI genes on the sex chromosomes would compromise fitness in both sexes, given X chromosome inactivation in females. We found that orthologues of S. cerevisiae HI genes are significantly under-represented on the X chromosomes of mammals and of Caenorhabditis elegans. There is no X inactivation in Drosophila melanogaster (increased expression of X in the male is used instead) and, in this species, we found no depletion of orthologues to yeast HI genes on the sex chromosomes. CONCLUSION: A special relationship between HI genes and the sex/mating-type chromosome extends from S. cerevisiae to Homo sapiens, with the microbe being a useful model for species throughout the evolutionary range. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency in yeast can predict the phenotype in higher organisms.",7.984,1509

Three-dimensional landmarks were digitized on an ontogenetic series of specimens of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. Data were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods, and shape changes throughout ontogeny in relation to size were compared. Results of these analyses indicate that, despite broadly similar patterns, African apes and humans show marked differences in development of the mandibular fossa and tympanic portions of the temporal bone.

To investigate the function of the yeast rpS5 and in particular the role of its N-terminal region, we obtained and characterized yeast strains in which the wild-type yeast rpS5 was replaced by its truncated variants, lacking 13, 24, 30 and 46 N-terminal amino acids, respectively. All mutant yeast strains were viable and displayed only moderately reduced growth rates, with the exception of the strain lacking 46 N-terminal amino acids, which had a doubling time of about 3 h. Biochemical analysis of the mutant yeast strains suggests that the N-terminal part of the eukaryotic and, in particular, yeast rpS5 may impact the ability of 40S subunits to function properly in translation and affect the efficiency of initiation, specifically the recruitment of initiation factors eIF3 and eIF2.",9.112,1799

Here we compare approximately 90 kb of coding DNA nucleotide sequence from 97 human genes to their sequenced chimpanzee counterparts and to available sequenced gorilla, orangutan, and Old World monkey counterparts, and, on a more limited basis, to mouse. The nonsynonymous changes (functionally important), like synonymous changes (functionally much less important), show chimpanzees and humans to be most closely related, sharing 99.4% identity at nonsynonymous sites and 98.4% at synonymous sites. On a time scale, the coding DNA divergencies separate the human-chimpanzee clade from the gorilla clade at between 6 and 7 million years ago and place the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees at between 5 and 6 million years ago. The evolutionary rate of coding DNA in the catarrhine clade (Old World monkey and ape, including human) is much slower than in the lineage to mouse. Among the genes examined, 30 show evidence of positive selection during descent of catarrhines. Nonsynonymous substitutions by themselves, in this subset of positively selected genes, group humans and chimpanzees closest to each other and have chimpanzees diverge about as much from the common human-chimpanzee ancestor as humans do. This functional DNA evidence supports two previously offered taxonomic proposals: family Hominidae should include all extant apes; and genus Homo should include three extant species and two subgenera, Homo (Homo) sapiens (humankind), Homo (Pan) troglodytes (common chimpanzee), and Homo (Pan) paniscus (bonobo chimpanzee).",9.674,1125

20035967,A bivariate approach to the widening of the frontal lobes in the genus Homo.,"['Bruner E', 'Holloway RL']",Journal of human evolution,2010,"Within the genus Homo, the most encephalized taxa (Neandertals and modern humans) show relatively wider frontal lobes than either Homo erectus or australopithecines. The present analysis considers whether these changes are associated with a single size-based or allometric pattern (positive allometry of the width of the anterior endocranial fossa) or with a more specific and non-allometric pattern. The relationship between hemispheric length, maximum endocranial width, and frontal width at Broca's area was investigated in extant and extinct humans. Our results do not support positive allometry for the frontal lobe's width in relation to the main endocranial diameters within modern humans (Homo sapiens). Also, the correlation between frontal width and hemispheric length is lower than the correlation between frontal width and parieto-temporal width. When compared with the australopithecines, the genus Homo could have experienced a non-allometric widening of the brain at the temporo-parietal areas, which is most evident in Neandertals. Modern humans and Neandertals also display a non-allometric widening of the anterior endocranial fossa at the Broca's cap when compared with early hominids, again more prominent in the latter group. Taking into account the contrast between the intra-specific patterns and the between-species differences, the relative widening of the anterior fossa can be interpreted as a definite evolutionary character instead of a passive consequence of brain size increase. This expansion is most likely associated with correspondent increments of the underlying neural mass, or at least with a geometrical reallocation of the frontal cortical volumes. Although different structural changes of the cranial architecture can be related to such variations, the widening of the frontal areas is nonetheless particularly interesting when some neural functions (like language or working memory, decision processing, etc.) and related fronto-parietal cortico-cortical connections are taken into account.",3.733,1051

Therefore, investigation of variations in miR-155 could be useful for understanding the differences in immunity between individuals. In this study, four SNPs in miR-155 were identified in mice (Mus musculus) and humans (Homo sapiens). In mice, the four SNPs were closely linked and formed two miR-155 haplotypes (A and B). Ten distinct types of blood parameters were associated with miR-155 expression under normal conditions. Additionally, 4 and 14 blood parameters were significantly different between these two genotypes under normal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation conditions, respectively. Moreover, the expression levels of miR-155, the inflammatory response to LPS stimulation, and the lethal ratio following Salmonella typhimurium infection were significantly increased in mice harboring the AA genotype. Further, two SNPs, one in the loop region and the other near the 3' terminal of pre-miR-155, were confirmed to be responsible for the differential expression of miR-155 in mice. Interestingly, two additional SNPs, one in the loop region and the other in the middle of miR-155*, modulated the function of miR-155 in humans. Predictions of secondary RNA structure using RNAfold showed that these SNPs affected the structure of miR-155 in both mice and humans. Our results provide novel evidence of the natural functional SNPs of miR-155 in both mice and humans, which may affect the expression levels of mature miR-155 by modulating its secondary structure. The SNPs of human miR-155 may be considered as causal mutations for some immune-related diseases in the clinic.

We tried to evaluate the possibility that levels of Homo sapiens microRNA-214 (hsa-miR-214) in hair roots or hair shafts can be a useful marker of the disease. METHODS: A single hair root and five pieces of hair shafts were obtained from nine patients with dermatomyositis, 15 normal subjects, and 18 patients with scleroderma before treatment. RNAs were purified from the hair roots and hair shafts using commercially available kits. cDNA was synthesized from the RNA, and miR-214 levels were measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of hair microRNA levels. RESULTS: The levels of miR-214 in hair shafts of patients with dermatomyositis were significantly higher than those of normal subjects and patients with scleroderma. By receiver operator curve analysis of hair shaft miR-214 levels to distinguish patients with dermatomyositis from normal subjects, the area under the curve was 0.90. The duration between symptom onset and the first visit to the hospital was significantly shorter in patients with elevated hair shafts miR-214 levels, suggesting that they have more severe subjective symptoms. On the other hand, we could not find significant differences in hair root miR-214 levels among normal subjects and patients with dermatomyositis and scleroderma.

For all species (chickadee and humans here, pigeons previously), chords with half-step alterations in the 5th note were easier to discriminate than half-step manipulations of the 3rd note, which is likely due to the sensory consonance of these chords.

Based on metric data (crown and cervical outline analysis, and lateral enamel thickness) and non-metric dental traits (e.g., mid-trigonid crest), Fumane 1 (lower left second deciduous molar) clearly belongs to a Neandertal. For Fumane 4 (upper right central deciduous incisor), the taxonomic attribution is difficult due to heavy incisal wear. Some morphological features observed in Fumane 5 (lower right lateral deciduous incisor), coupled with the large size of the tooth, support Neandertal affinity.

Foxc2 lentiviral plasmid, pGC-LV, pHelperl.0, and pHelper2.0 were co-transfected into 293T cells to obtain recombinant virus containing Foxc2 gene. The lentiviral titer was detected. BMSCs were isolated from bone marrow of rabbit and infected with Foxc2 recombined lentiviral, then the optimum multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined by detecting the intensity of fluorescence expression. The expression of Foxc2 in the infected BMSCs was determined at 1, 3, and 7 days after transfection by inverted fluorescence microscope and Western blot. After osteogenic induction, Alizarin red staining was done to observe the formation of mineralized nodule. RESULTS: The Foxc2 recombinant lentiviral vector was constructed and was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing analysis. It could efficiently transfect 293T cells and express in 293T cells. The lentiviral titer was 2 x 10(8) TU/mL. The optimum MOI was 200. The inverted fluorescence microscope observation showed that the Foxc2 gene expressed in 84.5% +/-4.8% of infected BMSCs at 3 days after transfection.

The contribution of science and technology to this evolutionary process is probably the first to come to mind. The biology of Homo sapiens permits and promotes the development of technologies and artefacts that enable us to sense and reach physical niches previously inaccessible. This extends our biological capabilities, but is also expected to create selective pressures on these capabilities. The jury is yet out on the pace at which critical biological changes take place in evolution. There is no question, however, that the kinetics of technological and cultural change is much faster, rendering the latter particularly important in the biography of the individual and the species alike. The capacity of art to enrich human capabilities is recurrently discussed by philosophers and critics (e.g., Arsitotle/Poetics, Richards, 1925; Smith and Parks, 1951; Gibbs, 1994). Yet less attention is commonly allotted to the role of the arts in the aforementioned ongoing evolutional tango. My position is that the art of cinema is particularly suited to explore the intriguing dialogue between art and the brain.

Due to the deficiency of protective shield like enzyme; melanin, albinos are at an increased peril for melanoma and other skin cancers. So, computational and residue-level insight including a mutational exploration with evolutionary importance into this mechanism lies obligatory for future pathological and therapeutic developments. Therefore, functional tertiary models of the relevant proteins were analyzed after satisfying their stereo-chemical features. Evolutionarily paramount residues for the activation of tyrosinase were perceived via multiple sequence alignment phenomena. Mutant-type tyrosinase protein (S98A and S102A) was thereby modeled, maintaining the wild-type proteins' functionality. Furthermore, this present comparative study discloses the variation in the stable residual participation (for mutant-type and wild-type tyrosinase-PKCbeta complex). Mainly, an increased number of polar negatively charged residues from the wild-type tyrosinase participated with PKC-beta, predominantly.

Evolutionary history helps to understand the adaptation of diet and its nutritional implications. Anatomical and behavioral changes linked to changing dietary patterns in the Paleolithic resulted in an adaptive framework that affects modern diet. The evolution of an expanding brain, a shrinking large intestine, and lengthening small intestine necessitated a demand for nutritionally dense foods. The key to these changes is an understanding of the response to the omnivore's dilemma. Omnivores in their search for new items to feed their varied diet (neophilia) have a challenge when they fear (neophobia) novel items that may be poisonous and can cause death. The inborn mechanism initiates palate fatigue (sensory-specific satiety) ensuring a variety of foods will be eaten. Variety will limit the impact of toxins ingested and provide a more balanced diet. The development of cuisine, a momentous event in history, mediated the conflict, and changed the course of human evolution. The cuisine, a biocultural construct, defines which items found in nature are edible, how these products are transformed into food, the flavors used to add a sensory dimension to foods, and rules of eating or etiquette.

In order to determine whether NPCs could rescue tau related neuronal cell death NPCs were transplanted into the transgenic mouse cortex of transgenic mice expressing human P301S tau protein at 2 month of age and the effect followed 2 and 3 months after transplantation. The results demonstrated that following transplantation mouse NPCs differentiated into astrocytes and exerted a neuroprotective effect. In particular, the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor was increased near the transplanted cells. A nonsignificant increase of brain derived neurotrophic factor expression was instead found in the area of the cortex where neuronal death was rescued.",1.488,1506

As predicted by this hypothesis, right-handed pitchers were more successful (i.e., opposing batters hit more poorly against them) when they were relatively rare in the population. Contrary to the predictions of this hypothesis, however, left-handed pitchers were more successful when they were relatively common. Both right- and left-handed batters performed better in years dominated by right-handed pitchers, despite the fact that right-handed batters perform relatively poorly against right-handed pitchers. I suggest that batters form cognitive representations based on pitcher handedness, and that these representations are strengthened by repeated exposure or priming. When the pitcher handedness polymorphism is more balanced (e.g., 67% right-handed, 33% left-handed), these cognitive representations are less effective, which leads to decreased batting averages and improved performance by all pitchers. Furthermore, these cognitive representations are likely to be more critical to the success of right-handed hitters, who have reduced visuomotor skills relative to left-handed hitters.",1.52,476

Anthrax has been practised as biological weapon because of two attributes: i) short duration of spore germination, and ii) lethal toxaemia of the vegetative stage. Pathogenesis is caused by the activity of edema toxin and lethal toxin. Protective antigen (PA), is an essential component of both complexes, binds to Anthrax Toxin Receptor (ATR) and mediates the lethality in mammals. The combination of vaccine and antibiotics are preferred to be effective treatment for destruction of the vegetative cell wall but could not be a successive destructor for endospores. So the present study is intended to identify the small molecules as a potential inhibitor for ATR1. 3D structure of Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1 (ATR1) was built by using the crystal structure of Anthrax Toxin Receptor 2 (ATR2) from Homo sapiens as template. Molecular docking of 6-thiogunaosine (6-TG) analogs was performed on the ATR1 model and effective inhibitor was selected based on the docking results. The docking results showed that the three residues in the ATR1 binding pocket (Phe162, Asp160, and Phe22) were essential for making hydrogen bond with the 2-(2-bromo-6-chloro-4H-purin-9(5H)-yl)- 5-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diol (C(11)H(13)N(3)O(5)).

Due to the importance of memory and learning in our species, it has been suggested that the synaptic plasticity in a number of association areas is higher in the human brain than in other primates. Cortical neurons in mammals are characterized by higher metabolism, activity, and synaptic plasticity during development and the juvenile stage than in the adult. In Homo sapiens, brain development is retarded compared with other primates, especially in some association areas. These areas are characterized by the presence of neurons, which remain structurally immature throughout their lifespans and show an increase in the expression of the genes, which deal with metabolism and the activity and synaptic plasticity in adulthood. The retention of juvenile features in some adult neurons in our species has occurred in areas, which are related to episodic memory, planning, and social navigation. The increase of the aerobic metabolism in these neurons may lead, however, to higher levels of oxidative stress, therefore, favoring the development of neurodegenerative diseases which are exclusive, or almost exclusive, to humans, such as Alzheimer's disease.",1.204,1431

Evidence for the involvement of myosin motors has been described in many systems, and until recently a candidate mitochondrial myosin transport motor had not been described in vertebrates. Myosin-XIX (MYO19) was predicted to represent a novel class of myosin and had previously been shown to bind to mitochondria and increase mitochondrial network dynamics when ectopically expressed. Our analyses comparing  approximately 40 MYO19 orthologs to  approximately 2000 other myosin motor domain sequences identified instances of homology well-conserved within class XIX myosins that were not found in other myosin classes, suggesting MYO19-specific mechanochemistry. Steady-state biochemical analyses of the MYO19 motor domain indicate that Homo sapiens MYO19 is a functional motor. Insect cell-expressed constructs bound calmodulin as a light chain at the predicted stoichiometry and displayed actin-activated ATPase activity. MYO19 constructs demonstrated high actin affinity in the presence of ATP in actin-co-sedimentation assays, and translocated actin filaments in gliding assays. Expression of GFP-MYO19 containing a mutation impairing ATPase activity did not enhance mitochondrial network dynamics, as occurs with wild-type MYO19, indicating that myosin motor activity is required for mitochondrial motility. The measured biochemical properties of MYO19 suggest it is a high-duty ratio motor that could serve to transport mitochondria or anchor mitochondria, depending upon the cellular microenvironment.",0,1137

RESULTS: To obtain a global view of human genomic evolution, we quantify the divergence of proteins by functional category at different evolutionary distances from human. CONCLUSION: This analysis highlights some general systems-level characteristics of human evolution: regulatory processes, such as signal transducers, transcription factors and receptors, have a high degree of plasticity, while core processes, such as metabolism, transport and protein synthesis, are largely conserved. Additionally, this study reveals a dynamic picture of selective forces at short, medium and long evolutionary timescales. Certain functional categories, such as 'development' and 'organogenesis', exhibit temporal patterns of sequence divergence in eukaryotes relative to human. This framework for a grammar of human evolution supports previously postulated theories of robustness and evolvability.",10.81,519

This study was intended to clarify the correlation between the existence of K-ras oncogene and the pathological features of colorectal adenomas using our recently developed membrane arrays. Moreover, the downstream genes regulated by K-ras oncogene were explored to serve as potential biomarkers in the early diagnosis and risk assessment of patients with colorectal adenoma. Specimens were collected from 70 patients with colorectal adenoma. The alterations of K-ras oncogene were analyzed by direct sequencing and our constructed membrane arrays, respectively. The results of direct sequencing showed that 21 of 70 samples (30%) had K-ras gene mutations. The most frequently mutated sites included codons 12, 13, 15 and 18. Furthermore, activated K-ras oncogene was identified in 18 of 70 (25.7%) adenoma by membrane arrays. Statistical analyses showed that the membrane array had the accuracy of 90.0%, sensitivity of 88.9%, and specificity of 90.4%. The frequency of the mutational sites of K-ras gene was located as follows: codon 12, 100% (4/4); codon 13, 100% (4/4); codon 15, 75% (6/8); and codon 18, 100% (2/2). The analysis of the correlation between the experimental data and pathological characteristics of adenoma showed that activated K-ras oncogenes were significantly associated with the size, number and histology of adenomas (all P<0.001). Finally, we found the downstream genes activated by K-ras oncogene, including B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), Homo sapiens H2A histone family, member Z (H2AFZ), Homo sapiens RAP1B, member of RAS oncogene family (RAP1B), Homo sapiens T-box 19 (TBX19), Homo sapiens E2F transcription factor 4, p107/p130-binding (E2F4) and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), of which were overexpressed in most of all examined adenomas. These genes were then suggested to have functions involved in cell growth. The preliminary results indicated that the accuracy of membrane arrays was comparable to conventional DNA sequencing in the detection of activated K-ras oncogenes.

These theories are considered in relation to the central paradox that psychosis is associated with a substantial biological disadvantage. Annett's heterozygote advantage hypothesis critically identified lateralization as a major determinant of ability, but it appears that what is inherited is degrees (as suggested by Yeo et al.) rather than (or as well as) direction of lateralization. Relative hand skill has been shown (Crow, T.J., Crow, L.R., Done, D.J., Leask, S.J., 1998. Relative hand skill predicts academic ability: global deficits at the point of hemispheric indecision. Neuropsychologia 36, 1275-1282.) to be a powerful predictor (interacting with sex) of academic ability but the greatest region of vulnerability (that includes reading disability and predisposition to psychosis) is close to the point of equal hand skill ('hemispheric indecision'). In contrast with Annett's single locus, Yeo's polygenic and Klar's strand-segregation hypotheses, each of which postulates an autosomal locus or loci, the hypothesis of a single gene for asymmetry located in a sex-specific region of homology on both X and Y chromosomes can account for sex differences, as observed in age of onset, and premorbid precursors of psychosis, as well as differences in the general population in relation to degrees of hand skill, verbal ability and cerebral asymmetry. The evolutionarily recent transposition to, and subsequent paracentric inversion in, the Y chromosome short arm of a 4-Mb block from Xq21.3 (the proximal long arm of the X) are candidates for speciation events in the lineage that led to Homo sapiens. A gene associated with a range of variation (that may be due to a high mutation site, or perhaps to epigenetic modification) on the Y that overlaps with, but differs quantitatively from, that on the X may explain the sex differences associated with psychosis, and may be relevant to its persistence. Such a gene could be the principal determinant in Man of the rate of brain growth, as suggested by Saugstad and by the findings of a recent study of adolescent onset psychosis (James, A., Crow, T.J., Renowden, S., Wardell, M., Smith, D.M., Anslow, P., in press.

The study of these interactions has provided insight into the functioning of an organism's processes. As of October 2013, Homo sapiens had over 170000 Protein-Protein interactions (PPI) registered in the Interologous Interaction Database, which is only one of the many public resources where protein interactions can be accessed. These numbers exemplify the volume of data that research on the topic has generated. Visualization of large data sets is a well known strategy to make sense of information, and protein interaction data is no exception. There are several tools that allow the exploration of this data, providing different methods to visualize protein network interactions. However, there is still no native web tool that allows this data to be explored interactively online. RESULTS: Given the advances that web technologies have made recently it is time to bring these interactive views to the web to provide an easily accessible forum to visualize PPI. We have created a Web-based Protein Interaction Network Visualizer: PINV, an open source, native web application that facilitates the visualization of protein interactions (http://biosual.cbio.uct.ac.za/pinv.html). We developed PINV as a set of components that follow the protocol defined in BioJS and use the D3 library to create the graphic layouts. We demonstrate the use of PINV with multi-organism interaction networks for a predicted target from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, its interacting partners and its orthologs.

This theory proposes that anatomically modern humans--which were only present in Africa at the time--experienced a drastic bottleneck during the penultimate glacial age (130-190 kya) when a cold and dry climate prevailed. Two scenarios have been proposed to describe the bottleneck, which involve either a fragmentation of the range occupied by humans or the survival of one small group of humans. Here, we analyze DNA sequence data from 61 nuclear loci sequenced in three African populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation and numerical simulations. In contrast to the bottleneck theory, we show that a simple model without any bottleneck during the penultimate ice age has the greatest statistical support compared with bottleneck models. Although the proposed bottleneck is ancient, occurring at least 130 kya, we can discard the possibility that it did not leave detectable footprints in the DNA sequence data except if the bottleneck involves a less than a 3-fold reduction in population size. Finally, we confirm that a simple model without a bottleneck is able to reproduce the main features of the observed patterns of genetic variation. We conclude that models of Pleistocene refugium for modern human origins now require substantial revision.",9.105,1274

Part of this debate can be attributed to the absence of certain detailed quantitative data distinguishing human and great ape forefoot form and function. The aim of this study is to quantitatively test previous observations that human metatarsophalangeal joints exhibit greater amounts of dorsal excursion (i.e., dorsiflexion) than those of Pan at the terminal stance phase of terrestrial locomotion. Video recordings were made in order to measure sagittal excursions of the medial metatarsophalangeal joints in habitually shod/unshod adult humans and adult bonobos (Pan paniscus). Results indicate that the human first and second metatarsophalangeal joints usually dorsiflex more than those of bonobos. When timing of maximum excursion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is coupled with existing plantar pressure data, the unique role of the human forefoot as a key site of leverage and weight transmission is highlighted.

The gene encoding Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nmt1p (NMT1) is essential for vegetative growth. Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum are the principal causes of systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised humans. Metabolic labeling studies indicate that they synthesize a small set of cellular N-myristoylproteins during exponential growth on rich media, the most prominent of which co-migrate with two essential functionally interchangeable S. cerevisiae N-myristoylproteins, ADP ribosylation factor-1 (Arf1p) and Arf2p. NMT and ARF genes have been recovered from C. neoformans and H. capsulatum using the polymerase chain reaction. They are single copy genes, interrupted by multiple introns. C. neoformans and H. capsulatum Nmts have approximately 50% amino acid sequence identity with the orthologous S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and Homo sapiens N-myristoyltransferases, whereas C. neoformans and H. capsulatum Arfs are approximately 80% identical with C. albicans Arf and S. cerevisiae Arf1p and Arf2p. Functional studies of C. neoformans and C. albicans Nmts conducted in Escherichia coli reveal that (i) both efficiently acylate S. cerevisiae Arf2p; (ii) C. neoformans Arf is a substrate for C. neoformans Nmt; and (iii) substitution of an Asp for a Gly located 5 residues from the C terminus of these two enzymes causes marked temperature-dependent reductions in their catalytic efficiency, just as it does with S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens Nmts. Wild type C. neoformans, C. albicans, and H. sapiens NMTs can fully complement the lethal phenotype of a S. cerevisiae nmt1 null allele at 24 and 37 degrees C when the GAL1-10 promoter controlling their expression is induced by galactose. Only the C. albicans enzyme is able to do so when the promoter is repressed with glucose. This complementation profile likely arises, at least in part, from differences in the protein substrate specificities of the orthologous Nmts. A Gly-->Asp mutation in S. cerevisiae, C. neoformans, C. albicans, and H. sapiens Nmts produces temperature-sensitive growth arrest in isogenic S. cerevisiae strains with a nmt1 null allele.

Significant numbers of high-resolution crystal structures of glycosylated proteins allow us to carry out structural analysis of the N-linked glycosylation sites (NGS). Our analysis shows that there is enough structural information from diverse glycoproteins to allow the development of rules which can be used to predict NGS. A Python-based tool was developed to investigate asparagines implicated in N-glycosylation in five species: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our analysis shows that 78% of all asparagines of NXS/T motif involved in N-glycosylation are localized in the loop/turn conformation in the human proteome. Similar distribution was revealed for all the other species examined. Comparative analysis of the occurrence of NXS/T motifs not known to be glycosylated and their reverse sequence (S/TXN) shows a similar distribution across the secondary structural elements, indicating that the NXS/T motif in itself is not biologically relevant.

In the first experiment, subjects performed visual searches for a moving target among stationary items, and for a stationary target among moving items. Subjects of both species displayed an advantage in detecting the moving item compared to the stationary one, suggesting the priority of movement in the attentional processing. A second experiment assessed the effect of the coherent movement of items in the search for a stationary target. Facilitative effects of motion coherence were observed only in the performance of human subjects. In the third and fourth experiments, the effect of coherent movement of the reference frame on the search for moving and stationary targets was tested. Related target movements significantly influenced the search performance of both species.

We studied the interaction between human-inducible HSP70 and Homo sapiens J-domain protein (HSJ1a), a J domain and UIM motif-containing co-chaperone. The J domain of HSJ1a shares a conserved structure with other J domains from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, and it mediates the interaction with and the ATPase cycle of HSP70. Our in vitro study corroborates that the N terminus of HSP70 including the ATPase domain and the substrate-binding beta-subdomain is not sufficient to bind with the J domain of HSJ1a. The C-terminal helical alpha-subdomain of HSP70, which was considered to function as a lid of the substrate-binding domain, is crucial for binding with the J domain of HSJ1a and stimulating the ATPase activity of HSP70. These fluctuating helices are likely to contribute to a proper conformation of HSP70 for J-domain binding other than directly bind with the J domain. Our findings provide an alternative mechanism of allosteric activation for functional regulation of HSP70 by its J-domain co-chaperones.",0,1369

In this study, the ADAMs of Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens were collected and analyzed by using the Bayesian analysis and gene synteny analysis to establish a comprehensive phylogenetic relationship and evolutionary drive of this gene family. It was found that there were more ADAMs in the two rodents than in the amphibian, suggesting an expansion of the ADAM gene family during the early evolution of mammals. All ADAMs from this expansion were retained in both the rodents, but other duplication events occurred subsequently in the two rodents, respectively, leading to the classification of rodent ADAMs as classes I, II and III. Moreover, these duplicated ADAM genes in the rodents were found to be driven by positive selection, which might be the major force to retain them in the genome. Importantly, it was also found that orthologs of ADAM3 and 5 have been lost in humans. These results not only provide valuable information of the evolution of ADAM genes, but may also help in understanding the role of ADAM genes in the pathobiology of relevant diseases.",2.138,109

We functionally characterized the iron-sulfur protein required for NADH dehydrogenase (INDH) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. An indh knockout mutant lacked complex I but had low levels of a 650-kD assembly intermediate, similar to mutations in the homologous NUBPL (nucleotide binding protein-like) in Homo sapiens. However, heterozygous indh/+ mutants displayed unusual phenotypes during gametogenesis and resembled mutants in mitochondrial translation more than mutants in complex I. Gradually increased expression of INDH in indh knockout plants revealed a significant delay in reassembly of complex I, suggesting an indirect role for INDH in the assembly process. Depletion of INDH protein was associated with decreased (35)S-Met labeling of translation products in isolated mitochondria, whereas the steady state levels of several mitochondrial transcripts were increased. Mitochondrially encoded proteins were differentially affected, with near normal levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit2 and Nad7 but little Nad6 protein in the indh mutant.

Resolution of this debate is crucial to interpretations of the significance of morphological variation within terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene Australian skeletal materials and claims of a regional evolutionary sequence linking Javan Homo erectus and Australian Homo sapiens. However, morphological comparisons of terminal Pleistocene and recent Australian crania are complicated by the significantly greater average body mass in the former. Raw and size-adjusted metric comparisons of the terminal Pleistocene skeleton from Nacurrie, south-eastern Australia, with modified and unmodified H. sapiens and H. erectus, identified a suite of traits in the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones associated with intentional modification of a neonate's skull. These traits are also present in some of the crania from Kow Swamp and Coobool Creek, which are in close geographic proximity to Nacurrie, but not in unmodified H. sapiens or Javan H. erectus. Frontal bone morphology in H. erectus was distinct from all of the Australian H. sapiens samples. During the first six months of life, Nacurrie's vault may have been shaped by his mother's hands, rather than though the application of fixed bandages. Whether this behaviour persisted only for several generations, or hundreds of years, remains unknown. The reasons behind the shaping of Nacurrie's head, aesthetics or otherwise, and why this cultural practice was adopted and subsequently discontinued, will always remain a matter of speculation.",3.733,1417

In this study, we screened and detected the expression of LncRNA in two NSCLC lines 95D and 95C by using high throughput LncRNA chip. We found that TATDN1 (Homo sapiens TatD DNase domain containing 1, TATDN1), one of LncRNAs, was highly expressed in 95D cells and NSCLC tumor tissues compared to 95C cells. Knockdown of TATDN1-1 by shRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion in 95D cells. Further mechanism study showed that TATDN1 knockdown suppressed the expression of E-cadherin, HER2, beta-catenin and Ezrin. Moreover, knockdown TATDN1 also inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a 95D mouse model in vivo by inhibiting beta-catenin and Ezrin. These data indicate that TATDN1 expression is associated with 95D cells' higher potential of invasion and metastasis, and suggest that TATDN1 may be a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target for NSCLCs.",6.359,683

We cloned for the first time the full coding sequence of camel's lysosomal acid lipase, cLIPA using RT-PCR technique (Genbank accession numbers JF803951 and AEG75815, for the nucleotide and aminoacid sequences respectively). The cDNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,197 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 399 aminoacids which was similar to that from other related mammalian species. Bioinformatic analysis was used to determine the aminoacid sequence, 3D structure and phylogeny of cLIPA. Bioinformatics analysis suggested the molecular weight of the translated protein to be 45.57 kDa, which could be decreased to 43.16 kDa after the removal of a signal peptide comprising the first 21 aminoacids. The deduced cLIPA sequences exhibited high identity with Equus caballus (86%), Numascus leucogenys (85%), Homo sapiens (84%), Sus scrofa (84%), Bos taurus (82%) and Ovis aries (81%). cLIPA shows high aminoacid sequence identity with human and dog-gastric lipases (58%, and 59% respectively) which makes it relevant to build a 3D structure model for cLIPA. The omparison confirms the presence of the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole in cLIPA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that camel cLIPA is grouped with monkey, human, pig, cow and goat. The level of expression of cLIPA in five camel tissues was examined using Real Time-PCR.

Among these mechanisms, Nonsense-mediated Decay (NMD) is a quality control process that detects post-transcriptionally abnormal transcripts and leads them to degradation. The UPF1 protein lays at the heart of NMD as shown by several structural and functional features reported for this factor mainly for Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This process is highly conserved in eukaryotes but functional diversity can be observed in various species. Ustilago maydis is a basidiomycete and the best-known smut, which has become a model to study molecular and cellular eukaryotic mechanisms. In this study, we performed in silico analysis to investigate the structural and biochemical properties of the putative UPF1 homolog in Ustilago maydis. The putative homolog for UPF1 was recognized in the annotated genome for the basidiomycete, exhibiting 66% identity with its human counterpart at the protein level. The known structural and functional domains characteristic of UPF1 homologs were also found. Based on the crystal structures available for UPF1, we constructed different three-dimensional models for umUPF1 in order to analyze the secondary and tertiary structural features of this factor. Using these models, we studied the spatial arrangement of umUPF1 and its capability to interact with UPF2. Moreover, we identified the critical amino acids that mediate the interaction of umUPF1 with UPF2, ATP, RNA and with UPF1 itself. Mutating these amino acids in silico showed an important effect over the native structure. Finally, we performed molecular dynamic simulations for UPF1 proteins from H. sapiens and U. maydis and the results obtained show a similar behavior and physicochemical properties for the protein in both organisms. Overall, our results indicate that the putative UPF1 identified in U. maydis shows a very similar sequence, structural organization, mechanical stability, physicochemical properties and spatial organization in comparison to the NMD factor depicted for Homo sapiens. These observations strongly support the notion that human and fungal UPF1 could perform equivalent biological activities.",3.234,255

These reads are then used for several applications, e.g., sequence reconstruction, DNA assembly, gene expression profiling, mutation analysis. METHODS: We propose a method to evaluate the similarity between reads. This method does not rely on the alignment of the reads and it is based on the distance between the frequencies of their substrings of fixed dimensions (k-mers). We compare this alignment-free distance with the similarity measures derived from two alignment methods: Needleman-Wunsch and Blast. The comparison is based on a simple assumption: the most correct distance is obtained by knowing in advance the reference sequence. Therefore, we first align the reads on the original DNA sequence, compute the overlap between the aligned reads, and use this overlap as an ideal distance. We then verify how the alignment-free and the alignment-based distances reproduce this ideal distance. The ability of correctly reproducing the ideal distance is evaluated over samples of read pairs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Homo sapiens. The comparison is based on the correctness of threshold predictors cross-validated over different samples. RESULTS: We exhibit experimental evidence that the proposed alignment-free distance is a potentially useful read-to-read distance measure and performs better than the more time consuming distances based on alignment. CONCLUSIONS: Alignment-free distances may be used effectively for reads comparison, and may provide a significant speed-up in several processes based on NGS sequencing (e.g., DNA assembly, reads classification).",0,870

In particular, we have analyzed base composition, periodicity and information content in sets of aligned promoters clustered according to functional information in order to obtain an insight on the main structural differences between promoters regulating genes with different functions. Our results show that when we select promoters according to some biological information, in a single species, at least in vertebrates, we observe structurally different classes of sequences.

As test of concept, we applied a new chemical genomics approach to uncover additional targets for the widely prescribed lipid-lowering pro-drug simvastatin. We used mRNA extracted from internal mammary artery from patients undergoing coronary artery surgery to prepare a viral cardiovascular protein library, using T7 bacteriophage. We then studied interactions of clones of the bacteriophage, each expressing a different cardiovascular polypeptide, with surface-bound simvastatin in 96-well plates. To maximise likelihood of identifying meaningful interactions between simvastatin and vascular peptides, we used a validated photo-immobilisation method to apply a series of different chemical linkers to bind simvastatin so as to present multiple orientations of its constituent components to potential targets. Three rounds of biopanning identified consistent interaction with the clone expressing part of the gene GJC3, which maps to Homo sapiens chromosome 7, and codes for gap junction gamma-3 protein, also known as connexin 30.2/31.3 (mouse connexin Cx29). Further analysis indicated the binding site to be for the N-terminal domain putatively 'regulating' connexin hemichannel and gap junction pores. Using immunohistochemistry we found connexin 30.2/31.3 to be present in samples of artery similar to those used to prepare the bacteriophage library. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that a 25 amino acid synthetic peptide representing the discovered N-terminus did not interact with simvastatin lactone, but did bind to the hydrolysed HMG CoA inhibitor, simvastatin acid. This interaction was also seen for fluvastatin. The gap junction blockers carbenoxolone and flufenamic acid also interacted with the same peptide providing insight into potential site of binding.

26124540,A Proposed Neurological Interpretation of Language Evolution.,['Ardila A'],Behavioural neurology,2015,"Since the very beginning of the aphasia history it has been well established that there are two major aphasic syndromes (Wernicke's-type and Broca's-type aphasia); each one of them is related to the disturbance at a specific linguistic level (lexical/semantic and grammatical) and associated with a particular brain damage localization (temporal and frontal-subcortical). It is proposed that three stages in language evolution could be distinguished: (a) primitive communication systems similar to those observed in other animals, including nonhuman primates; (b) initial communication systems using sound combinations (lexicon) but without relationships among the elements (grammar); and (c) advanced communication systems including word-combinations (grammar). It is proposed that grammar probably originated from the internal representation of actions, resulting in the creation of verbs; this is an ability that depends on the so-called Broca's area and related brain networks. It is suggested that grammar is the basic ability for the development of so-called metacognitive executive functions. It is concluded that while the lexical/semantic language system (vocabulary) probably appeared during human evolution long before the contemporary man (Homo sapiens sapiens), the grammatical language historically represents a recent acquisition and is correlated with the development of complex cognition (metacognitive executive functions).",1.445,713

A genome-wide strategy was used in this investigation to identify and characterize novel and low-nitrogen (N)-responsive lncRNAs in Populus tomentosa; 388 unique lncRNA candidates belonging to 380 gene loci were detected and only seven lncRNAs were found to belong to seven conserved non-coding RNA families indicating the majority of P. tomentosa lncRNAs are species-specific. In total, 126 lncRNAs were significantly altered under low-N stress; 8 were repressed, and 118 were induced. Furthermore, 9 and 5 lncRNAs were detected as precursors of 11 known and 14 novel Populus miRNAs, respectively, whereas 4 lncRNAs were targeted by 29 miRNAs belonging to 5 families, including 22 conserved and 7 non-conserved miRNAs. In addition, 15 antisense lncRNAs were identified to be generated from opposite strands of 14 corresponding protein-coding genes. In total, 111 protein-coding genes with regions complementary to 38 lncRNAs were also predicted with some lncRNAs corresponding to multiple genes and vice versa, and their functions were annotated, which further demonstrated the complex regulatory relationship between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in plants. Moreover, an interaction network among lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs was investigated. These findings enrich our understanding of lncRNAs in Populus, expand the methods of miRNA identification.

To date, the activities of the key enzymes (AIP synthase, PIP synthase) have been confirmed in only three genera (two archaeal genera, Methanothermobacter and Pyrococcus, and one bacterial genus, Mycobacterium). In the present study, we demonstrated that this novel biosynthetic pathway is universal in both Archaea and Bacteria, which contain inositol phospholipid, and elucidate the specificity of PIP synthase and AIP synthase for lipid substrates. PIP and AIP synthase activity were confirmed in all recombinant cells transformed with the respective gene constructs for four bacterial species (Streptomyces avermitilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Rhodococcus equi) and two archaeal species (Aeropyrum pernix and Sulfolobus solfataricus). Inositol was not incorporated. CDP-ArOH was used as the substrate for PIP synthase in Bacteria, and CDP-DAG was used as the substrate for AIP synthase in Archaea, despite their fundamentally different structures. PI synthase activity was observed in two eukaryotic species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens; however, inositol 1-phosphate was not incorporated. In Eukarya, the only pathway converts free inositol and CDP-DAG directly into PI. Phylogenic analysis of PIP synthase, AIP synthase, and PI synthase revealed that they are closely related enzymes.",2.297,1006

The initiation of Dll expression in clusters of cells in mid-lateral regions of the Drosophila embryo represents the earliest genetic marker of limbs. Dll genes are involved in the development of the peripheral nervous system and sensitive organs, and they also function as master regulators of black pigmentation in some insect lineages.

22561693,New insight into the evolution of aquaporins from flowering plants and vertebrates: orthologous identification and functional transfer is possible.,[],Gene,2012,"Aquaporins (AQPs) represent a family of channel proteins that transport water and/or small solutes across cell membranes in the three domains of life. In all previous phylogenetic analysis of aquaporin, trees constructed using proteins with very low amino acid identity (<15%) were incongruent with rRNA data. In this work, restricting the evolutionary study of aquaporins to proteins with high amino acid identity (>25%), we showed congruence between AQPs and organismal trees. On the basis of this analysis, we defined 19 orthologous gene clusters in flowering plant species (3 PIP-like, 7 TIP-like, 6 NIP-like and 3 SIP-like). We described specific conserved motifs for each subfamily and each cluster, which were used to develop a method for automatic classification. Analysis of amino acid identity between orthologous monocotyledon and dicotyledon AQPs from each cluster, suggested that PIPs are under high evolutionary constraint. The phylogenetic analysis allowed us the assignment of orthologous aquaporins for very distant animal lineages (tetrapods-fishes). We also demonstrated that the location of all vertebrate AQPs in the ortholog clusters could be predicted by comparing their amino acid identity with human AQPs. We defined four AQP subfamilies in animals: AQP1-like, AQP8-like, AQP3-like and AQP11-like. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the four animal AQPs subfamilies are related with PIP-like, TIP-like, NIP-like and SIP-like subfamilies, respectively. Thus, this analysis would allow the prediction of individual AQPs function on the basis of orthologous genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens.",2.138,1289

The genetic features concerning the codon usage of dengue virus (DENV) were analyzed by the relative synonymous codon usage, the effective number of codons and the codon adaptation index. The evolutionary distance between DENV and the natural hosts (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti) was estimated by a novel formula. Finally, the synonymous codon usage preference for the translation initiation region of this virus was also analyzed. The result indicates that the general trend of the 59 synonymous codon usage of the four genotypes of DENV are similar to each other, and this pattern has no link with the geographic distribution of the virus. The effect of codon usage pattern of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti on the formation of codon usage of DENV is stronger than that of the two primates. Turning to the codon usage preference of the translation initiation region of this virus, some codons pairing to low tRNA copy numbers in the two primates have a stronger tendency to exist in the translation initiation region than those in the open reading frame of DENV. Although DENV, like other RNA viruses, has a high mutation to adapt its hosts, the regulatory features about the synonymous codon usage have been 'branded' on the translation initiation region of this virus in order to hijack the translational mechanisms of the hosts.",3.234,1180

In this study, the authors examined the role of stimulus meaning in the analogical reasoning abilities of three different primate species. Humans (Homo sapiens), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) completed the same relational matching-to-sample (RMTS) tasks with both meaningful and nonmeaningful stimuli. This discrimination of relations-between-relations serves as the basis for analogical reasoning. Meaningfulness facilitated the acquisition of analogical matching for human participants, whereas individual differences among the chimpanzees suggest that meaning can either enable or hinder their ability to complete analogies.

Similar to FR10, the DRP10 protein was found to also contain a highly conserved N-terminal cleavable signal peptide. Furthermore, DRP10 was found to have high structural homology to the available crystal structures of type A and E apolipoproteins in Homo sapiens, and a type IV LS-12 anti-freeze protein in the longhorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosis. In response to dehydration, the transcript expression of drp10 was found to increase 1.52 +/- 0.16-fold and 1.97 +/- 0.11-fold in response to medium (15%) and high (30%) dehydration stresses in the liver tissue of X. laevis, respectively, while drp10 expression increased 2.12 +/- 0.12-fold and 1.46 +/- 0.16-fold in kidney tissue.

With the ability of the mass spectrometers to identify increasing numbers of proteins the identification of undesirable peptides (those not from the protein sample) has also increased. Most undesirable contaminants originate in the laboratory and come from either the user (e.g. keratin from hair and skin), or from reagents (e.g. trypsin), that are required to prepare samples for analysis. We found that a significant amount of MS instrument time was spent sequencing peptides from abundant contaminant proteins. While completely eliminating non-specific protein contamination is not feasible, it is possible to reduce the sequencing of these contaminants. For example, exclusion lists can provide a list of masses that can be used to instruct the mass spectrometer to 'ignore' the undesired contaminant peptides in the list. We empirically generated be-spoke exclusion lists for several model organisms (Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis), utilising information from over 500 mass spectrometry runs and cumulative analysis of these data. Here we show that by employing these empirically generated lists, it was possible to reduce the time spent analysing contaminating peptides in a given sample thereby facilitating more efficient data acquisition and analysis.

Archaeologically, it belongs to a wider Isthmo-Colombian Area. Today, seven indigenous ethnic groups account for 12.3% of Panama's population. Five speak Chibchan languages and are characterized by low genetic diversity and a high level of differentiation. In addition, no evidence of differential structuring between maternally and paternally inherited genes has been reported in isthmian Chibchan cultural groups. Recent data have shown that 83% of the Panamanian general population harbour mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of Native American ancestry. Considering differential male/female mortality at European contact and multiple degrees of geographical and genetic isolation over the subsequent five centuries, the Y-chromosome Native American component is expected to vary across different geographic regions and communities in Panama. To address this issue, we investigated Y-chromosome variation in 408 modern males from the nine provinces of Panama and one indigenous territory (the comarca of Kuna Yala). In contrast to mtDNA data, the Y-chromosome Native American component (haplogroup Q) exceeds 50% only in three populations facing the Caribbean Sea: the comarca of Kuna Yala and Bocas del Toro province where Chibchan languages are spoken by the majority, and the province of Colon where many Kuna and people of mixed indigenous-African-and-European descent live. Elsewhere the Old World component is dominant and mostly represented by western Eurasian haplogroups, which signal the strong male genetic impact of invaders. Sub-Saharan African input accounts for 5.9% of male haplotypes. This reflects the consequences of the colonial Atlantic slave trade and more recent influxes of West Indians of African heritage. Overall, our findings reveal a local evolution of the male Native American ancestral gene pool, and a strong but geographically differentiated unidirectional sex bias in the formation of local modern Panamanian populations.",3.234,848

Functional explanations may be appropriate for certain aspects of glenoid fossa morphology; however, other factors--e.g., allometry, evolutionary development--must be addressed before functional morphology is considered.

Permutation analysis revealed that side, sex, and lifestyle did not correlate with shape. Of the features we found to differ between groups, anterior glenoid rim morphology and fossa curvature did not correlate with the aforementioned shape variables; thus, a functional explanation is appropriate for these components of glenoid fossa shape. Shared morphology among recent humans and chimpanzees (to the exclusion of Neandertals and orangutans) suggests independent forces contributing to these morphological configurations. Potential explanations include adaptations to habitual behavior and locomotor adaptations in the scapulae of recent humans and chimpanzees; these explanations are supported by clinical and experimental literature. The absence of these morphological features in Neandertals may support the lack of these selective forces on their scapular glenoid fossa morphology.",1.542,810

Preliminary studies showed that it not only suppressed tumor growth but also closely related to tumor metastasis, however, its molecular mechanisms is still unclear. There have been reported that protein encoded by LASS2/TMSG-1 could directly interact with the C subunit of Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which suggested that LASS2/TMSG1 might inhibit the invasion and metastasis through regulating the function of V-ATPase. Thus, in this study, we explored the effect of small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting LASS2/TMSG1 on the invasion of human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3M-2B4 and its molecular mechanisms associated with the V-ATPase. Real-time fluorogentic quantitative PCR (RFQ-PCR) and Western blot revealed dramatic reduction of 84.5% and 60% in the levels of LASS2/TMSG1 mRNA and protein after transfection of siRNA in PC-3M-2B4 cells. The V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration were significantly increased in 2B4 cells transfected with the LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA compared with the controls. The activity of secreted MMP-2 was up-regulated in LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA treated cells compared with the controls; and the capacity for migration and invasion in LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA treated cells was significantly higher than the controls.

The transcriptional regulation of miR-17-92 cluster has been extensively studied in mammals, but not in birds. To date, avian miR-17-92 cluster genomic structure has not been fully determined. The promoter location and sequence of miR-17-92 cluster have not been determined, due to the existence of a genomic gap sequence upstream of miR-17-92 cluster in all the birds whose genomes have been sequenced. In this study, genome walking was used to close the genomic gap upstream of chicken miR-17-92 cluster. In addition, bioinformatics analysis, reporter gene assay and truncation mutagenesis were used to investigate functional role of the genomic gap sequence. Genome walking analysis showed that the gap region was 1704 bp long, and its GC content was 80.11%. Bioinformatics analysis showed that in the gap region, there was a 200 bp conserved sequence among the tested 10 species (Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, Sus scrofa, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Possum, Danio rerio, Rana nigromaculata), which is core promoter region of mammalian miR-17-92 host gene (MIR17HG).

The full-length sequence was 2,339 bp that contained a 216 bp 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), a 194 bp 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and a 1,929 bp open reading frame that encoded a special protein of 643 amino acids (aa). The calculated molecular weight of the putative ec-KIFC1 was 71 kDa and its estimated isoelectric point was 9.47. The putative ec-KIFC1 protein owns a tail domain from 1 to 116 aa, a stalk domain from 117 to 291 aa and a conserved carboxyl motor domain from 292 to 642 aa.

Tissue expression analysis showed the presence of ovary, heart, liver, intestine, oviduct, testis and muscle. The phylogenetic tree revealed that ec-KIFC1 was more closely related to vertebrate KIFC1 than to invertebrate KIFC1. In situ hybridization showed that the ec-KIFC1 mRNA was localized in the periphery of the nuclear membrane and the center of the nucleus in early spermatids. In mid spermatids, the ec-KIFC1 had abundant expression in the center of nucleus, and was expressed in the tail and the anterior part of spermatids. In the late spermatid, the nucleus gradually became elongated, and the ec-KIFC1 mRNA signal was still centralized in the nucleus. In mature spermatids, the signal of the ec-KIFC1 gradually became weak, and was mainly located at the tail of spermatids. Therefore, the ec-KIFC1 probably plays a critical role in the spermatogenesis of E. chinensis.",2.024,1139

Cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogene. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity has been known as a potential strategy for cancer therapy. SAHA is an HDAC inhibitor that has been used in cancer therapy but still has side effects. SAHA modification proposed to minimize side effects. Triazole attachment on the chain of SAHA has been known to enhance the inhibition ability of SAHA and less toxic. In this study, it will be carried out with molecular dynamic simulations of SAHA modifications consisting ligand 1a, 2a and, 2c to interact with six HDAC in hydrated conditions. To all six HDAC Class II, performed docking with SAHA and a modified inhibitor. The docking results were then carried out molecular dynamics simulations to determine the inhibitor affinities in hydrated conditions. The molecular dynamic simulations results show better affinities of ligand 2c with HDAC 4, 6, and 7 than SAHA itself, and good affinity was also shown by ligand 2a and 1c on HDAC 5 and 9. The results of this study can be a reference to obtain better inhibitors.",4.981,103

The minimal, core enzyme found in Aquifex aeolicus is made of a catalytic domain, which catalyzes the aminoacylation reaction, and an anticodon-binding domain, which promotes tRNA-protein association. In eukaryotes, additional domains are appended in cis or in trans to the core enzyme and increase the stability of the tRNA-protein complexes. Eventually, as observed for MetRS from Homo sapiens, the C-terminal appended domain causes a slow release of aminoacyl-tRNA and establishes a limiting step in the global aminoacylation reaction. Here, we report that MetRS from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays a new type of structural organization. Its very C-terminal appended domain is related to the oligonucleotide binding-fold-based tRNA-binding domain (tRBD) recovered at the C-terminus of MetRS from plant, but, in the nematode enzyme, this domain is separated from the core enzyme by an insertion domain. Gel retardation and tRNA aminoacylation experiments show that MetRS from nematode is functionally related to human MetRS despite the fact that their appended tRBDs have distinct structural folds, and are not orthologs. Thus, functional convergence of human and nematode MetRS is the result of parallel and convergent evolution that might have been triggered by the selective pressure to invent processivity of tRNA handling in translation in higher eukaryotes.",0,1647

All the 16 codons that contain uracil (or thymine in gene) as the second nucleotide code for the five large hydrophobic residues (LHRs), namely phenylalanine,v isoleucine, leucine, methionine and valine. Thymine content (i.e. the fraction of XTX codons, where X = A, C, G, or T) in PINK1 mRNA sequences and its relationship with protein stability and function are the focus of this work. This analysis will shed light on PINK1's stability, thus a clue can be provided to understand the mitochondrial dysfunction and the failure of oxidative stress control frequently observed in Parkinson's disease. We obtained the complete PINK1 mRNA sequences of 8 different species. The distributions of XTX codons in different frames are calculated. We observed that the thymine content reached the highest level in the coding frame 1 of the PINK1 mRNA sequence of Bos Taurus (Bt), that is peaked at 27%. Coding frame 1 containing low thymine leads to the reduction in LHRs in the corresponding proteins. Therefore, we conjecture that proteins from the other organisms, including Homo sapiens, lost some of their hydrophobicity and became susceptible to dysfunction. Genes such as PINK1 have reduced thymine in the evolutionary process thereby making their protein products potentially being susceptible to instability and causing disease. Adding more hydrophobic residues (thymine) at appropriate places might help conserve important biological functions.",4.981,1832

After its initial publication, the fossil specimen remained largely unknown outside of the Serbian academe and no detailed comparative study has ever been carried out. Since the whereabouts of the fossil itself are currently unknown, and given its potential significance for the Pleistocene human evolution, we re-examine the data published by Zivanovic (1966, 1975). Using the original measurements, mostly taken on the frontal bone, and a wide comparative sample of 68 fossil specimens, the fossil was compared and analyzed by statistical multivariate methods. We also conducted a visual examination of the morphology based on the available photographic material. Our analysis reveals phenetic similarity with Middle Pleistocene archaic Homo from Africa and anatomically modern Homo sapiens. However, the absence of primitive cranial traits in Backi Petrovac indicates a clear modern Homo sapiens designation. Although lost at the moment, there is a chance for the re-discovery of the fossil in the years to come. This would give us an opportunity to acquire absolute dates and to study the specimen in a more detailed manner.",0,207

Some analyses have observed that in at least a few anatomical regions modern humans today appear to have relatively low trabecular density, but little is known about how that density varies throughout the human skeleton and across species or how and when the present trabecular patterns emerged over the course of human evolution. Here, we test the hypotheses that (i) recent modern humans have low trabecular density throughout the upper and lower limbs compared with other primate taxa and (ii) the reduction in trabecular density first occurred in early Homo erectus, consistent with the shift toward a modern human locomotor anatomy, or more recently in concert with diaphyseal gracilization in Holocene humans. We used peripheral quantitative CT and microtomography to measure trabecular bone of limb epiphyses (long bone articular ends) in modern humans and chimpanzees and in fossil hominins attributed to Australopithecus africanus, Paranthropus robustus/early Homo from Swartkrans, Homo neanderthalensis, and early Homo sapiens. Results show that only recent modern humans have low trabecular density throughout the limb joints. Extinct hominins, including pre-Holocene Homo sapiens, retain the high levels seen in nonhuman primates. Thus, the low trabecular density of the recent modern human skeleton evolved late in our evolutionary history, potentially resulting from increased sedentism and reliance on technological and cultural innovations.",9.674,176
22099634,Detecting breakdown points in metabolic networks.,"['Tagore S', 'De RK']",Computational biology and chemistry,2011,"BACKGROUND: A complex network of biochemical reactions present in an organism generates various biological moieties necessary for its survival. It is seen that biological systems are robust to genetic and environmental changes at all levels of organization. Functions of various organisms are sustained against mutational changes by using alternative pathways. It is also seen that if any one of the paths for production of the same metabolite is hampered, an alternate path tries to overcome this defect and helps in combating the damage. METHODOLOGY: Certain physical, chemical or genetic change in any of the precursor substrate of a biochemical reaction may damage the production of the ultimate product. We employ a quantitative approach for simulating this phenomena of causing a physical change in the biochemical reactions by performing external perturbations to 12 metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisae as well as 14 metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in Homo sapiens. Here, we investigate the relationship between structure and degree of compatibility of metabolites against external perturbations, i.e., robustness. Robustness can also be further used to identify the extent to which a metabolic pathway can resist a mutation event. Biological networks with a certain connectivity distribution may be very resilient to a particular attack but not to another. The goal of this work is to determine the exact boundary of network breakdown due to both random and targeted attack, thereby analyzing its robustness. We also find that compared to various non-standard models, metabolic networks are exceptionally robust. Here, we report the use of a 'Resilience-based' score for enumerating the concept of 'network-breakdown'. We also use this approach for analyzing metabolite essentiality providing insight into cellular robustness that can be further used for future drug development. RESULTS: We have investigated the behavior of metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in S. cerevisae and H. sapiens against random and targeted attack. Both random as well as targeted resilience were calculated by formulating a measure, that we termed as 'Resilience score'. Datasets of metabolites were collected for 12 metabolic pathways belonging to carbohydrate metabolism in S. cerevisae and 14 metabolic pathways belonging to carbohydrate metabolism in H. sapiens from Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes (KEGG).",1.117,1222

This study examines the distribution of mineral density in the third metacarpal heads in three hominoid species that differ in their habitual joint postures and loading histories. We test the hypothesis that micro-architectural properties relating to bone mineral density reflect habitual joint use. The third metacarpal heads of Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, and Homo sapiens were sectioned in a sagittal plane and imaged using backscattered electron microscopy (BSE-SEM). For each individual, 72 areas of subarticular cortical (subchondral) and trabecular bone were sampled from within 12 consecutive regions of the BSE-SEM images. In each area, gray levels (representing relative mineralization density) were quantified. Results show that chimpanzee, orangutan, and human metacarpal III heads have different gray level distributions. Weighted mean gray levels (WMGLs) in the chimpanzee showed a distinct pattern in which the 'knuckle-walking' regions (dorsal) and 'climbing' regions (palmar) are less mineralized, interpreted to reflect elevated remodeling rates, than the distal regions. Pongo pygmaeus exhibited the lowest WMGLs in the distal region, suggesting elevated remodeling rates in this region, which is loaded during hook grip hand postures associated with suspension and climbing. Differences among regions within metacarpal heads of the chimpanzee and orangutan specimens are significant (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001). In humans, whose hands are used for manipulation as opposed to locomotion, mineralization density is much more uniform throughout the metacarpal head. WMGLs were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in subchondral compared to trabecular regions in all samples except humans. This micro-architectural approach offers a means of investigating joint loading patterns in primates and shows significant differences in metacarpal joint biomechanics among great apes and humans.",3.733,159

The vocal correlates of a large larynx and an elongated vocal tract, a low fundamental frequency and low vocal tract resonance frequencies, deter rival males and attract receptive females. The males of the polygynous goitred gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa, provide another, independently evolved, example of an enlarged and low-resting larynx of high mobility. Relevant aspects of the rutting behaviour of territorial wild male goitred gazelles are described. Video and audio recordings served to study the acoustic effects of the enlarged larynx and vocal tract elongation on male rutting calls. Three call types were discriminated: roars, growls and grunts. In addition, the adult male vocal anatomy during the emission of rutting calls is described and functionally discussed using a 2D-model of larynx retraction.

To explore its functions during spermiogenesis of Octopus tankahkeei (O. tankahkeei), we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA of this mammalian PHB homologue (termed ot-PHB) from the testes of O. tankahkeei. The 1165 bp ot-phb cDNA contains a 100 bp 5' UTR, a 882 bp open reading frame and a 183 bp 3' UTR. The putative ot-PHB protein owns a transmembrane domain from 6 to 31 amino acid (aa) and a putative PHB domain from 26 to 178 aa. Protein alignment demonstrated that ot-PHB had 73.3, 73.6, 74.0, 75.1, and 45.4% identity with its homologues in Homo sapiens, Mus muculus, Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis and Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. Tissue distribution profile analysis revealed its presence in all the tissues examined. In situ hybridization in spermiogenic cells demonstrated that ot-phb was expressed moderately at the beginning of the spermiogenesis. The abundance of transcripts increased in intermediate spermatids and in drastically remodeling final spermatids. In mature spermatozoa, the residuary transcripts concentrated around the chondriosomal mantle where mitochondria assemble around. In summary, the expression of ot-phb during spermiogenesis implicates a potential function of this protein during mitochondrial ubiquitination. It is the first time to implicate the role of prohibitin in cephalopod spermiogenesis.",2.024,1374

 States of America",2010,"Metabolic labeling of glycans with synthetic sugar analogs has emerged as an attractive means for introducing nonnatural chemical functionality into glycoproteins. However, the complexities of glycan biosynthesis prevent the installation of nonnatural moieties at defined, predictable locations within glycoproteins at high levels of incorporation. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved N-acetyglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues within chitobiose cores of N-glycans in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be specifically targeted for metabolic replacement by unnatural sugars. We introduced an exogenous GlcNAc salvage pathway into yeast, allowing cells to metabolize GlcNAc provided as a supplement to the culture medium. We then rendered the yeast auxotrophic for production of the donor nucleotide-sugar uridine-diphosphate-GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNAc) by deletion of the essential gene GNA1. We demonstrate that gna1Delta strains require a GlcNAc supplement and that expression plasmids containing both exogenous components of the salvage pathway, GlcNAc transporter NGT1 from Candida albicans and GlcNAc kinase NAGK from Homo sapiens, are required for rescue in this context. Further, we show that cells successfully incorporate synthetic GlcNAc analogs N-azidoacetyglucosamine (GlcNAz) and N-(4-pentynoyl)-glucosamine (GlcNAl) into cell-surface glycans and secreted glycoproteins. To verify incorporation of the nonnatural sugars at N-glycan core positions, endoglycosidase H (endoH)-digested peptides from a purified secretory glycoprotein, Ygp1, were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Multiple Ygp1 N-glycosylation sites bearing GlcNAc, isotopically labeled GlcNAc, or GlcNAz were identified; these modifications were dependent on the supplement added to the culture medium. This system enables the production of glycoproteins that are functionalized for specific chemical modifications at their glycosylation sites.",9.674,1865

Associated with significant fossil hominin remains are two stone tool industries, the Aterian and Mousterian, which have been differentiated, respectively, primarily on the basis of the presence and absence of tanged, or stemmed, stone tools. Largely because of historical reasons, these two industries have been attributed to the western Eurasian Middle Paleolithic rather than the African Middle Stone Age. In this paper, drawing on our recent excavation of Contrebandiers Cave and other published data, we show that, aside from the presence or absence of tanged pieces, there are no other distinctions between these two industries in terms of either lithic attributes or chronology. Together, these results demonstrate that these two 'industries' are instead variants of the same entity. Moreover, several additional characteristics of these assemblages, such as distinctive stone implements and the manufacture and use of bone tools and possible shell ornaments, suggest a closer affinity to other Late Pleistocene African Middle Stone Age industries rather than to the Middle Paleolithic of western Eurasia.",3.733,1221

In contrast to the life of early H. sapiens, modern lifestyles are predominantly sedentary. As a result, intake of excessive amounts of carbohydrates due to the easy and continuous accessibility to modern high-energy food and drinks has not only become unnecessary but also led to metabolic diseases in the face of physical inactivity. A resulting metabolic disease is type 2 diabetes, a complex endocrine disorder characterized by abnormally high concentrations of circulating glucose. This disease now affects millions of people worldwide. Exercise has beneficial effects to help control impaired glucose homeostasis with metabolic disease, and is a well-established tool to prevent and combat type 2 diabetes. This chapter focuses on the effects of exercise on carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle and systemic glucose homeostasis. We will also focus on the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of exercise to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. It is now well established that there are different proximal signaling pathways that mediate the effects of exercise and insulin on glucose uptake, and these distinct mechanisms are consistent with the ability of exercise to increase glucose uptake in the face of insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes. Ongoing research in this area is aimed at defining the precise mechanism by which exercise increases glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity and the types of exercise necessary for these important health benefits.",3.488,787

23959672,Transcriptional and functional regulation of the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1.,['Spanier B'],The Journal of physiology,2014,"Dietary proteins are cleaved within the intestinal lumen to oligopeptides which are further processed to small peptides (di- and tripeptides) and free amino acids. Although the transport of amino acids is mediated by several specific amino acid transporters, the proton-coupled uptake of the more than 8000 different di- and tripeptides is performed by the high-capacity/low-affinity peptide transporter isoform PEPT1 (SLC15A1). Its wide substrate tolerance also allows the transport of a repertoire of structurally closely related compounds and drugs, which explains their high oral bioavailability and brings PEPT1 into focus for medical and pharmaceutical approaches. Although the first evidence for the interplay of nutrient supply and PEPT1 expression and function was described over 20 years ago, many aspects of the molecular processes controlling its transcription and translation and modifying its transporter properties are still awaiting discovery. The present review summarizes the recent knowledge on the factors modulating PEPT1 expression and function in Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, with focus on dietary ingredients, transcription factors and functional modulators, such as the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3 and selected scaffold proteins.",0,980

Section D, Structural biology",2016,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and is a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis and glyconeogenesis and, more generally, of the control of energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Vertebrates, and notably Homo sapiens, express two FBPase isoforms. The liver isozyme is expressed mainly in gluconeogenic organs, where it functions as a regulator of glucose synthesis. The muscle isoform is expressed in all cells, and recent studies have demonstrated that its role goes far beyond the enzymatic function, as it can interact with various nuclear and mitochondrial proteins. Even in its enzymatic function, the muscle enzyme is different from the liver isoform, as it is 100-fold more susceptible to allosteric inhibition by AMP and this effect can be abrogated by complex formation with aldolase. All FBPases are homotetramers composed of two intimate dimers: the upper dimer and the lower dimer. They oscillate between two conformational states: the inactive T form when in complex with AMP, and the active R form. Parenthetically, it is noted that bacterial FBPases behave somewhat differently, and in the absence of allosteric activators exist in a tetramer-dimer equilibrium even at relatively high concentrations. [Hines et al. (2007), J. Biol. Chem. 282, 11696-11704]. The T-to-R transition is correlated with the conformation of the key loop L2, which in the T form becomes `disengaged' and unable to participate in the catalytic mechanism. The T states of both isoforms are very similar, with a small twist of the upper dimer relative to the lower dimer. It is shown that at variance with the well studied R form of the liver enzyme, which is flat, the R form of the muscle enzyme is diametrically different, with a perpendicular orientation of the upper and lower dimers. The crystal structure of the muscle-isozyme R form shows that in this arrangement of the tetramer completely new protein surfaces are exposed that are most likely targets for the interactions with various cellular and enzymatic partners. The cruciform R structure is stabilized by a novel `leucine lock', which prevents the key residue, Asp187, from locking loop L2 in the disengaged conformation. In addition, the crystal structures of muscle FBPase in the T conformation with and without AMP strongly suggest that the T-to-R transition is a discrete jump rather than a shift of an equilibrium smooth transition through multiple intermediate states. Finally, using snapshots from three crystal structures of human muscle FBPase, it is conclusively demonstrated that the AMP-binding event is correlated with a beta-->alpha transition at the N-terminus of the protein and with the formation of a new helical structure.",2.184,682

Robertsonian translocations and a few inversions differentiated the karyotypes of the examined species. Painting of P. auritus karyotype with human probes revealed 3 previously undetected cryptic segments homologous to human chromosomes (Homo sapiens, HSA) 8, 15, and 19, respectively. As a consequence, the existence of 2 HSA 4 + 8 syntenies in the P. auritus karyotype has been proven.

Participants who had to acquire spatial information about a hidden goal from the experimental contingencies alone showed patterns of search most like nutcrackers in the companion study (B. M.

Surprisingly, postexperimental questionnaires revealed that most participants used an alternative strategy of vector integration rather than cognitive mapping during search for the hidden goal.

As light-regulated actuators, photoreceptors underpin optogenetics, which denotes the noninvasive, reversible, and spatiotemporally precise perturbation by light of living cells and organisms. Of particular versatility, naturally occurring photoactivated adenylate cyclases promote the synthesis of the second messenger cAMP under blue light. Here, we have engineered a light-activated phosphodiesterase (LAPD) with complementary light sensitivity and catalytic activity by recombining the photosensor module of Deinococcus radiodurans bacterial phytochrome with the effector module of Homo sapiens phosphodiesterase 2A. Upon red-light absorption, LAPD up-regulates hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP by up to sixfold, whereas far-red light can be used to down-regulate activity. LAPD also mediates light-activated cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis in eukaryotic cell cultures and in zebrafish embryos; crucially, the biliverdin chromophore of LAPD is available endogenously and does not need to be provided exogenously. LAPD thus establishes a new optogenetic modality that permits light control over diverse cAMP/cGMP-mediated physiological processes. Because red light penetrates tissue more deeply than light of shorter wavelengths, LAPD appears particularly attractive for studies in living organisms.",9.674,942

These findings lend support to the view that DUF1220 domain dosage is a key factor in the determination of primate (and human) brain size. Here we analyze 41 animal genomes and present the most complete account to date of the evolutionary history and genome organization of DUF1220 domains and the gene family that encodes them (NBPF). Included among the novel features identified by this analysis is a DUF1220 domain precursor in nonmammalian vertebrates, a unique predicted promoter common to all mammalian NBPF genes, six distinct clades into which DUF1220 sequences can be subdivided, and a previously unknown member of the NBPF gene family (NBPF25). Most importantly, we show that the exceptional HLS increase in DUF1220 copy number (from 102 in our last common ancestor with chimp to 272 in human; an average HLS increase of ~28 copies every million years since the Homo/Pan split) was driven by intragenic domain hyperamplification. This increase primarily involved a 4.7 kb, tandemly repeated three DUF1220 domain unit we have named the HLS DUF1220 triplet, a motif that is a likely candidate to underlie key properties unique to the Homo sapiens brain. Interestingly, all copies of the HLS DUF1220 triplet lie within a human-specific pericentric inversion that also includes the 1q12 C-band, a polymorphic heterochromatin expansion that is unique to the human genome. Both cytogenetic features likely played key roles in the rapid HLS DUF1220 triplet hyperamplification, which is among the most striking genomic changes specific to the human lineage.",0,1177

In a first experiment, the MTS performance of both capuchin monkeys and humans benefitted from stimulus redundancy. Moreover, a local advantage in capuchins was observed with visual patterns that required grouping at both global and local level. In a second experiment we eliminated the requirement to group at the local level. This was done to determine if the effects of redundancy would have been evident in condition more similar to those used in previous studies of global-local processing in a comparative context. The benefits of stimulus redundancy emerged again in both species but were confined to local processing in monkeys and to global processing in humans. A local advantage was observed in both species. In a third experiment, the reduction of the size of the stimuli and the increase of the quantity of the local elements produced a shift to global dominance in humans but the local dominance in monkeys was preserved. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to other similarities and differences in higher visual functions in humans and monkeys.",3.028,145

In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference among the first three groups. These results suggest that these three groups may have formed single evolving lineage while H. sapiens represents a separate evolutionary development. The purpose of the current research was to discern if the mandible reflected a similar pattern as the cranial vault data. This study used lateral jpeg images of the mandible. Five fossil samples were used: A. robustus (n=7), H. erectus (n=12), H. heidelbergensis (n=4), H. neanderthalensis (n=22) and H. sapiens (n=61). Each mandible image was pre-processed with Photoshop Elements. Each image was then submitted to a specially written routine that digitized the 84 points along the mandible boundary. Each mandible was fitted with elliptical Fourier functions (EFFs). Procrustes superimposition was imposed to insure minimum shape differences. The mandible results largely mirrored the earlier cranial vault study with one exception. Statistically significant results were obtained for the mandible between the H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis samples in contrast to the earlier cranial vault data. F-tests disclosed that the statistical significance was limited to the anterior symphysis of the mandible. This mosaic pattern may be explained by the reduction in prognathism with the concomitant if rudimentary development of the chin as seen in H. neanderthalensis compared to H. erectus.",0,651

Although baboons initially encoded both features of the first category, they ultimately retained only the distinctive features of each category. Empirical data from the two species were analyzed with the 1996 ADIT connectionist model of Kruschke.

Comparison is required at both population and species level. Several methodological issues (e.g., ecological validity) are crucial, as are major confounding variables (e.g., bimanuality). The behavioral manual laterality of chimpanzees is well-studied in a variety of contexts. Especially important is tool use, which seems to enhance extent of lateralization, but this varies both within and across populations.

To understand the evolutionary mechanisms acting on HLA-G, we evaluated the presence or absence of the AluyHG element, associating this variable site with others observed at HLA-G coding, 3'-UTR, or both regions in four distinct populations (Brazilian, French, Congolese, and Senegalese). The results were compared with the 1000Genomes Consortium data. The worldwide AluyHG frequencies showed an increment, starting lower in Africa and increasing following distance and time of human dispersion out of Africa. The same haplotype pattern was observed in all populations, indicating that most of the HLA-G haplotypes already detected were originated earlier in Africa, before Homo sapiens dispersion. The AluyHG insertion was associated with the G*01:01:01:01/UTR-1 haplotype, with rare recombinants. Despite its high frequency in worldwide populations, the G*01:01:01:01/UTR-1 haplotype should be very recent.

We recently used RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to show, in individual nuclei, that marsupial X inactivation (in the absence of XIST) occurs on a gene-by-gene basis, and that escape from inactivation is stochastic and independent of gene location. In the absence of similar data from fibroblast cell lines of eutherian representatives, a meaningful comparison is lacking. We therefore used RNA-FISH to examine XCI in fibroblast cell lines obtained from three distantly related eutherian model species: African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana), mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo sapiens). We show that, unlike the orthologous marsupial X, inactivation of the X conserved region (XCR) in eutherians generally is complete. Two-colour RNA-FISH on female human, mouse and elephant interphase nuclei showed that XCR loci have monoallelic expression in almost all nuclei. However, we found that many loci located in the evolutionarily distinct recently added region (XAR) displayed reproducible locus-specific frequencies of nuclei with either one or two active X alleles. We propose that marsupial XCI retains features of an ancient incomplete silencing mechanism that was augmented by the evolution of the XIST gene that progressively stabilized the eutherian XCR.

The following results were obtained: (1) pentamers from HCV polyprotein have a widespread and high level of similarity to a large number of human proteins (19,605 human proteins, that is 57.6% of the human proteome); (2) remarkable similarity between the two proteomes persists even using longer peptide motifs as probes for identity scanning; (3) only a limited number of HCV pentameric fragments have no similarity to the human host, so representing molecular sequence signatures of the virus. We conclude that the widespread sharing of numerous perfect exact matches between HCV and human proteomes might explain HCV persistence in humans.",2.618,462
19999243,Medicine in the 21st century: towards a Darwinian medical epistemology.,['Roman-Franco AA'],Puerto Rico health sciences journal,2009,In this review we reflect upon the new science of Darwinian medicine. It is a tenet of modern biology that evolutionary theory as proposed by Charles Darwin and further refined via the new synthesis is the common thread that ties all of biological inquiry into a coherent whole. This review aims at making clear how evolution by natural selection is relevant to medicine. A set of pertinent examples linking Homo sapiens sapiens' present disease conditions to its evolution during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs are discussed. The review concludes with observations as to the epistemological value of evolutionary theory as a heuristic tool for articulating a medical paradigm in accord with modern biology.,0.672,1845

To proceed we applied the most intensive modern methods of 3D geometric morphometrics to dental form, specifically the shapes of the upper second molars (M(2)s) in a sample combining 13 Australopithecus, 11 Paranthropus, and 23 Homo. We analyzed outer and inner crown surfaces, as well as crown and cervical outlines both separately and together, using a total of 16 landmarks, 51 curve semilandmarks, and 48 pseudolandmarks over the four structures. Outer and inner enamel surfaces are highly correlated in this dataset, while crown outline is the least informative of the four structures. Homo was easily distinguished from both Australopithecus and Paranthropus by these methods, likewise Homo sapiens from Homo neanderthalensis. There were, however, no stable classes within the Australopithecus sample or between Australopithecus and Paranthropus. Instead, there was a gradient along which Australopithecus prometheus and Australopithecus africanus lie toward the extremes, with Paranthropus overlapping both. If there are indeed different species at this site, then either their M(2) morphologies are uninformative or else the present sample is too small to make an accurate assessment. Our findings suggest that the variability of the Australopithecus specimens will be difficult to interpret authoritatively, independent of the method used.",3.733,406

To identify these proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system and screened a HeLa cDNA library. Six positive colonies were isolated from 1.5x10(6) transformants. The cDNA sequence of each positive colony was determined. Two novel cDNA fragments (p53BP1 and p53BP2) were cloned. These two cDNA fragments code for the same protein composed of 158 amino acids, which shows high similarity to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC9) of H. sapiens as well as to E2s from other organisms, such as UBC (76 %) of C. elegans, HUS5(66 %) of S. pombe, UBC(66 %) of A. thaliana and UBC9(56 %) of S. cerevisiae. A cDNA fragment from p53BP1 was used to probe a Northern blot containing poly(A)(+) RNA from various human tissues and various cell lines.

According to WHO prediction, COPD is to become the third leading cause of death by 2030. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms leading to chronic infections are poorly understood and the difficulty in culturing C pneumoniae in experimental conditions and lack of entirely satisfactory serological methods for diagnosis is also a hurdle for drug discovery and development. We have performed an insilico synteny based comparative genomics analysis of C pneumoniae and other eight Chlamydial organisms to know the potential of C pneumoniae which cause COPD but other Chlamydial organisms lack in potential to cause COPD though some are involved in human pathogenesis. We have identified total 354 protein sequences as non-orthologous to other Chlamydial organisms, except hypothetical proteins 70 were found functional out of which 60 are non homologous to Homo sapiens proteome and among them 18 protein sequences are found to be essential for survival of the C pneumoniae based on BLASTP search against DEG database of essential genes. CELLO analysis results showed that about 80% proteins are found to be cytoplasmic, Among which 5 were found as bacterial exotoxins and 2 as bacterial endotoxins, remaining 11 proteins were found to be involved in DNA binding, RNA binding, catalytic activity, ATP binding, oxidoreductase activity, hydrolase activity and proteolysis activity.

The stone tool assemblages are identified as a Middle Palaeolithic industry that includes Levallois manufacturing methods and the production of tools on flakes. Hominin occupations correspond with humid periods, particularly Marine Isotope Stages 7 and 5 of the Late Pleistocene. The Middle Palaeolithic occupations were situated along the Jubbah palaeolake-shores, in a grassland setting with some trees. Populations procured different raw materials across the lake region to manufacture stone tools, using the implements to process plants and animals. To reach the Jubbah palaeolake, Middle Palaeolithic populations travelled into the ameliorated Nefud Desert interior, possibly gaining access from multiple directions, either using routes from the north and west (the Levant and the Sinai), the north (the Mesopotamian plains and the Euphrates basin), or the east (the Persian Gulf). The Jubbah stone tool assemblages have their own suite of technological characters, but have types reminiscent of both African Middle Stone Age and Levantine Middle Palaeolithic industries.

Similarity in overall shape does not necessarily demonstrate that the Kebara 2 hyoid was used in the same way as that of Homo sapiens. The mechanical performance of whole bones is partly controlled by internal trabecular geometries, regulated by bone-remodelling in response to the forces applied. Here we show that the Neanderthal and modern human hyoids also present very similar internal architectures and micro-biomechanical behaviours. Our study incorporates detailed analysis of histology, meticulous reconstruction of musculature, and computational biomechanical analysis with models incorporating internal micro-geometry. Because internal architecture reflects the loadings to which a bone is routinely subjected, our findings are consistent with a capacity for speech in the Neanderthals.",3.234,1119

In particular, the level of genetic diversity within a society is found to have a hump-shaped effect on development outcomes in both the pre-colonial and the modern era, reflecting the trade-off between the beneficial and the detrimental effects of diversity on productivity. While the intermediate level of genetic diversity prevalent among Asian and European populations has been conducive for development, the high degree of diversity among African populations and the low degree of diversity among Native American populations have been a detrimental force in the development of these regions.",0,1237
9584888,Heterochronic processes in human evolution: an ontogenetic analysis of the hominid pelvis.,['Berge C'],American journal of physical anthropology,1998,"Changes in pelvic shape in human ontogeny and hominid phylogeny suggest that the heterochronic processes involved differ greatly from the neotenic process traditionally described in the evolution of the skull. The morphology of 150 juvenile and adult pelves of African apes, 60 juvenile and adult pelves of modern humans, two adult pelves and a juvenile hip bone of australopithecines (Sts 14, AL 288, MLD 7) was studied. Multivariate results, ontogenetic allometries, and growth curves confirm that the pelvic growth pattern in humans differs markedly from those of the African apes. The results permit the following conclusions. First, the appearance of a new feature (acetabulo-cristal buttress and cristal tubercle) at the time of human birth allows the addition of traits, such as the attainment of a proportionally narrower pelvis, with more sagittally positioned iliac blades. Pelvic proportions and orientation change progressively in early childhood as bipedalism is practiced. Other changes in pelvic proportions occur later with the adolescent growth spurt. Second, comparison of juvenile and adult australopithecines to modern humans indicates that 1) some pelvic traits of adult Australopithecus resemble those of neonate Homo; 2) the pelvic growth of Australopithecus was probably closer to that of apes, than to that of humans; and 3) prolonged growth in length of hindlimb and pelvis after sexual maturity seems to be a unique feature of Homo. The position of the acetabulo-cristal buttress and of the cristal tubercle on the ilium are similar in adult Australopithecus and neonate Homo suggesting that this feature may have been displaced later during hominid evolution. Progressive displacement of the acetabulo-cristal buttress on the ilium occurs both during hominid evolution (from Australopithecus to Homo sapiens) and human growth (from neonate to adult). This suggests peramorphic evolution of the pelvic morphology of hominids combining three processes of recapitulation (pre-displacement, acceleration and time hypermorphosis). The results lend credence to the hypothesis that no single heterochronic process accounts for all human evolutionary change; rather this reflects a combination of relative changes in growth rhythm and duration, including other perturbations, such as the appearance of new morphological features.",2.379,1709

New specimens, especially from areas less well represented in the fossil record, can inform the debate on morphological changes to the skeleton and teeth and the phylogenetic course of human evolution during this period. The mandible from the cave of Mala Balanica, Serbia has recently been re-dated to at least 400 ka, and its well-preserved dentition presents an excellent opportunity to characterize molar crown morphology at this time period, and re-examine claims for a lack of Neandertal affinities in the specimen. In this study we employ microtomography to image the internal structure of the mandibular molars (focusing on the morphology of the enamel-dentine junction, or EDJ) of the BH-1 specimen and a comparative sample (n = 141) of Homo erectus sensu lato, Homo neanderthalensis, Pleistocene Homo sapiens, and recent H. sapiens. We quantitatively assess EDJ morphology using 3D geometric morphometrics and examine the expression of discrete dental traits at the dentine surface. We also compare third molar enamel thickness in BH-1 to those of H. neanderthalensis and both Pleistocene and recent H. sapiens, and document previously unreported morphology of the BH-1 premolar and molar roots. Our results highlight the reliability of the EDJ surface for classifying hominin taxa, indicate a primitive dental morphology for BH-1 molars, and confirm a general lack of derived Neandertal features for the Balanica individual. The plesiomorphic character of BH-1 is consistent with several competing models of Middle Pleistocene hominin evolution and provides an important regional and temporal example for reconstructing morphological changes in the mandible and teeth during this time period.",3.733,266

Here we have studied the FAT1 (Homo sapiens FAT tumor-suppressor homolog 1 (Drosophila)) gene to identify its role in the tumorigenecity of the gliomas. The expression of FAT1 was found to be high in grade IV glioma cell lines (U87MG, A172, U373MG and T98G) but low in grade III glioma cell lines (GOS3 and SW1088). Two cell lines (U87MG and A172) with high FAT1 expression were chosen for in vitro FAT1-knockdown studies. FAT1 knockdown by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased migration and invasion of both the cell lines along with increased expression of the tumor-suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). Increased PDCD4 expression led to the attenuation of activator protein-1 (AP- 1) transcription by inhibiting c-Jun phosphorylation and resulted in concomitant decrease in the expression of AP-1-target genes like MMP3, VEGF-C and PLAU, the pro-inflammatory regulator COX-2 and cytokines IL1b and IL-6. Conversely, simultaneous silencing of PDCD4 and FAT1 in these cells significantly enhanced AP-1 activity and expression of its target genes, resulting in increase in mediators of inflammation and in enhanced migratory and invasive properties of the cells. We also observed a negative correlation between the expression of FAT1 and PDCD4 (P = 0.0145), a positive correlation between the expression of FAT1 and COX-2 (P = 0.048) and a similar positive trend between FAT1 and IL-6 expression in 35 primary human GBM samples studied.

Here, we apply it to the frequently recombining bacterial species Helicobacter pylori that has infected Homo sapiens since their birth in Africa and shows wide phylogeographic divergence. Multiple complete genome sequences were analyzed including sequences from Okinawa, Japan, that we recently sequenced. The newer method revealed a finer population structure than revealed by a previous method that examines only MLST housekeeping genes or a phylogenetic network analysis of the core genome. Novel subgroups were found in Europe, Amerind, and East Asia groups. Examination of genetic flux showed some singleton strains to be hybrids of subgroups and revealed evident signs of population admixture in Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia.

The deuteration level of lactate supported the proton transfer mechanism in the enzyme reaction. Differences in the enantiomeric specificity of d/l-lactacte formation observed for the DJ-1 superfamily proteins are explained by the presence of a His residue in the active site with essential Cys and Glu residues. The model for the stereospecificity was further evaluated by a molecular modeling simulation with methylglyoxal hemithioacetal superimposed on the glyoxylate hemithioacetal. The mechanism of DJ-1 glyoxalase provides a basis for understanding the His residue-based stereospecificity.

A major bottleneck of this strategy is the rapid and simultaneous expression of proteins from differential gene expression to identify eligible candidates. By searching for a generic system enabling high throughput expression analysis and purification of unknown cDNAs, we evaluated the YEpFLAG-1 yeast expression system. We have selected cDNAs encoding model proteins (eukaryotic initiation factor-5A [eIF-5A] and Homo sapiens differentiation-dependent protein-A4) and cDNA encoding an unknown protein (UP-1) for overexpression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using fusions with a peptide that changes its conformation in the presence of Ca2+ ions, the FLAG tag (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The cDNAs encoding unknown proteins originating from a directionally cloned cDNA library were expressed in all three possible reading frames. The expressed proteins were detected by an antibody directed against the FLAG tag and/or by antibodies against the model proteins. The alpha-leader sequence, encoding a yeast mating pheromone, upstream of the gene fusion site facilitates secretion into the culture supernatant. EIF-5A could be highly overexpressed and was secreted into the culture supernatant. In contrast, the Homo sapiens differentiation-dependent protein-A4 as well as the protein UP-1, whose cDNA did not match to any known gene, could not be detected in the culture supernatant. The expression product of the correct frame remained in the cells, whereas the FLAG-tagged proteins secreted into the supernatant were short, out-of-frame products. The presence of transmembrane domains or patches of hydrophobic amino acids may preclude secretion of these proteins into the culture supernatant. Subsequently, isolation and purification of the various proteins was accomplished by affinity chromatography or affinity extraction using magnetizable beads coated with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The purity of isolated proteins was in the range of 90%. In the case of unknown cDNAs, the expression product with the highest molecular mass was assumed to represent the correct reading frame. In summary, we consider the YEpFLAG-1 system to be a very efficient tool to overexpress and isolate recombinant proteins in yeast.

It remains largely unknown as to the molecular consequences of the natural genetic variation in pre-miRNAs. Here, we report that an A-->G polymorphism (rs71428439) is located in Homo sapiens miR-149 stem-loop region. This polymorphism results in a change in the structure of the miR-149 precursor. Our results showed that the genotype distribution of this polymorphism in myocardial infarction cases was significantly different from that in the control subjects. We examined the biological significance of this polymorphism on the production of mature miR-149, and we observed that the G-allelic miR-149 precursor displayed a lower production of mature miR-149 compared with the A-allelic one. Further investigations disclosed that miR-149 could withstand mitochondrial fission and apoptosis through targeting the pro-apoptotic factor p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma). Enforced expression of miR-149 promoted cell survival, whereas knockdown of miR-149 rendered cells to be sensitive to apoptotic stimulation. Intriguingly, the A to G variation led pre-miR-149 to elicit an attenuated effect on the inhibition of mitochondrial fission and apoptosis.

Reliable polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based quantification of nucleic acids in clinical samples contaminated with polymerase inhibitor heparin requires deheparinization. However, the effects of deheparinization procedure on quantification of nucleic acids remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether the deheparinization procedure completely eliminates the inhibition of amplification, while maintaining RNA integrity and technical variability of the measured microRNA levels. METHODS: Heparinized plasma from 9 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the heparin-free plasma from 58 rats were spiked with a synthetic RNA oligonucleotide and total RNA was extracted. The RNA solutions were then treated with heparinase I to remove contaminating heparin prior to reverse transcription. Levels of synthetic spike-in RNA oligonucleotide, as well as endogenous hsa-miR-1-3p and hsa-miR-208a-3p, were measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). The amplification efficiency and presence of inhibitors in individual samples were directly determined using calibration curves. RESULTS: In contrast to RNA samples from rat plasma, RNA samples derived from the CABG patient plasma contained inhibitors, which were completely eliminated by treatment with heparinase.

These two sequences were sequenced and analyzed, and the cDNA of the RPS13 gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21. We compared the nucleotide sequences of the coding region and the amino acid sequences with those of seven other mammalian species retrieved from GenBank. The cDNA fragment of the RPS13 cloned from the giant panda is 496 bp in size, containing an open-reading frame of 456 bp, encoding 151 amino acids. The length of the genomic sequence is 2277 bp, with five exons and four introns. The coding sequence shows a high degree of homology to those of Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Canis lupus familiaris, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Pan troglodytes; the degree of homology was 91.23, 94.30, 94.74, 92.11, 87.94, 87.72, and 91.45%, respectively. The homologies for the deduced amino acid sequences reached as high as 99%. Primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative RPS13 protein is 17.22325 kDa, with a theoretical pI of 10.42. Based on topology prediction, there is one protein kinase C phosphorylation site, one casein kinase II phosphorylation site, two N-myristoylation sites, and one ribosomal protein S15 signature in the RPS13 protein of the giant panda. The RPS13 gene can be expressed in E. coli and the RPS13 protein fused with the N-terminally GST-tagged form, which gave rise to the addition of an expected 43-kDa polypeptide.",0.775,1624

Through the use of LC-MS based protein expression profiling, platelets from stroke patients were analyzed and then correlated with the proteomic analyses results in the context of this disease. This study was based on patients who post ischemic stroke were admitted to hospital and had venous blood drawn within 24 hrs of the incidence. Label-free protein expression analyses of the platelets' tryptic digest was performed in triplicate on a UPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS system and ProteinLynx Global Server (v2.5, Waters) was used for tandem mass data extraction. The peptide sequences were searched against the reviewed homo sapiens database (www.uniprot.org) and the quantitation of protein variation was achieved through Progenesis LC-MS software (V4.0, Nonlinear Dynamics). These Label-free differential proteomics analysis of platelets ensured that 500 proteins were identified and 83 of these proteins were found to be statistically significant. The differentially expressed proteins are involved in various processes such as inflammatory response, cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, hematological system development and function and nucleic acid metabolism. The expressions of myeloperoxidase, arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase and histidine-rich glycoprotein are involved in cellular metabolic processes, crk-like protein and ras homolog gene family member A involved in cell signaling with vitronectin, thrombospondin 1, Integrin alpha 2b, and integrin beta 3 involved in cell adhesion. Apolipoprotein H, immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 and immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 3 are involved in structural, apolipoprotein A-I, and alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor is involved in transport, complement component 3 and clusterin is involved in immunity proteins as has been discussed.

Lipin's cellular location, protein partners, and biological function are directed by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events catalyzed by the phosphoserine phosphatase dullard. To define the determinants of dullard substrate recognition and catalysis, and hence, lipin regulation, steady-state kinetic analysis was performed on phosphoserine-bearing nonapeptides based on the phosphorylation sites of lipin. The results demonstrate that dullard shows specificity for the peptide corresponding to the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site (Ser106) of lipin with a k(cat)/K(m) of 2.9 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1).

Many petroleum-derived chemicals can be directly or functionally substituted with chemicals derived from renewable feedstocks. Several short chain organic acids may fulfill this role using their functional groups as a target for chemical catalysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce short chain carboxylic acids (C6 to C10 ) from glucose using the heterologous Homo sapiens type I fatty acid synthase (hFAS). This synthase was activated by phosphopantetheine transfereases AcpS and Sfp from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. hFAS was produced in the holo-form and produced carboxylic acids in vitro, confirmed by NADPH and ADIFAB assays. Overexpression of hFAS in a yeast FAS2 knockout strain, deficient in de novo fatty acid synthesis, demonstrated the full functional replacement of the native fungal FAS by hFAS. Two active heterologous short chain thioesterases (TEs) from Cuphea palustris (CpFatB1) and Rattus norvegicus (TEII) were evaluated for short chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Three hFAS mutants were constructed: a mutant deficient in the native TE domain, a mutant with a linked CpFatB1 TE and a mutant with a linked TEII TE. Using the native yeast fatty acid synthase for growth, the overexpression of the hFAS mutants and the short-chain TEs (linked or plasmid-based) increased in vivo caprylic acid and total SCFA production up to 64-fold (63 mg/L) and 52-fold (68 mg/L), respectively, over the native yeast levels. Combined over-expression of the phosphopantetheine transferase with the hFAS mutant resulted in C8 titers of up to 82 mg/L and total SCFA titers of up to 111 mg/L.",4.126,551

Most scientists since Darwin have been content to explain this extraordinary transformation in human consciousness by the operation of natural selection. However, the human fossil and archaeological records indicate that modern human symbolic consciousness is not the culmination of the long trend that natural selection would predict. Instead, it shows that major change in the human past has been episodic and rare and that, as far as can be determined from the archaeological record, the passage from nonsymbolic to symbolic cognition is a recent event as well as an unprecedented one. So recent, indeed, that it significantly postdates the acquisition of modern human anatomy as expressed in skeletal structure. It, thus, appears most likely that the biological (neural) capacity underwriting the radically new behavioral mode arose as an incidental exaptation in the same process that produced the new skeletal structure of Homo sapiens, but that it lay unexpressed until it was",1.542,1738

Several models exist to predict specific PTMs, from manually detected patterns to machine learning methods. On one hand, the manual detection of patterns does not provide the most efficient classifiers and requires an important workload, and on the other hand, models built by machine learning methods are hard to interpret and do not increase biological knowledge. Therefore, we developed a novel method based on patterns discovery and decision trees to predict PTMs. The proposed algorithm builds a decision tree, by coupling the C4.5 algorithm with genetic algorithms, producing high-performance white box classifiers. Our method was tested on the initiator methionine cleavage (IMC) and N(alpha)-terminal acetylation (N-Ac), two of the most common PTMs. RESULTS: The resulting classifiers perform well when compared with existing models. On a set of eukaryotic proteins, they display a cross-validated Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.83 (IMC) and 0.65 (N-Ac). When used to predict potential substrates of N-terminal acetyltransferaseB and N-terminal acetyltransferaseC, our classifiers display better performance than the state of the art. Moreover, we present an analysis of the model predicting IMC for Homo sapiens proteins and demonstrate that we are able to extract experimentally known facts without prior knowledge. Those results validate the fact that our method produces white box models.

Although there is a considerable volume of in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrating first metatarsal inversion around its longitudinal axis with dorsiflexion, little is known regarding the applicability of specific morphometrics to these motions. METHODS: Nine distinctive osseous characteristics in the metatarsal head and phalanx were selected based on their location, geometry, and perceived functional relationship to previous studies describing metatarsal motion as inversion with dorsiflexion. The prevalences of the chosen characteristics were determined in a cohort of 21 randomly selected skeletal specimens, 19 of which were provided by the anatomical preparation office at the University of California, San Diego, and two of which were in the possession of one of us (M.D.). RESULTS: The frequency of occurrence of each selected morphological characteristic in this sample and the relevant summary statistics confirm a strong association between the selected features and a conceptual two-axis kinematic model of the metatarsophalangeal joint.

The complex has a modular architecture (Head, Middle, and Tail) and cryoelectron microscopy analysis suggested that it undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon interactions with activators and RNAP II. These rearrangements have been proposed to play a role in the assembly of the preinitiation complex and also to contribute to the regulatory mechanism of Mediator. In analogy to many regulatory and transcriptional proteins, we reasoned that Mediator might also utilize intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to facilitate structural transitions and transmit transcriptional signals. Indeed, a high prevalence of IDRs was found in various subunits of Mediator from both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens, especially in the Tail and the Middle modules. The level of disorder increases from yeast to man, although in both organisms it significantly exceeds that of multiprotein complexes of a similar size. IDRs can contribute to Mediator's function in three different ways: they can individually serve as target sites for multiple partners having distinctive structures; they can act as malleable linkers connecting globular domains that impart modular functionality on the complex; and they can also facilitate assembly and disassembly of complexes in response to regulatory signals. Short segments of IDRs, termed molecular recognition features (MoRFs) distinguished by a high protein-protein interaction propensity, were identified in 16 and 19 subunits of the yeast and human Mediator, respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the functional roles of 11 MoRFs have been experimentally verified, and those in the Med8/Med18/Med20 and Med7/Med21 complexes were structurally confirmed. Although the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens Mediator sequences are only weakly conserved, the arrangements of the disordered regions and their embedded interaction sites are quite similar in the two organisms.

In both species, the observation of an action, regardless of how performed, activated occipitotemporal, intraparietal, and ventral premotor cortex, bilaterally. In humans, the observation of actions done with simple tools yielded an additional, specific activation of a rostral sector of the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). This latter site was considered human-specific, as it was not observed in monkey IPL for any of the tool videos presented, even after monkeys had become proficient in using a rake or pliers through extensive training. In conclusion, while the observation of a grasping hand activated similar regions in humans and monkeys, an additional specific sector of IPL devoted to tool use has evolved in Homo sapiens, although tool-specific neurons might reside in the monkey grasping regions.

(Curr Biol 17(19):1663-1668, 2007) found in a self-control test in which choice was between a smaller, immediately delivered food and a larger, delayed food, that chimpanzees preferred the larger reward (self-control); humans, however, preferred the smaller reward (impulsivity). They attributed their results to a species difference in self-control. In Experiment 1, monkeys (long-tailed macaques) were exposed to a self-control task in two conditions: where the food was hidden under differently colored bowls and where it was visible. When these two conditions were compared, choice shifted from greater preference for the impulsive alternative in the hidden condition to greater preference for the self-control alternative in the visible condition. Additionally, in both conditions, preference shifted from self-control to impulsivity over sessions. These results were explained in terms of the reversed-contingency effect (a propensity to reach for more over less when rewards are visible) and not to a capacity for self-control. In Experiment 2, humans that demonstrated preference for more over less in choice preferred the impulsive alternative when choice to either alternative was followed by the same intertrial interval-a preference that accelerates trial rates relative to preference of the self-control alternative. When trial rates were equated so that neither choice accelerated session's end, humans demonstrated self-control. These results suggest that Rosati et al.'s demonstration of impulsivity in humans was due to participants' desire to minimize session time.",2.582,120

Given that human embryos are Kantian persons from the time of their conception, killing them to obtain their cells for research fails to treat them as ends in themselves. This argument assumes two points that are rather contentious given a Kantian framework. First, the argument assumes that when Kant maintains that humanity must be treated as an end in itself, he means to argue that all members of the species Homo sapiens must be treated as ends in themselves; that is, that Kant regards personhood as co-extensive with belonging to the species Homo sapiens. Second, the argument assumes that the event of conception is causally responsible for the genesis of a Kantian person and that, therefore, an embryo is a Kantian person from the time of its conception.

One such site is the Homo sapiens sapiens cairn burial excavated in 1971 from the Yuha desert, Imperial County, California. Radiocarbon analysis of caliche coating one of the bones of the skeleton yielded a radiocarbon age of 21,500 +/- 1,000 yr BP, while radiocarbon and uranium series analyses of caliche coating a cairn boulder yielded ages of 22,125 +/- 400 and 19,000 +/- 3,000 yr BP, respectively. The late Pleistocene age assignment to the Yuha burial has been challenged by comparing the cultural context of the burial with other cairn burials in the same region, on the basis of the site's geomorphological context and from radiocarbon analyses of soil caliches. In rebuttal, arguments in defence of the original age assignment have been presented as well as an amino acid recemization analysis on the Yuha skeleton indicating an age of 23,600 +/- 2,600 yr BP. The tandem accelerator mass spectrometer at the University of Arizona has now been used to measure the ratio of 14C/13C in several organic and inorganic fractions of post-cranial bone from the Yuha H. sapiens sapiens skeleton.

By considering the sign of each two-node feedback interaction, we examined the enrichment of the three types of two-node feedbacks [positive-positive (PP), negative-negative (NN) and positive-negative (PN)]. We found that PN is enriched in the network of A.thaliana, NN in the network of S.cerevisiae and PP and NN in the network of H.sapiens.

The interfaces between us and our environment are blurred, but comprise time, biorhythms, prokaryotic organisms, sensory (auditory, visual, tactile, taste and smell), conjoint movement, endocrine with various external hormonal through food and contaminants, the reflection of soil and rock composition in the microbes, plants, insects and animals that we eat (our biogeology) and much more. We have sought ways to optimise our health through highly anthropocentric means, which have proven inadequate. Accumulated ecosystem change may now overwhelm our health. On these accounts, more integrative approaches and partnerships for health care practice are required.",1.699,909

In this work, we generated engineered Escherichia coli biosensor strains that incorporate the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the beta-subtype estrogen receptors (ERbeta) from Solea solea (sole), and Sus scrofa (pig). These strains indicate the presence of ligands for these receptors by changes in growth phenotype, and can differentiate agonist from antagonist and give a rough indication of binding affinity via dose-response curves. The resulting strains were compared with our previously reported Homo sapiens ERbeta biosensor strain. In initial tests, all three of the strains correctly identified estrogenic test compounds with a high degree of certainly (Z' typically greater than 0.5), including the weakly binding test compound bisphenol A (BPA) (Z'  approximately  0.1-0.3). The modular design of the sensing element in this strain allows quick development of new species-based biosensors by simple LBD swapping, suggesting its use in initial comparative analysis of EDC impacts across multiple species. Interestingly, the growth phenotypes of the biosensor strains indicate similar binding for highly estrogenic control compounds, but suggest differences in ligand binding for more weakly binding EDCs.",3.197,1148

The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effects of alpha-LA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and insulin sensitivity in LYRM1 overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes and to explore the underlying mechanism. Pretreatment with alpha-LA significantly increased both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, while intracellular ROS levels in LYRM1 overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes were decreased. These changes were accompanied by a marked upregulation in expression of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and serine phosphorylation of Akt following treatment with alpha-LA. These results indicated that alpha-LA protects 3T3-L1 adipocytes from LYRM1-induced insulin resistance partially via its capacity to restore mitochondrial function and/or increase phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt.",3.212,1244

The wild-type enzyme shows substrate promiscuity and can also use the AdoMet-analog AdoPropen for allyl transfer. Here we report on engineering GlaTgs2 to enhance the activity on AdoPropen. A mutational analysis, involving an alanine scan of 10 residues located around the active site, was performed. Positions V34 and S38 were identified as mutational hot spots and analyzed in greater detail by testing NNK libraries. Kinetic analysis and thermostability measurements revealed V34A as the best variant of GlaTgs2, with a  approximately 10-fold improved specificity for AdoPropen. Double mutants did not yield additional improvements due to low catalytic efficiencies and thermal destabilization. Homologous Tgs enzymes from Homo sapiens and G. intestinalis were also investigated regarding their catalytic activity on AdoPropen. While neither the human wild-type (WT) enzyme nor any of its variants showed activity on AdoPropen, the homologue from G. intestinalis (GinTgs) was remarkably active on AdoPropen. Introducing the best substitution at the homologous position led to variant T34A with  approximately 40-fold higher specificity for AdoPropen than the original GlaTgs2 WT.",2.537,846

Mutations in human XPD are associated with several inherited diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy. We performed a comparative analysis of XPD from Homo sapiens and Chaetomium thermophilum (a closely related thermostable fungal orthologue) to decipher the different molecular prerequisites necessary for either transcription or DNA repair. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that mutations in the 4Fe4S cluster domain of XPD abrogate the NER function of TFIIH and do not affect its transcriptional activity. We show that the p44-dependent activation of XPD is promoted by the stimulation of its ATPase activity. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrate that XPD requires DNA binding, ATPase, and helicase activity to function in NER. In contrast, these enzymatic properties are dispensable for transcription initiation. XPD helicase is thus exclusively devoted to NER and merely acts as a structural scaffold to maintain TFIIH integrity during transcription.",9.343,897

In this study, a short-hairpin RNA-based RNA interference approach was used to inhibit the expression of CHMP5 in the leukemic cell line U937. After CHMP5 was inhibited, antibody microarray and western blot analysis were used to study the changes in the programmed cell death (PCD) pathway. PCD can be classified into three types: apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Results showed that caspase 3 was activated in CHMP5-deficient U937 cells, indicating that the apoptotic pathway was activated, although neither the intrinsic nor the extrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated. Our results also showed that the Granzyme B/Perforin apoptotic pathway was activated by CHMP5 silencing. Necrosis is activated by caspase-independent executioners. In this study, we showed that the apoptosis-inducing protein-mediated necrotic PCD pathway is activated after CHMP5 inhibition. It was found that autophagic PCD did not occur in CHMP5-deficient U937 cells.

Due to the emergence of multidrug resistance and cross-resistance, S. Pyogenes is becoming more pathogenic and dangerous. In the present study, an in silico comparative analysis of total 65 metabolic pathways of the host (Homo sapiens) and the pathogen was performed. Initially, 486 paralogous enzymes were identified so that they can be removed from possible drug target list. The 105 enzymes of the biochemical pathways of S. pyogenes from the KEGG metabolic pathway database were compared with the proteins from the Homo sapiens by performing a BLASTP search against the non-redundant database restricted to the Homo sapiens subset. Out of these, 83 enzymes were identified as non-human homologous while 30 enzymes of inadequate amino acid length were removed for further processing. Essential enzymes were finally mined from remaining 53 enzymes. Finally, 28 essential enzymes were identified in S. pyogenes SF370 (serotype M1). In subcellular localization study, 18 enzymes were predicted with cytoplasmic localization and ten enzymes with the membrane localization. These ten enzymes with putative membrane localization should be of particular interest. Acyl-carrier-protein S-malonyltransferase, DNA polymerase III subunit beta and dihydropteroate synthase are novel drug targets and thus can be used to design potential inhibitors against S. pyogenes infection. 3D structure of dihydropteroate synthase was modeled and validated that can be used for virtual screening and interaction study of potential inhibitors with the target enzyme.",0.662,227

Humans are not the only primates to share, and observations from the wild have long documented food sharing behavior in our closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). However, few controlled studies have been made in which groups of Pan are introduced to food items that may be shared or monopolized by a first food possessor, and very few studies have examined what happens to these sharing patterns if the food in question is a highly attractive, monopolizable food source. The one study to date to include food quality as the independent variable used different types of food as high- and low-value items, making differences in food divisibility and size potentially confounding factors. It was the aim of the present study to examine the sharing behavior of groups of captive chimpanzees and bonobos when introducing the same type of food (branches) manipulated to be of 2 different degrees of desirability (with or without syrup). Results showed that the large majority of food transfers in both species came about as sharing in which group members were allowed to cofeed or remove food from the stock of the food possessor, and the introduction of high-value food resulted in more sharing, not less. Food sharing behavior differed between species in that chimpanzees displayed significantly more begging behavior than bonobos. Bonobos, instead, engaged in sexual invitations, which the chimpanzees never did. (PsycINFO Database Record",1.52,780

In this contribution, I use dentally mature samples of extant hominoid taxa (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and Hylobates lar) to investigate a) the temporal relationship between spheno-occipital fusion and dental maturity, b) whether there is an association between the degree of spheno-occipital fusion and relative age, c) whether there are differences in relative timing of spheno-occipital fusion between taxa, and d) whether there are sex differences in the relative timing of spheno-occipital fusion. Results suggest that a) a substantial proportion of dentally mature wild-shot chimpanzee, gorilla and orang-utans have unfused or partially fused spheno-occipital synchondoses, b) there is an association between the degree of spheno-occipital fusion and age, c) there are interspecific differences in the timing of spheno-occipital fusion, and d) there are significant sex differences in spheno-occipital fusion in chimpanzees, orang-utans and gibbons. Thus, contrary to previous work, degree of spheno-occipital fusion is a potentially useful indicator of relative maturity, especially in great ape taxa.",2.379,844

This social structure is maintained because dominant males do not monopolize females and, thus, allow subordinate males to mate, and human females are not generally promiscuous. Although apes show great variation in mating systems, the human-type mating system is unique among primates. The mating systems of apes and humans have evolved in response to their adaptation to different ecological conditions. We created and analyzed a mathematical model to investigate the conditions for each type of mating system to evolve. We focused on the mating strategy of alpha males and the mating and grouping strategies of females. We defined the human-type mating system as one with multiple-male-multiple-female groups in which alpha males do not monopolize females and females are not promiscuous. We demonstrated that the human-type mating system could evolve when a large group is advantageous and the cost of female promiscuity is great. Moreover, the human- and Pan-type mating systems can be bistable. Our results shed light on the origin of the human family.",2.116,1334

Mutations in the mtDNA have been shown to be associated with dozens of unexplained disorders and the information contained in the mtDNA should be of major relevance to the understanding of many human diseases. Within this paper we describe the Italian initiative of the Human Proteome Project dedicated to mitochondria as part of both programs: chromosome-centric (c-HPP) and Biology/Disease (B/D-HPP). The mt-HPP has finally shifted the attention of the HUPO community outside the nuclear chromosomes with the general purpose to highlight the mitochondrial processes influencing the human health.

An ordered gene list is produced, such that the probability that the genes are functionally associated exponentially decays with their distance on the list. This list presents a biological logic, evinced by the selective enrichment of successive intervals with Gene Ontology terms or KEGG pathways. Transcriptograms are expression profiles obtained by taking the average of gene expression over neighboring genes on this list. Transcriptograms enhance reproducibility and precision for expression measurements of functionally correlated gene sets. RESULTS: Here we present an ordering list for Homo sapiens and apply the transcriptogram profiling method to different datasets. We show that this method enhances experiment reproducibility and enhances signal. We applied the method to a diabetes study by Hwang and collaborators, which focused on expression differences between cybrids produced by the hybridization of mitochondria of diabetes mellitus donors with osteosarcoma cell lines, depleted of mitochondria. We found that the transcriptogram method revealed significant differential expression in gene sets linked to blood coagulation and wound healing pathways, and also to gene sets that do not represent any metabolic pathway or Gene Ontology term. These gene sets are connected to ECM-receptor interaction and secreted proteins. CONCLUSION: The transcriptogram profiling method provided an automatic way to define sets of genes with correlated expression, reduce noise in genome-wide transcription profiles, and enhance measure reproducibility and sensitivity. These advantages enabled biologic interpretation and pointed to differentially expressed gene sets in diabetes mellitus which were not previously defined.",3.986,858

Furthermore, some features known from Africa were examined with regard to their occurrence and variability in China. Although the variability might change due to new finds, the present results for some features point to larger morphological spectra in the African than in the Chinese archaic Homo sapiens. It is furthermore remarkable that the early modern Chinese in many features show deviations from the pattern of archaic Homo sapiens of this region and exhibit broader spectra similar to those seen in African archaic and early modern Homo sapiens.",0,200

We have characterized the faecal microbiota of 60 guinea pigs using Illumina shotgun metagenomics, and used this data to compile a gene catalogue of its prevalent microbiota. Subsequently, we compared the guinea pig microbiome to existing human gut metagenome data from the MetaHIT project. RESULTS: We found that the bacterial richness obtained for human samples was lower than for guinea pig samples. The intestinal microbiotas of both species were dominated by the two phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, but at genus level, the majority of identified genera (320 of 376) were differently abundant in the two hosts. For example, the guinea pig contained considerably more of the mucin-degrading Akkermansia, as well as of the methanogenic archaea Methanobrevibacter than found in humans. Most microbiome functional categories were less abundant in guinea pigs than in humans.

Our previous studies indicate that the NRP/B-BTB/POZ domain is involved in the dimerization of NRP/B and in a complex formation with the tumor suppressor, retinoblastoma protein. Although much evidence supports the potential role of NRP/B as a tumor suppressor, the molecular mechanisms of NRP/B action on E2F transcription factors have not been elucidated. METHODS: Three-dimensional modeling of NRP/B was used to generate point mutations in the BTB/Kelch domains. Tet-on inducible NRP/B expression was established. The NRP/B deficient breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was generated using lentiviral shNRP/B to evaluate the effect of NRP/B on cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Immunoprecipitation was performed to verify the interaction of NRP/B with E2F and histone deacetylase (HDAC-1), and the expression level of NRP/B protein was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Changes in cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Transcriptional activities of E2F transcription factors were measured by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. RESULTS: Ectopic overexpression of NRP/B demonstrated that the NRP/B-BTB/POZ domain plays a critical role in E2F-mediated transcriptional activity. Point mutations within the BTB/POZ domain restored E2-promoter activity inhibited by NRP/B. Loss of NRP/B enhanced the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Endogenous NRP/B interacted with E2F and HDAC1. Treatement with an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), abolished the NRP/B-mediated suppression of E2-promoter activity. Gain or loss of NRP/B in HeLa cells confirmed the transcriptional repressive capability of NRP/B on the E2F target genes, Cyclin E and HsORC (Homo sapiens Origin Recognition Complex). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that NRP/B acts as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the co-repressors, HDAC1, providing new insight into the molecular mechanisms of NRP/B on tumor suppression.",0,960

Just focusing on the roles of micro RNAs (miRNAs), they have been found to be part of several intra-pathway regulatory motifs. However, inter-pathway regulatory mechanisms have been often neglected and require further investigation. RESULTS: In this paper we present the result of a systems biology study aimed at analyzing a high-level inter-pathway regulatory motif called Pathway Protection Loop, not previously described, in which miRNAs seem to play a crucial role in the successful behavior and activation of a pathway. Through the automatic analysis of a large set of public available databases, we found statistical evidence that this inter-pathway regulatory motif is very common in several classes of KEGG Homo Sapiens pathways and concurs in creating a complex regulatory network involving several pathways connected by this specific motif. The role of this motif seems also confirmed by a deeper review of other research activities on selected representative pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous studies suggested transcriptional regulation mechanism at the pathway level such as the Pathway Protection Loop, a high-level analysis like the one proposed in this paper is still missing. The understanding of higher-level regulatory motifs could, as instance, lead to new approaches in the identification of therapeutic targets because it could unveil new and",1.212,1133

Computer science,2015,"CRISPR/Cas9 is emerging as one of the most-used methods of genome modification in organisms ranging from bacteria to human cells. However, the efficiency of editing varies tremendously site-to-site. A recent report identified a novel motif, called the 3'GG motif, which substantially increases the efficiency of editing at all sites tested in C. elegans. Furthermore, they highlighted that previously published gRNAs with high editing efficiency also had this motif. I designed a python command-line tool, ngg2, to identify 3'GG gRNA sites from indexed FASTA files. As a proof-of-concept, I screened for these motifs in six model genomes: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. I also scanned the genomes of pig (Sus scrofa) and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) to demonstrate the utility in non-model organisms. I identified more than 60 million single match 3'GG motifs in these genomes. Greater than 61% of all protein coding genes in the reference genomes had at least one unique 3'GG gRNA site overlapping an exon. In particular, more than 96% of mouse and 93% of human protein coding genes have at least one unique, overlapping 3'GG gRNA. These identified sites can be used as a starting point in gRNA selection, and the ngg2 tool provides an important ability to identify 3'GG editing sites in any species with an available genome sequence.",0,910

Marked variation in repertoire size has been noted among species. However, research on T2Rs is still limited and the mechanisms underlying the evolution of vertebrate T2Rs remain poorly understood. In the present study, we analyzed the structure and features of the protein encoded by the forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) T2R16 and submitted the gene sequence to NCBI GenBank. The results showed that the full coding DNA sequence (CDS) of musk deer T2R16 (GenBank accession No. KP677279) was 906 bp, encoding 301 amino acids, which contained ATG start codon and TGA stop codon, with a calculated molecular weight of 35.03 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.56. The T2R16 protein receptor had seven conserved transmembrane regions. Hydrophobicity analysis showed that most amino acid residues in T2R16 protein were hydrophobic, and the grand average of hydrophobicity (GRAVY) was 0.657. Phylogenetic analysis based on this gene revealed that forest musk deer had the closest association with sheep (Ovis aries), as compared to cow (Bos taurus), Tursiops truncatus, and other species, whereas it was genetically farthest from humans (Homo sapiens).

Here, we use the same conceptual framework to describe locomotor performances in Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus domesticus, Canis familiaris, Equus caballus, and Homo sapiens We show that locomotion is a consistent biomarker of age-related changes, with an asymmetrical pattern throughout life, regardless of the type of effort or its duration. However, there is variation (i) among species for the same mode of locomotion, (ii) within species for different modes of locomotion, and (iii) among individuals of the same species for the same mode of locomotion. Age-related patterns are modulated by genetic (such as selective breeding) as well as environmental conditions (such as temperature). However, in all cases, the intersection of the rising developmental phase and the declining senescent phase reveals neither a sharp transition nor a plateau, but a smooth transition, emphasizing a crucial moment: the age at peak performance. This transition may define a specific target for future investigations on the dynamics of such biological interactions.",0,15
17005332,The evolution of retrotransposon regulatory regions and its consequences on the Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens host genomes.,"['Fablet M', 'Rebollo R', 'Biemont C', 'Vieira C']",Gene,2007,"It has now been established that transposable elements (TEs) make up a variable, but significant proportion of the genomes of all organisms, from Bacteria to Vertebrates. However, in addition to their quantitative importance, there is increasing evidence that TEs also play a functional role within the genome. In particular, TE regulatory regions can be viewed as a large pool of potential promoter sequences for host genes. Studying the evolution of regulatory region of TEs in different genomic contexts is therefore a fundamental aspect of understanding how a genome works. In this paper, we first briefly describe what is currently known about the regulation of TE copy number and activity in genomes, and then focus on TE regulatory regions and their evolution. We restrict ourselves to retrotransposons, which are the most abundant class of eukaryotic TEs, and analyze their evolution and the subsequent consequences for host genomes. Particular attention is paid to much-studied representatives of the Vertebrates and Invertebrates, Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively, for which high quality sequenced genomes are available.",2.138,381

Previous studies have uncovered a genetic predisposition for variation of age at maturity with moderate heritability, thus suggesting a polygenic or complex nature of this trait. The aim of this study was to identify associated genetic loci, genes and ultimately specific sequence variants conferring sea age at maturity in salmon. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) using a pool sequencing approach (20 individuals per river and phenotype) of male salmon returning to rivers as sexually mature either after one sea winter (2009) or three sea winters (2011) in six rivers in Norway. The study revealed one major selective sweep, which covered 76 significant SNPs in which 74 were found in a 370 kb region of chromosome 25. Genotyping other smolt year classes of wild and domesticated salmon confirmed this finding. Genotyping domesticated fish narrowed the haplotype region to four SNPs covering 2386 bp, containing the vgll3 gene, including two missense mutations explaining 33-36% phenotypic variation. A single locus was found to have a highly significant role in governing sea age at maturation in this species. The SNPs identified may be both used as markers to guide breeding for late maturity in salmon aquaculture and in monitoring programs of wild salmon. Interestingly, a SNP in proximity of the VGLL3 gene in humans (Homo sapiens), has previously been linked to age at puberty suggesting a conserved mechanism for timing of puberty in vertebrates.",7.528,735

These new data show that the pattern of morphological change in the hominid lineage was mosaic. Adaptations essential to bipedalism appeared early, but some locomotor features changed much later. Relative to the highly derived postcrania of the earliest hominids, the craniodental complex was quite primitive (i.e., like the reconstructed last common ancestor with the African great apes). The pattern of craniodental change among successively younger species of Hominidae implies extensive parallel evolution between at least two lineages in features related to mastication. Relative brain size increased slightly among successively younger species of Australopithecus, expanded significantly with the appearance of Homo, but within early Homo remained at about half the size of Homo sapiens for almost a million years. Many apparent trends in human evolution may actually be due to the accumulation of relatively rapid shifts in successive species.",9.674,1856

19758680,The prehistory of handedness: archaeological data and comparative ethology.,['Uomini NT'],Journal of human evolution,2009,"Homo sapiens sapiens displays a species wide lateralised hand preference, with 85% of individuals in all populations being right-handed for most manual actions. In contrast, no other great ape species shows such strong and consistent population level biases, indicating that extremes of both direction and strength of manual laterality (i.e., species-wide right-handedness) may have emerged after divergence from the last common ancestor. To reconstruct the hand use patterns of early hominins, laterality is assessed in prehistoric artefacts. Group right side biases are well established from the Neanderthals onward, while patchy evidence from older fossils and artefacts indicates a preponderance of right-handed individuals. Individual hand preferences and group level biases can occur in chimpanzees and other apes for skilled tool use and food processing. Comparing these findings with human ethological data on spontaneous hand use reveals that the great ape clade (including humans) probably has a common effect at the individual level, such that a person can vary from ambidextrous to completely lateralised depending on the action. However, there is currently no theoretical model to explain this result. The degree of task complexity and bimanual complementarity have been proposed as factors affecting lateralisation strength. When primatology meets palaeoanthropology, the evidence suggests species-level right-handedness may have emerged through the social transmission of increasingly complex, bimanually differentiated, tool using activities.",3.733,1836

In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic rearranged IGHV gene is strongly associated with patient outcome. Correct determination of this parameter strictly depends on the comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the clonotypic rearranged IGHV gene with that of the closest germline counterpart. Consequently, changes in the reference directories could, in principle, affect the correct interpretation of the IGHV mutational status in CLL. To this end, we analyzed 8066 productive IG heavy chain (IGH) rearrangement sequences from our consortium both before and after the latest update of the IMGT/V-QUEST reference directory. Differences were identified in 405 cases (5 % of the cohort). In 291/405 sequences (71.9 %), changes concerned only the IGHV gene or allele name, whereas a change in the percent germline identity (%GI) was noted in 114/405 (28.1 %) sequences; in 50/114 (43.8 %) sequences, changes in the %GI led to a change in the mutational set. In conclusion, recent changes in the IMGT reference directories affected the interpretation of SHM in a sizeable number of IGH rearrangement sequences from CLL patients. This indicates that both physicians and researchers should consider a re-evaluation of IG sequence data, especially for those IGH rearrangement sequences that, up to date, have a GI close to 98 %, where caution is warranted.",2.227,841

If a woman has copulated recently with a man other than her long-term partner, her reproductive tract may contain the sperm of both men, initiating sperm competition (whereby sperm from multiple males compete to fertilize an egg). Should the woman become pregnant, her long-term partner is at risk of cuckoldry-investing unwittingly in offspring to whom he is not genetically related. Previous research in humans (Homo sapiens) and in nonhuman animals suggests that males have evolved tactics such as partner-directed sexual coercion that reduce the risk of cuckoldry. The current research provides preliminary evidence that mated men (n = 223) at greater risk of partner EPC, measured as having spent a greater proportion of time apart from their partner since the couple's last in-pair copulation, more frequently perform partner-directed sexually coercive behaviors. This relationship is moderated, however, by men's perceived risk of partner EPC, such that the correlation between the proportion of time spent apart since last in-pair copulation and sexually coercive behaviors remains significant only for those men who perceive themselves to be at some risk of partner EPC.

Kinetic studies of Bacillus subtilis and human ASL with a new substrate analog, adenosine phosphonobutyric acid, 2'(3'), 5'-diphosphate (APBADP), show that it acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to either substrate (K(I) approximately 0.1 microM), indicating that the two substrates occupy the same active site. Binding studies show that both the B. subtilis and human ASLs bind up to 4 mol of APBADP per mole of enzyme tetramer and that both enzymes exhibit cooperativity: negative for B. subtilis ASL and positive for human ASL. Mutant B. subtilis ASLs, with replacements for residues previously identified as critical for catalysis, bind the substrate analog similarly to wild-type ASL. Two serines in a flexible loop of ASL have been proposed to play roles in catalysis because they are close to the substrate in the crystal structure of Escherichia coli ASL. We have now mutated the corresponding serines to alanines in B. subtilis and human ASL to evaluate their involvement in enzyme function. Kinetic data reveal that human Ser(289) and B. subtilis Ser(262) and Ser(263) are essential for catalysis, while the ability of these Ser mutants to bind APBADP suggests that they do not contribute to substrate affinity. Although these serines are not visible in the crystal structure of human adenylosuccinate lyase complexed with substrate or products (PDB #2VD6), they may be interacting with the active sites.",0,517

Thus, successful infection depends on the pathogen's ability to manipulate the biological pathways and processes of the organism it infects. Interactions between HIV-encoded and human proteins provide one means by which HIV-1 can connect into cellular pathways to carry out these survival processes. RESULTS: We developed and applied a computational approach to predict interactions between HIV and human proteins based on structural similarity of 9 HIV-1 proteins to human proteins having known interactions. Using functional data from RNAi studies as a filter, we generated over 2000 interaction predictions between HIV proteins and 406 unique human proteins. Additional filtering based on Gene Ontology cellular component annotation reduced the number of predictions to 502 interactions involving 137 human proteins. We find numerous known interactions as well as novel interactions showing significant functional relevance based on supporting Gene Ontology and literature evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the interplay between HIV-1 and its human host will help in understanding the viral lifecycle and the ways in which this virus is able to manipulate its host. The results shown here provide a potential set of interactions that are amenable to further experimental manipulation as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",2.181,243

Lumbar lordosis is unique to the human spine and is necessary to facilitate our upright posture. However, decreased lumbar lordosis and increased thoracic kyphosis are hallmarks of an aging human spinal column. The unique upright posture and lordotic lumbar curvature of the human spine suggest that an understanding of the evolution of the human spinal column, and the unique anatomical features that support lumbar lordosis may provide insight into spine health and degeneration. Considering evolution of the skeleton in isolation from other scientific studies provides a limited picture for clinicians. The evolution and development of human lumbar lordosis highlight the interdependence of pelvic structure and lumbar lordosis. Studies of fossils of human lineage demonstrate a convergence on the degree of lumbar lordosis and the number of lumbar vertebrae in modern Homo sapiens. Evolution and spine mechanics research show that lumbar lordosis is dictated by pelvic incidence, spinal musculature, vertebral wedging, and disc health. The evolution, mechanics, and biology research all point to the importance of spinal posture and flexibility in supporting optimal health. However, surgical management of postural deformity has focused on restoring posture at the expense of flexibility. It is possible that the need for complex and costly spinal fixation can be eliminated by developing tools for early identification of patients at risk for postural deformities through patient history (genetics, mechanics, and environmental exposure) and tracking postural changes over time.",2.105,954

This interpretation of sinus evolution rests on two assumptions: that increased craniofacial pneumatization is an adaptation to lower ambient temperatures, and that Neanderthals have relatively large sinuses. Analysis of humans, other primates, and rodents, however, suggests that the first assumption is suspect; at least the maxillary sinus undergoes a significant reduction in volume in extreme cold, in both wild and laboratory conditions. The second assumption, that Neanderthal sinuses are large, extensive, or even 'hyperpneumatized,' has held sway since the first specimen was described and has been interpreted as the causal explanation for some of the distinctive aspects of Neanderthal facial form, but has never been evaluated with respect to scaling. To test the latter assumption, previously published measurements from two-dimensional (2D) X-rays and new three-dimensional (3D) data from computed tomography (CT) of Neanderthals and temperate-climate European Homo sapiens are regressed against cranial size to determine the relative size of their sinuses. The 2D data reveal a degree of craniofacial pneumatization in Neanderthals that is both commensurate with the size of the cranium and comparable in scale with that seen in temperate climate H. sapiens. The 3D analysis of CT data from a smaller sample supports this conclusion. These results suggest that the distinctive Neanderthal face cannot be interpreted as a direct result of increased pneumatization, nor is it likely to be an adaptation to resist cold stress; an alternative explanation is thus required.",3.733,1443

Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify the differential proteins. Transfection of colorectal cancer lovo cells was performed with the differential protein cDNA, and the changes of cell biological behavior was observed. RESULTS: Significant difference in protein expression was found on two-dimensional electrophoresis. Thirteen differential protein spots were analysed and identified.

Because of its relevance to BioMedicine, we have sought to obtain a detailed characterization of AM Omics in Homo sapiens, namely its Genomics and Evolution, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Interactomics, Oncogenomics, and Pharmacogenomics. METHODS: This project exploited the methodology commonly used in Computational Biology (i.e., mining of many omics databases of the web) as well as the High Throughput biomolecular analytical techniques. RESULTS: In Homo sapiens AM is comprised of 342 protein-encoding genes (possessing either anti- or pro-apoptotic activity, or a regulatory function) and 110 MIR-encoding genes targeting them: some have a critical role within the system (core AM nodes), others perform tissue-, pathway-, or disease-specific functions (peripheral AM nodes). By overlapping the cancer type-specific AM mutation map in the fourteen most frequent cancers in western societies (breast, colon, kidney, leukaemia, liver, lung, neuroblastoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, thyroid, and uterus) to their transcriptome, proteome and interactome in the same tumour type, we have identified the most prominent AM molecular alterations within each class. The comparison of the fourteen mutated AM networks (both protein- as MIR-based) has allowed us to pinpoint the hubs with a general and critical role in tumour development and, conversely, in cell physiology: in particular, we found that some of these had already been used as targets for pharmacological anticancer therapy. For a better understanding of the relationship between AM molecular alterations and pharmacological induction of apoptosis in cancer, we examined the expression of AM genes in K562 and SH-SY5Y after anticancer treatment. CONCLUSION: We believe that our data on the Apoptotic Machinery will lead to the identification of new cancer genes and to the discovery of new biomarkers, which could then be used to profile cancers for diagnostic purposes and to pinpoint new targets for pharmacological therapy.

A capture receptor, formed by replacing aa residues 261-370 of the human thyrotropin receptor with residues 261-329 from rat lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor and fixed to microtiter plates, binds one arm of the autoantibody. The second arm bridges to the signal receptor constructed from thyrotropin receptor (aa 21-261) and secretory alkaline phosphatase (aa 1-519) inducing chemiluminescence. The working range of the assay is from 0.3 IU/l to 50 IU/l with a cutoff of 0.54 IU/l and functional sensitivity of 0.3 IU/l. Sensitivity and specificity are 99.8 and 99.1%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.998. The low grey zone is from 0.3-0.54 IU/l. The stimulatory character of the assayed antibodies is shown through a good correlation (r=0.7079, p<10(-7)) to serum T4 levels of untreated patients. In Graves' disease, titers are increased in associated eye disease. In 3 hypothyroid patients with sera positive in the thyrotropin receptor competition assay and in the blocking bioassay, antibodies are not detected by the Bridge Assay, while the monoclonal blocking antibody K1-70 was detected. In Hashimoto disease thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies are detected in some patients, but not in goiter. This Bridge Assay delivers good diagnostic accuracy for identification of Graves' disease patients. Its high sensitivity may facilitate early detection of onset, remission, or recurrence of Graves' disease enabling timely adaption of the treatment.Human genes: TSHR, Homo sapiens, acc. no.

For example, the NF-kappaB subunit RelA/p65 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, whereas p53 induces apoptosis. One potential explanation may be their co-regulation by common cellular factors: inhibitor of Apoptosis Stimulating p53 Protein (iASPP) is one such common regulator of both RelA/p65 and p53. Here we show that iASPP is a novel substrate of caspases in response to apoptotic stimuli. Caspase cleaves the N-terminal region of iASPP at SSLD294 resulting in a prominent 80kDa fragment of iASPP. This caspase cleavage site is conserved in various species from zebrafish to Homo sapiens. The 80kDa fragment of iASPP translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via the RaDAR nuclear import pathway, independent of p53. The 80kDa iASPP fragment can bind and inhibit p53 or RelA/p65 more efficiently than full-length iASPP. Overall, these data reveal a potential novel regulation of p53 and RelA/p65 activities in response to apoptotic stimuli.",6.359,766

Just as done for hubs, we evaluated the topological and biological properties of inter-complex hubs addressing the following questions. Do inter-complex hubs tend to be evolutionary conserved? What is the relation between crossroad index and essentiality? We found a good correlation between inter-complex hubs and both evolutionary conservation and essentiality.",3.313,26

The results show that human foragers relied primarily on rainforest resources from at least ~20,000 years ago, with a distinct preference for semi-open rainforest and rain forest edges. Homo sapiens' relationship with the tropical rainforests of South Asia is therefore long-standing, a conclusion that indicates the time-depth of anthropogenic reliance and influence on these habitats.",0,1335

In this paper, we present ParaBWT, a parallelized Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and suffix array construction algorithm for big genome data. In ParaBWT, we have investigated a progressive construction approach to constructing the BWT of single genome sequences in linear space complexity, but with a small constant factor. This approach has been further parallelized using multi-threading based on a master-slave coprocessing model. After gaining the BWT, the suffix array is constructed in a memory-efficient manner. The performance of ParaBWT has been evaluated using two sequences generated from two human genome assemblies: the Ensembl Homo sapiens assembly and the human reference genome. Our performance comparison to FMD-index and Bwt-disk reveals that on 12 CPU cores, ParaBWT runs up to 2.2x faster than FMD-index and up to 99.0x faster than Bwt-disk. BWT construction algorithms for very long genomic sequences are time consuming and (due to their incremental nature) inherently difficult to parallelize. Thus, their parallelization is challenging and even relatively small speedups like the ones of our method over FMD-index are of high importance to research.

22558270,Different cranial ontogeny in Europeans and Southern Africans.,"['Sardi ML', 'Ramirez Rozzi FV']",PloS one,2012,"Modern human populations differ in developmental processes and in several phenotypic traits. However, the link between ontogenetic variation and human diversification has not been frequently addressed. Here, we analysed craniofacial ontogenies by means of geometric-morphometrics of Europeans and Southern Africans, according to dental and chronological ages. Results suggest that different adult cranial morphologies between Southern Africans and Europeans arise by a combination of processes that involve traits modified during the prenatal life and others that diverge during early postnatal ontogeny. Main craniofacial changes indicate that Europeans differ from Southern Africans by increasing facial developmental rates and extending the attainment of adult size and shape. Since other studies have suggested that native subsaharan populations attain adulthood earlier than Europeans, it is probable that facial ontogeny is linked with other developmental mechanisms that control the timing of maturation in other variables. Southern Africans appear as retaining young features in adulthood. Facial ontogeny in Europeans produces taller and narrower noses, which seems as an adaptation to colder environments. The lack of these morphological traits in Neanderthals, who lived in cold environments, seems a paradox, but it is probably the consequence of a warm-adapted faces together with precocious maturation. When modern Homo sapiens migrated into Asia and Europe, colder environments might establish pressures that constrained facial growth and development in order to depart from the warm-adapted morphology. Our results provide some answers about how cranial growth and development occur in two human populations and when developmental shifts take place providing a better adaptation to environmental constraints.",3.234,1404

 Series B, Biological sciences",2012,"As only limited insight into behaviour is available from the archaeological record, much of our understanding of historical changes in human cognition is restricted to identifying changes in brain size and architecture. Using both absolute and residual brain size estimates, we show that hominin brain evolution was likely to be the result of a mix of processes; punctuated changes at approximately 100 kya, 1 Mya and 1.8 Mya are supplemented by gradual within-lineage changes in Homo erectus and Homo sapiens sensu lato. While brain size increase in Homo in Africa is a gradual process, migration of hominins into Eurasia is associated with step changes at approximately 400 kya and approximately 100 kya. We then demonstrate that periods of rapid change in hominin brain size are not temporally associated with changes in environmental unpredictability or with long-term palaeoclimate trends. Thus, we argue that commonly used global sea level or Indian Ocean dust palaeoclimate records provide little evidence for either the variability selection or aridity hypotheses explaining changes in hominin brain size. Brain size change at approximately 100 kya is coincident with demographic change and the appearance of fully modern language. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the external pressures driving encephalization, which will only be filled by novel applications of the fossil, palaeoclimatic and archaeological records.",2.147,1123

However, little is known about the influence of tooth morphology on the formation of occlusal wear facets. We analyzed the occlusal wear patterns of first maxillary molars (M(1) s) in Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens, and contemporary modern humans. We applied a virtual method to analyze wear facets on the crown surface of three-dimensional digital models. Absolute and relative wear facet areas are compared with cusp area and cusp height. Although the development of wear facets partially follows the cusp pattern, the results obtained from the between-group comparisons do not reflect the cusp size differences characterizing these groups. In particular, the wear facets developed along the slopes of the most discriminate cusp between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens (hypocone) do not display any significant difference. Moreover, no correlations have been found between cusp size and wear facet areas (with the exception of the modern sample) and between cusp height and wear facet areas. Our results suggest that cusp size is only weakly related to the formation of the occlusal wear facets. Other factors, such as, diet, food processing, environmental abrasiveness, and nondietary habits are probably more important for the development and enlargement of wear facets, corroborating the hypotheses suggested from previous dental wear studies.",1.542,158

Cutting between island landmasses, Wallace's Line separates Sunda and the Eastern Island Arc (the Arc) into distinct tectonic and faunal provinces. West of the line, on Sunda, Java Island yields many fossils of Homo erectus. East of the line, on the Arc, Flores Island provides one skeleton and isolated remains of Homo floresiensis. Luzon Island in the Philippines has another fossil hominin. Sulawesi preserves early hominin archeology. This insular divergence sets up a unique regional context for early hominin dispersal, isolation, and extinction. The evidence is reviewed across three Pleistocene climate periods. Patterns are discussed in relation to the pulse of global sea-level shifts, as well as regional geo-tectonics, catastrophes, stegodon dispersal, and paleogenomics. Several patterns imply evolutionary processes typical of oceanic islands.

Four different sialidase forms are known in vertebrates: the lysosomal NEU1, the cytosolic NEU2 and the membrane-associated NEU3 and NEU4. These enzymes modulate the cell sialic acid content and are involved in several cellular processes and pathological conditions. Molecular defects in NEU1 are responsible for sialidosis, an inherited disease characterized by lysosomal storage disorder and neurodegeneration. The studies on the biology of sialic acids and sialyltransferases, the anabolic counterparts of sialidases, have revealed a complex picture with more than 50 sialic acid variants selectively present in the different branches of the tree of life. The gain/loss of specific sialoconjugates have been proposed as key events in the evolution of deuterostomes and Homo sapiens, as well as in the host-pathogen interactions. To date, less attention has been paid to the evolution of sialidases. Thus we have conducted a survey on the state of the sialidase family in metazoan. Using an in silico approach, we identified and characterized sialidase orthologs from 21 different organisms distributed among the evolutionary tree: Metazoa relative (Monosiga brevicollis), early Deuterostomia, precursor of Chordata and Vertebrata (teleost fishes, amphibians, reptiles, avians and early and recent mammals). We were able to reconstruct the evolution of the sialidase protein family from the ancestral sialidase NEU1 and identify a new form of the enzyme, NEU5, representing an intermediate step in the evolution leading to the modern NEU3, NEU4 and NEU2. Our study provides new insights on the mechanisms that shaped the substrate specificity and other peculiar properties of the modern mammalian sialidases. Moreover, we further confirm findings on the catalytic residues and identified enzyme loop portions that behave as rapidly diverging regions and may be involved in the evolution of specific properties of sialidases.",3.234,1388

We hypothesized that exploiting this feature of miRNAs could improve therapeutic protein production processes by increasing viable cell densities and/or productivity of the mammalian cells used for manufacturing. To identify miRNAs that increase the productivity of producer cells, we performed a genome wide functional miRNA screen by transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing an IgG1 antibody (CHO-IgG1). Using this approach, we identified nine human miRNAs that improved the productivities not only of the CHO-IgG1 cells but also of CHO cells expressing recombinant human serum albumin (HSA), demonstrating that the miRNAs act in a product-independent manner. We selected two miRNAs (miR-557 and miR-1287) positively impacting the viable cell density and the specific productivity, respectively, and then stably co-expressed them in IgG1 expressing CHO cells. In these cells, higher IgG1 titers were observed in fed-batch cultures whilst product quality was conserved, demonstrating that miRNA-based cell line engineering provides an attractive approach toward the genetic optimization of CHO producer cells for industrial applications.",6.767,855

In this study, by applying a strategy of parallel gene expression at a cell-cluster or colony level, we have identified the gene expression pattern of T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TJLs) obtained from two liver cancer patients. METHODS: Here a new method was utilized to analyze the parallel gene expression. By using bioinformatics analysis, the data were also compared with T-cell gene expression present in UniGene. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that 18 genes in specimen A and 13 genes in specimen B were highly expressed after the removal of a nonspecific TIL cDNA library, by pairing gene hybridization; the genes were expressed in CD3+ cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). By using BlastN search, 17 of the 18, and 12 of the 13 sequences were exhibited, respectively, in Homo sapiens, with a range of BlastN E values of 0 to 4 x 10(-13). The LocusLink distribution in chromosomes obtained from both specimens was not significantly different; 17 of 19 putative genes (both specimen A and specimen B) were observed in the UniGene cluster in Homo sapiens, except for dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-3 and diacyglycerol kinase alpha.

It would be interesting to find out if these sequences maintain their conservation at the three-dimensional structure level. They can play an active role in protein and nucleotide stability, thus not only ensuring proper functioning but also potentiating malfunction and disease.

Using a procedure designed to overcome some potential problems with the experiment of Kurylo et al, we found the same distinction in the perceptual processing of Australian sea lions. The sea lions were able to judge the orientation of arrays containing strong proximity and similarity information, but performed at chance levels judging arrays in which element alignment signalled global orientation. Human subjects were able to judge all three pattern types quickly and accurately. This is strong evidence of a qualitative distinction in the way in which perceptual grouping operates in humans and the non-human species tested. Whether this distinction is a consequence of evolutionary or experiential factors is a question for future research, but the mere fact of a qualitative difference holds important implications for our understanding of perceptual grouping.",0.906,436

Subsequently, signal transduction leads to execution of various effector functions which includes aging, immunological, and central nervous system (CNS) regulatory actions. However the conformational pattern of ligand receptor binding is unclear. The three-dimensional structure of the hemokinin-1 in aqueous and micellar environment has been studied by one and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (2D 1H-NMR spectroscopy) and distance geometry calculations. Data shows that hemokinin-1 was unstructured in aqueous environment; anionic detergent SDS induces alpha-helix formation. Proton NMR assignments have been carried out with the aid of correlation spectroscopy (gradient-COSY and TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY and ROESY) experiments. The inter proton distances and dihedral angle constraints obtained from the NMR data have been used in torsion angle dynamics algorithm for NMR applications (CYANA) to generate a family of structures, which have been refined using restrained energy minimization and dynamics. Helical conformation is observed from residue K3-M11. The conformational range of the peptide revealed by NMR studies has been analyzed in terms of characteristic secondary features.

In this study, budgerigars and humans were tested using psychophysical procedures to measure their perception of synchronous, asynchronous, and partially overlapping complex signals, including bird calls and human vowels. Segregation thresholds for complex stimuli were significantly lower than those for pure tone stimuli in both humans and birds. Additionally, a species effect was discovered such that relative to humans, budgerigars required significantly less temporal separation between 2 sounds in order to segregate them. Overall, and similar to previous behavioral results investigating temporal coherence, the results from this experiment illustrate that temporal cues are particularly important for auditory scene analysis across multiple species and for both simple and complex acoustic signals.",1.52,51

However, recent analyses of fossil, archaeological, and environmental data indicate that such traits did not arise as a single package. Instead, some arose substantially earlier and some later than previously thought. From ~2.5 to 1.5 million years ago, three lineages of early Homo evolved in a context of habitat instability and fragmentation on seasonal, intergenerational, and evolutionary time scales.

A total of 69 miRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed in RM. Five of these human (Homo sapiens) miRNAs (hsa-miRNAs), including hsa-miR-3074-5p, -486-3p, -1269b, -6765-3p and -144-3p, were validated by qRT-PCR in 12 RM and 10 NP placental villi.

However, while the human sacrum has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about sacral morphology in nonhuman primates. Thus, it remains unclear whether sacral sexual dimorphism exists in other primates, and whether potential dimorphism is primarily related to obstetrics or other factors such as body size dimorphism. In this study, sacra of Homo sapiens, Hylobates lar, Nasalis larvatus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan troglodytes, and Pan paniscus were evaluated for sexual dimorphism in relative sacral breadth (i.e., the ratio of overall sacral breadth to first sacral vertebral body breadth). Homo sapiens, H. lar, N. larvatus, and G. gorilla exhibit dimorphism in this ratio. Of these, the first three species have large cephalopelvic proportions, whereas G. gorilla has small cephalopelvic proportions. P. pygmaeus, P. troglodytes, and P. paniscus, which all have small cephalopelvic proportions, were not dimorphic for relative sacral breadth. We argue that among species with large cephalopelvic proportions, wide sacral alae in females facilitate birth by increasing the pelvic inlet's transverse diameter. However, given the small cephalopelvic proportions among gorillas, an obstetric basis for dimorphism in relative sacral breadth appears unlikely. This raises the possibility that sacral dimorphism in gorillas is attributable to selection for relatively narrow sacra in males rather than relatively broad sacra in females. Accordingly, these results have implications for interpreting pelvic dimorphism among fossil primates, including hominins.",2.379,776

Linear B-cell epitope mapping was performed to identify polymorphic epitopes when comparing orthologous sequences present in Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent for Chagas disease (CD), and the Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris hosts. The serological assay (ELISA) demonstrated that TL, VL and CVL individuals showed high levels of antibodies against rPeroxidoxin, allowing identification of infected ones with considerable sensitivity and great ability to discriminate (specificity) between non-infected and CD individuals (98.46% and 100%; 98.18% and 95.71%; 95.79% and 100%, respectively). An rPeroxidoxin ELISA also showed a greater ability to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals, which is an important requirement for the public campaign control of CVL. A depletion ELISA assay using soluble peptides of this B-cell epitope confirmed the recognition of these sites only by Leishmania-infected individuals. Moreover, this work identifies two antigenic polymorphic linear B-cell epitopes of L. braziliensis. Specific recognition of TL and VL patients was confirmed by significantly decreased IgG reactivity against rPeroxidoxin after depletion of peptide-1- and peptide-2-specific antibodies (peptide 1: reduced by 32%, 42% and 5% for CL, ML and VL, respectively; peptide-2: reduced by 24%, 22% and 13% for CL, ML and VL, respectively) and only peptide-2 for CVL (reduced 9%). Overall, rPeroxidoxin may be a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of TL, VL or CVL, as it has a higher agreement with parasitological assays and is better than other reference tests that use soluble Leishmania antigens for diagnosing CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC, Bio-manguinhos, FIOCRUZ).",3.234,1012

Here, we investigated P. falciparum-induced modifications of the infected red blood cell (iRBC) membrane proteome, taking into account both host and parasite proteome alterations. Furthermore, we also determined if some protein changes were associated with genotypically distinct P. falciparum strains. Comparison of host membrane proteomes between iRBCs and uninfected red blood cells using fluorescence-based proteomic approaches, such as 2D difference gel electrophoresis revealed that more than 100 protein spots were highly up-represented (fold change increase greater than five) following P. falciparum infection for both strains (i.e. RP8 and Institut Pasteur Pregnancy Associated Malaria). The majority of spots identified by mass spectrometry corresponded to Homo sapiens proteins. However, infection-induced changes in host proteins did not appear to affect molecules located at the outer surface of the plasma membrane. The under-representation of parasite proteins could not be attributed to deficient parasite protein expression.

A recent study on the VNO in the chimpanzee (Smith et al., 2001b) challenged this notion, demonstrating the need for further comparative studies of primates. In particular, there is a need to establish how the human/chimpanzee VNO differs from that of other primates and even nonhomologous mucosal ducts. Histochemical and microscopic morphological characteristics of the VNO and nasopalatine duct (NPD) were examined in 51 peri- and postnatal primates, including humans, chimpanzees, five species of New World monkeys, and seven strepsirhine species. The nasal septum was removed from each primate and histologically processed for coronal sectioning. Selected anteroposterior intervals of the VNO were variously stained with alcian blue (AB)-periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), PAS only, Gomori trichrome, or hematoxylin-eosin procedures. All strepsirhine species had well developed VNOs, with a prominent neuroepithelium and vomeronasal cartilages that nearly surrounded the VNO. New World monkeys had variable amounts of neuroepithelia, whereas Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens had no recognizable neuroepithelium or vomeronasal nerves (VNNs). Certain unidentified cell types of the human/chimpanzee VNO require further examination (immunohistochemical and electron microscopic). The VNOs of P. troglodytes, H. sapiens, and New World monkeys exhibited different histochemistry of mucins compared to strepsirhine species. The nasopalatine region showed great variation among species. It is a blind-ended pit in P. troglodytes, a glandular recess in H. sapiens, a mucous-producing duct in Otolemur crassicaudatus, and a stratified squamous passageway in all other species. This study also revealed remarkable morphological/histochemical variability in the VNO and nasopalatine regions among the primate species examined. The VNOs of humans and chimpanzees had some structural similarities to nonhomologous ciliated gland ducts seen in other primates. However, certain distinctions from the VNOs of other primates or nonhomologous epithelial structures characterize the human/chimpanzee VNO: 1) bilateral epithelial tubes; 2) a superiorly displaced position in the same plane as the paraseptal cartilages; 3) a homogeneous, pseudostratified columnar morphology with ciliated regions; and 4) mucous-producing structures in the epithelium itself.",0,1710

Its activity is related to many diseases; so, it is of importance to study the structure and expression of SOD gene in an animal naturally exposed most of its life to the direct sunlight as a cause of oxidative stress. Arabian camel (one humped camel, Camelus dromedarius) is adapted to the widely varying desert climatic conditions that extremely changes during daily life in the Arabian Gulf. Studying the cSOD1 in C. dromedarius could help understand the impact of exposure to direct sunlight and desert life on the health status of such mammal. The full coding region of a putative CuZnSOD gene of C. dromedarius (cSOD1) was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and cloned for the first time (gene bank accession number for nucleotides and amino acids are JF758876 and AEF32527, respectively). The cDNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 459 nucleotides encoding a protein of 153 amino acids which is equal to the coding region of SOD1 gene and protein from many organisms. The calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point of cSOD1 was 15.7 kDa and 6.2, respectively. The level of expression of cSOD1 in different camel tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, lung and testis) was examined using Real Time-PCR. The highest level of cSOD1 transcript was found in the camel liver (represented as 100%) followed by testis (45%), kidney (13%), lung (11%) and spleen (10%), using 18S ribosomal subunit as endogenous control. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high similarity with Cebus apella (90%), Sus scrofa (88%), Cavia porcellus (88%), Mus musculus (88%), Macaca mulatta (87%), Pan troglodytes (87%), Homo sapiens (87%), Canis familiaris (86%), Bos taurus (86%), Pongo abelii (85%) and Equus caballus (82%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cSOD1 is grouped together with S. scrofa. The predicted 3D structure of cSOD1 showed high similarity with the human and bovine CuZnSOD homologues. The Root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between cSOD1/hSOD1 and cSOD1/bSOD1 superimposed structure pairs were 0.557 and 0.425 A. The Q-score of cSOD1-hSOD1 and cSOD1-bSOD1 were 0.948 and 0.961, respectively.",2.862,1405

The interaction shifts PDK1 into a conformation with increased catalytic activity and leads to autophosphorylation of PDK1. We demonstrate here that addition of a hydrophobic motif peptide increases the catalytic activity of PDK1 orthologues from Homo sapiens, Aplysia californica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ksg1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pkh1 and Pkh2) 2- to 12-fold. Furthermore, the hydrophobic motif peptide increases autophosphorylation of PDK1 from Homo sapiens, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae (Phk2). Our results suggest that PDK1 interaction and activation by the hydrophobic motif of AGC kinases is a central mechanism in PDK1 function, which is conserved during eukaryotic evolution.",2.297,1736

To better understand the mode of binding of the cofactor by this family of enzymes, the structure of Mesorhizobium loti NAT1 [(RHILO)NAT1] was determined in complex with CoA. The F42W mutant of (RHILO)NAT1 was used as it is well expressed in Escherichia coli and displays enzymatic properties similar to those of the wild type. The apo and holo structures of (RHILO)NAT1 F42W were solved at 1.8 and 2 A resolution, respectively. As observed in the Mycobacterium marinum NAT1-CoA complex, in (RHILO)NAT1 CoA binding induces slight structural rearrangements that are mostly confined to certain residues of its `P-loop'. Importantly, it was found that the mode of binding of CoA is highly similar to that of M. marinum NAT1 but different from the modes reported for Bacillus anthracis NAT1 and Homo sapiens NAT2. Therefore, in contrast to previous data, this study shows that different orthologous NATs can bind their cofactors in a similar way, suggesting that the mode of binding CoA in this family of enzymes is less diverse than previously thought. Moreover, it supports the notion that the presence of the `mammalian/eukaryotic insertion loop' in certain NAT enzymes impacts the mode of binding CoA by imposing structural constraints.",2.674,895
8599387,"Basicranial flexion, relative brain size, and facial kyphosis in Homo sapiens and some fossil hominids.","['Ross C', 'Henneberg M']",American journal of physical anthropology,1995,"Comparative work among nonhominid primates has demonstrated that the basicranium becomes more flexed with increasing brain size relative to basicranial length and as the upper and lower face become more ventrally deflected (Ross and Ravosa [1993] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 91:305-324). In order to determine whether modern humans and fossil hominids follow these trends, the cranial base angle (measure of basicranial flexion), angle of facial kyphosis, and angle of orbital axis orientation were measured from computed tomography (CT) scans of fossil hominids (Sts 5, MLD 37/38, OH9, Kabwe) and lateral radiographs of 99 extant humans. Brain size relative to basicranial length was calculated from measures of neurocranial volume and basicranial length taken from original skulls, radiographs, CT scans, and the literature. Results of bivariate correlation analyses revealed that among modern humans basicranial flexion and brain size/basicranial length are not significantly correlated, nor are the angles of orbital axis orientation and facial kyphosis. However, basicranial flexion and orbit orientation are significantly positively correlated among the humans sampled, as are basicranial flexion and the angle of facial kyphosis. Relative to the comparative sample from Ross and Ravosa (1993), all hominids have more flexed basicrania than other primates: Archaic Homo sapiens, Homo erectus, and Australopithecus africanus do not differ significantly from Modern Homo sapiens in their degree of basicranial flexion, although they differ widely in their relative brain size. Comparison of the hominid values with those predicted by the nonhominid reduced major-axis equations reveal that, for their brain size/basicranial length, Archaic and Modern Homo sapiens have less flexed basicrania than predicted. H. erectus and A. africanus have the degree of basicranial flexion predicted by the nonhominid reduced major-axis equation. Modern humans have more ventrally deflected orbits than all other primates and, for their degree of basicranial flexion, have more ventrally deflected orbits than predicted by the regression equations for hominoids. All hominoids have more ventrally deflected orbital axes relative to their palate orientation than other primates. It is argued that hominids do not strictly obey the trend for basicranial flexion to increase with increasing relative brain size because of constraints on the amount of flexion that do not allow it to decrease much below 90 degrees. Therefore, if basicranial flexion is a mechanism for accommodating an expanding brain among non-hominid primates, other mechanisms must be at work among hominids.",2.379,233

This implies the defining of a target sequence long enough to contain interfacial residues. However, too long sequences induce artifactual polymorphism: within tested modeling methods, the longer the target sequence, the more variable the secondary structure, as though the procedure were stopped before the end of the calculation (which may in fact be unreachable). Moreover, delimitation of these TMDs can produce variable results with sequence based two-dimensional prediction methods, especially for sequences showing polymorphism. To solve this problem, we developed a new modeling procedure using the PepLook method. We scanned the sequences by modeling peptides from the target sequence with a window of 19 residues. RESULTS: Using sequences whose NMR-structures are already known (GpA, EphA1 and Erb2-HER2), we first determined that the hydrophobic to hydrophilic accessible surface area ratio (ASAr) was the best criterion for delimiting the TMD sequence. The length of the helical structure and the Impala method further supported the determination of the TMD limits. This method was applied to the IL-2Rbeta and IL-2Rgamma TMD sequences of Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Bos taurus. CONCLUSIONS: We succeeded in reducing the variation in the TMD limits to only 2 residues and in gaining structural information.",1.178,1519
21078182,An improved method for scoring protein-protein interactions using semantic similarity within the gene ontology.,"['Jain S', 'Bader GD']",BMC bioinformatics,2010,"BACKGROUND: Semantic similarity measures are useful to assess the physiological relevance of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). They quantify similarity between proteins based on their function using annotation systems like the Gene Ontology (GO). Proteins that interact in the cell are likely to be in similar locations or involved in similar biological processes compared to proteins that do not interact. Thus the more semantically similar the gene function annotations are among the interacting proteins, more likely the interaction is physiologically relevant. However, most semantic similarity measures used for PPI confidence assessment do not consider the unequal depth of term hierarchies in different classes of cellular location, molecular function, and biological process ontologies of GO and thus may over-or under-estimate similarity. RESULTS: We describe an improved algorithm, Topological Clustering Semantic Similarity (TCSS), to compute semantic similarity between GO terms annotated to proteins in interaction datasets. Our algorithm, considers unequal depth of biological knowledge representation in different branches of the GO graph. The central idea is to divide the GO graph into sub-graphs and score PPIs higher if participating proteins belong to the same sub-graph as compared to if they belong to different sub-graphs. CONCLUSIONS: The TCSS algorithm performs better than other semantic similarity measurement techniques that we evaluated in terms of their performance on distinguishing true from false protein interactions, and correlation with gene expression and protein families. We show an average improvement of 4.6 times the F1 score over Resnik, the next best method, on our Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI dataset and 2 times on our Homo sapiens PPI dataset using cellular component, biological process and molecular function GO annotations.",2.576,1613

CaCYP51 and both HsCYP51 enzymes bound lanosterol (K(s), 14 to 18 muM) and catalyzed the 14alpha-demethylation of lanosterol using Homo sapiens cytochrome P450 reductase and NADPH as redox partners. Both HsCYP51 enzymes bound clotrimazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole tightly (dissociation constants [K(d)s], 42 to 131 nM) but bound fluconazole (K(d), ~30,500 nM) and voriconazole (K(d), ~2,300 nM) weakly, whereas CaCYP51 bound all five medical azole drugs tightly (K(d)s, 10 to 56 nM). Selectivity for CaCYP51 over HsCYP51 ranged from 2-fold (clotrimazole) to 540-fold (fluconazole) among the medical azoles. In contrast, selectivity for CaCYP51 over Delta60HsCYP51 with agricultural azoles ranged from 3-fold (tebuconazole) to 9-fold (propiconazole). Prothioconazole bound extremely weakly to CaCYP51 and Delta60HsCYP51, producing atypical type I UV-visible difference spectra (K(d)s, 6,100 and 910 nM, respectively), indicating that binding was not accomplished through direct coordination with the heme ferric ion. Prothioconazole-desthio (the intracellular derivative of prothioconazole) bound tightly to both CaCYP51 and Delta60HsCYP51 (K(d), ~40 nM). These differences in binding affinities were reflected in the observed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values, which were 9- to 2,000-fold higher for Delta60HsCYP51 than for CaCYP51, with the exception of tebuconazole, which strongly inhibited both CYP51 enzymes.

Transcription of abundant snRNA species is regulated by the snRNA activating protein complex (SNAPc), which is conserved among multicellular organisms including plants. SRD2, a putative subunit of SNAPc in Arabidopsis thaliana, is essential for development, and the point mutation srd2-1 causes severe defects in hypocotyl dedifferentiation and de novo meristem formation. Based on phenotypic analysis of srd2-1 mutant plants, we previously proposed that snRNA content is a limiting factor in dedifferentiation in plant cells. Here, we performed functional complementation analysis of srd2-1 using transgenic srd2-1 Arabidopsis plants harboring SRD2 homologs from Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), Oryza sativa (rice), the moss Physcomitrella patens, and Homo sapiens (human) under the control of the Arabidopsis SRD2 promoter. Only rice SRD2 suppressed the faulty tissue culture responses of srd2-1, and restore the snRNA levels; however, interestingly, all SRD2 homologs except poplar SRD2 rescued the srd2-1 defects in seedling development. These findings demonstrated that cell dedifferentiation and organogenesis induced during tissue culture require higher snRNA levels than does seedling development.",1.823,866

The earliest securely dated modern Homo sapiens in East Asia are currently represented by Zhoukoudian Upper Cave at a minimum of 29 ka BP. In Australia skeletal remains of modern Homo sapiens have been dated to 26 ka BP, with archaeological materials at 38 to 50 ka BP. Late Pleistocene human skeletons from sites like Coobool Creek are morphologically and metrically outside the range of recent Australian Aboriginal populations. Similarly Liujiang and the Upper Cave crania can be distinguished from recent East Asian 'Mongoloids'.

 States of America",2010,"The genealogies of different genetic loci vary in depth. The deeper the genealogy, the greater the chance that it will include a rare event, such as the insertion of a mobile element. Therefore, the genealogy of a region that contains a mobile element is on average older than that of the rest of the genome. In a simple demographic model, the expected time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) is doubled if a rare insertion is present. We test this expectation by examining single nucleotide polymorphisms around polymorphic Alu insertions from two completely sequenced human genomes. The estimated TMRCA for regions containing a polymorphic insertion is two times larger than the genomic average (P < <10(-30)), as predicted. Because genealogies that contain polymorphic mobile elements are old, they are shaped largely by the forces of ancient population history and are insensitive to recent demographic events, such as bottlenecks and expansions. Remarkably, the information in just two human DNA sequences provides substantial information about ancient human population size. By comparing the likelihood of various demographic models, we estimate that the effective population size of human ancestors living before 1.2 million years ago was 18,500, and we can reject all models where the ancient effective population size was larger than 26,000. This result implies an unusually small population for a species spread across the entire Old World, particularly in light of the effective population sizes of chimpanzees (21,000) and gorillas (25,000), which each inhabit only one part of a single continent.",9.674,258

It was found that the expression of the human tRNA(Sec) gene in E.coli can complement a lesion in the tRNA(Sec) gene of this organism. Transcripts of the Homo sapiens and Xenopus laevis tRNA(Sec) genes synthesised in vitro were amino-acylated by the E.coli seryl-tRNA ligase although at a very low rate and the resulting seryl-tRNA(Sec) was bound to and converted into selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec) by the selenocysteine synthase of this organism. Selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec) from both eukaryotes was able to form a complex with translation factor SELB from E.coli.

However, our understanding of how these pressures mediated the behavioral and biological diversity of early modern humans and their migration patterns within and out of Africa is limited by a lack of archaeological evidence associated with detailed paleoenvironmental data. Here, we present the first stable isotopic data from paleosols and fauna associated with Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in East Africa. Late Pleistocene ( approximately 100-45 ka, thousands of years ago) sediments on Rusinga and Mfangano Islands in eastern Lake Victoria (Kenya) preserve a taxonomically diverse, non-analog faunal community associated with MSA artifacts. We analyzed the stable carbon and oxygen isotope composition of paleosol carbonate and organic matter and fossil mammalian tooth enamel, including the first analyses for several extinct bovids such as Rusingoryx atopocranion, Damaliscus hypsodon, and an unnamed impala species. Both paleosol carbonate and organic matter data suggest that local habitats associated with human activities were primarily riverine woodland ecosystems. However, mammalian tooth enamel data indicate that most large-bodied mammals consumed a predominantly C4 diet, suggesting an extensive C4 grassland surrounding these riverine woodlands in the region at the time. These data are consistent with other lines of paleoenvironmental evidence that imply a substantially reduced Lake Victoria at this time, and demonstrate that C4 grasslands were significantly expanded into equatorial Africa compared with their present distribution, which could have facilitated dispersal of human populations and other biotic communities. Our results indicate that early populations of Homo sapiens from the Lake Victoria region exploited locally wooded and well-watered habitats within a larger grassland ecosystem.",3.733,662

We investigated the evolutionary history of Asian tree frogs of the Polypedates leucomystax complex (n = 172) based on 1800 bp of the mtDNA genes ND1 and cytochrome b and tested hypotheses pertaining to climate, geology, and dispersal patterns. Analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and lineage divergence throughout the region with evidence for widespread sympatric lineages and a general north versus south clustering. Relaxed molecular clock analysis and tests for demographic expansion identified an initial cladogenesis during the Miocene with subsequent Plio-Pleistocene diversification, with the former corresponding to periods of increased aridity and the onset of monsoonal weather systems. Rates of diversification were relatively constant until the Early Pleistocene when rates increased exponentially. We found equivocal evidence for isolation-by-distance and a potential role of some landscape features as partial barriers to dispersal. Finally, our analyses showed that divergence between insular and mainland populations occurred before Homo sapiens colonized Southeast Asia, suggesting that historical human-mediated dispersal did not drive insular diversification. Our results suggested that demographic expansion in the Late Pleistocene resulted in widespread sympatric lineages in the P. leucomystax complex throughout southern China and Indochina and further clarified the evolutionary history of lineages within P. leucomystax.",0,1258

Brain research reviews,2000,"The central paradox of schizophrenia is that the condition, apparently genetic in origin, persists in spite of a substantial fecundity disadvantage. The hypothesis is proposed that the predisposition to schizophrenia is a component of Homo sapiens-specific variation associated with the capacity for language. A genetic change (the 'speciation event', predicted to be related to the Xq21.3 to Yp chromosomal transposition that separates Homo sapiens from the great apes) allowed the hemispheres to develop with a 'cerebral torque', reflected particularly in association cortex, from right frontal to left occipital. Variations in the dimension of lateralization are associated with differences in the rate at which verbal and non-verbal ability develops. The nuclear symptoms of schizophrenia can be understood as a failure to establish dominance for a key component - the phonological sequence - of language in one hemisphere, with consequent disruption of the mechanism of 'indexicality' that allows the speaker to distinguish his thoughts from the speech output that he generates and the speech input that he receives and decodes from others.",0,275

The crystals were grown without precipitant in 150 mM KP(i), pH 6.25. The crystals show I4 symmetry typical of the natural occurring tetrameric assembly of the single subunits. The obtained structural model is based on the highest resolution currently achieved for tetramerization domains of voltage-gated potassium channels. We identified an identical fold of the monomer but inside the tetramer the single monomers show a significant rotation which leads to a different orientation of the tetramer compared to other known structures. Such a rotational movement inside the tetrameric assembly might influence the gating properties of the channel. In addition we see two distinct side chain configurations for amino acids located in the top layer proximal to the membrane (Tyr109, Arg116, Ser129, Glu140, Met142, Arg146), and amino acids in the bottom layer of the T1-domain distal from the membrane (Val55, Ile56, Leu77, Arg86). The relative populations of these two states are ranging from 50:50 for Val55, Tyr109, Arg116, Ser129, Glu140, 60:40 for Met142, 65:35 for Arg86, 70:30 for Arg146, and 80:20 for Ile56 and Leu77.

Recently, genome annotations have been used to reconstruct genome scale metabolic reaction networks for numerous species, including Homo sapiens, which allow simulations that provide valuable insights into topics, including predictions of gene essentiality of pathogens, interpretation of genetic polymorphism in metabolic disease syndromes and suggestions for novel approaches to microbial metabolic engineering. These constraint-based simulations are being integrated with the functional genomics portals, an activity that requires efficient implementation of the constraint-based simulations in the web-based environment. RESULTS: Here, we present Acorn, an open source (GNU GPL) grid computing system for constraint-based simulations of genome scale metabolic reaction networks within an interactive web environment. The grid-based architecture allows efficient execution of computationally intensive, iterative protocols such as Flux Variability Analysis, which can be readily scaled up as the numbers of models (and users) increase. The web interface uses AJAX, which facilitates efficient model browsing and other search functions, and intuitive implementation of appropriate simulation conditions. Research groups can install Acorn locally and create user accounts. Users can also import models in the familiar SBML format and link reaction formulas to major functional genomics portals of choice. Selected models and simulation results can be shared between different users and made publically available. Users can construct pathway map layouts and import them into the server using a desktop editor integrated within the system. Pathway maps are then used to visualise numerical results within the web environment. To illustrate these features we have deployed Acorn and created a web server allowing constraint based simulations of the genome scale metabolic reaction networks of E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Acorn is a free software package, which can be installed by research groups to create a web based environment for computer simulations of genome scale metabolic reaction networks. It facilitates shared access to models and creation of publicly available constraint based modelling resources.",2.576,1517

Key questions in the debate on the origin of such behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to Homo sapiens, and whether it has a uniquely African origin. Here we report on a fossil freshwater shell assemblage from the Hauptknochenschicht ('main bone layer') of Trinil (Java, Indonesia), the type locality of Homo erectus discovered by Eugene Dubois in 1891 (refs 2 and 3). In the Dubois collection (in the Naturalis museum, Leiden, The Netherlands) we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins, one unambiguous shell tool, and a shell with a geometric engraving. We dated sediment contained in the shells with (40)Ar/(39)Ar and luminescence dating methods, obtaining a maximum age of 0.54 +/- 0.10 million years and a minimum age of 0.43 +/- 0.05 million years. This implies that the Trinil Hauptknochenschicht is younger than previously estimated. Together, our data indicate that the engraving was made by Homo erectus, and that it is considerably older than the oldest geometric engravings described so far. Although it is at present not possible to assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell, this discovery suggests that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of Asian Homo erectus cognition and neuromotor control.",41.456,172

These phenotypes can be modulated by mutation or polymorphism at numerous genetic loci. Given the remarkable genetic and environmental heterogeneity that characterizes our species, it is understandable that there should be considerable variation in patterns of aging. A genetic approach involving the mapping and positional cloning of major loci could provide basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying such variability. Prototypic examples being investigated by the author and his colleagues are the Werner syndrome and dementias of the Alzheimer type.

But is this possible when looking backward? Using a strict morphological definition, Homo sapiens can probably be traced back in the fossil record to about 150 kyr ago, which fits well with molecular estimates for the ancestor of all living human populations. However, activities reliably indicating established symbolic cognition can be recognized in the archaeological record only back to under 100 kyr ago. Since it is probable that the potential for symbolic cognition was born in the genetic/structural alterations that also gave rise to the distinctive morphological entity Homo sapiens, it appears that the expression of the human symbolic cognitive potential had to await, for many millennia, the >>discovery<< of that potential through a cultural rather than a biological stimulus. Most plausibly, this stimulus was the invention of language. Modern human symbolic cognition is not an extrapolation of pre-existing evolutionary trends, suggesting that Homo sapiens is not biologically >>fine-tuned<< for any specific behavior patterns.",0,1426

To improve current annotations and prevent future propagation of errors, sequence-independent tools are, therefore, needed to assist in the identification of misannotated gene products. In the case of enzymatic functions, each functional assignment implies the existence of a reaction within the organism's metabolic network; a first approximation to a genome-scale metabolic model can be obtained directly from an automated genome annotation. Any obvious problems in the network, such as dead end or disconnected reactions, can, therefore, be strong indications of misannotation. RESULTS: We demonstrate that a machine-learning approach using only network topological features can successfully predict the validity of enzyme annotations. The predictions are tested at three different levels. A random forest using topological features of the metabolic network and trained on curated sets of correct and incorrect enzyme assignments was found to have an accuracy of up to 86% in 5-fold cross-validation experiments. Further cross-validation against unseen enzyme superfamilies indicates that this classifier can successfully extrapolate beyond the classes of enzyme present in the training data. The random forest model was applied to several automated genome annotations, achieving an accuracy of ~60% in most cases when validated against recent genome-scale metabolic models. We also observe that when applied to draft metabolic networks for multiple species, a clear negative correlation is observed between predicted annotation quality and phylogenetic distance to the major model organism for biochemistry (Escherichia coli for prokaryotes and Homo sapiens for eukaryotes).

Fourteen T. guasayana were collected from six georeferenced trap locations in the Andean highlands of the department of Chuquisaca, Bolivia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We detected four blood meals sources with the cloning assay: seven samples were positive for human (Homo sapiens), five for chicken (Gallus gallus) and unicolored blackbird (Agelasticus cyanopus), and one for opossum (Monodelphis domestica). Using the qPCR assay we detected chicken (13 vectors), and human (14 vectors) blood meals as well as an additional blood meal source, Canis sp. (4 vectors). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show that cloning of 12S PCR products, which avoids bias associated with developing primers based on a priori knowledge, detected blood meal sources not previously considered and that species-specific qPCR is more sensitive. All samples identified as positive for a specific blood meal source by the cloning assay were also positive by qPCR. However, not all samples positive by qPCR were positive by cloning.

Neanderthal and European Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens crania were included in the analysis as well. The results of this study indicated that there is a significant relationship between the degree of occipital plane convexity and the following two features in the examined crania of modern humans: the ratio of the maximum neurocranial height to the maximum width of the vault and the ratio of bregma-lambda chord to bregma-lambda arc. The results also revealed that some H. sapiens crania (modern and fossil) show the Neanderthal shape of the occipital plane and that the neurocranial height and shape of parietal midsagittal profile has an influence on occipital plane convexity in the hominins included in this study.

 Series B, Biological sciences",2016,"If we restrict the use of Homo sapiens in the fossil record to specimens which share a significant number of derived features in the skeleton with extant H. sapiens, the origin of our species would be placed in the African late middle Pleistocene, based on fossils such as Omo Kibish 1, Herto 1 and 2, and the Levantine material from Skhul and Qafzeh. However, genetic data suggest that we and our sister species Homo neanderthalensis shared a last common ancestor in the middle Pleistocene approximately 400-700 ka, which is at least 200 000 years earlier than the species origin indicated from the fossils already mentioned. Thus, it is likely that the African fossil record will document early members of the sapiens lineage showing only some of the derived features of late members of the lineage. On that basis, I argue that human fossils such as those from Jebel Irhoud, Florisbad, Eliye Springs and Omo Kibish 2 do represent early members of the species, but variation across the African later middle Pleistocene/early Middle Stone Age fossils shows that there was not a simple linear progression towards later sapiens morphology, and there was chronological overlap between different 'archaic' and 'modern' morphs. Even in the late Pleistocene within and outside Africa, we find H. sapiens specimens which are clearly outside the range of Holocene members of the species, showing the complexity of recent human evolution. The impact on species recognition of late Pleistocene gene flow between the lineages of modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans is also discussed, and finally, I reconsider the nature of the middle Pleistocene ancestor of these lineages, based on recent morphological and genetic data.This article is part of the themed issue 'Major transitions in human evolution'.",2.147,2

VT-1161 produced a type II binding spectrum with Candida albicans CYP51, characteristic of heme iron coordination. The binding affinity of VT-1161 for Candida albicans CYP51 was high (dissociation constant [Kd], </= 39 nM) and similar to that of the pharmaceutical azole antifungals (Kd, </= 50 nM). In stark contrast, VT-1161 at concentrations up to 86 muM did not perturb the spectrum of recombinant human CYP51, whereas all the pharmaceutical azoles bound to human CYP51. In reconstitution assays, VT-1161 inhibited Candida albicans CYP51 activity in a tight-binding fashion with a potency similar to that of the pharmaceutical azoles but failed to inhibit the human enzyme at the highest concentration tested (50 muM). In addition, VT-1161 (MIC = 0.002 mug ml(-1)) had a more pronounced fungal sterol disruption profile (increased levels of methylated sterols and decreased levels of ergosterol) than the known CYP51 inhibitor voriconazole (MIC = 0.004 mug ml(-1)). Furthermore, VT-1161 weakly inhibited human CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, suggesting a low drug-drug interaction potential. In summary, VT-1161 potently inhibited Candida albicans CYP51 and culture growth but did not inhibit human CYP51, demonstrating a >2,000-fold selectivity. This degree of potency and selectivity strongly supports the potential utility of VT-1161 in the treatment of Candida infections.",4.476,861

Due to their combination of plesiomorphic, unique and derived traits, they were ascribed to a new species, Homo floresiensis, which, along with Stegodon, appears to have become extinct  approximately 17 ka (thousand years ago). However, recently it has been argued that several characteristics of H. floresiensis were consistent with dwarfism and evidence of delayed development in modern human (Homo sapiens) myxoedematous endemic (ME) cretins. This research compares the skeletal and dental morphology in H. floresiensis with the clinical and osteological indicators of cretinism, and the traits that have been argued to be associated with ME cretinism in LB1 and LB6. Contrary to published claims, morphological and statistical comparisons did not identify the distinctive skeletal and dental indicators of cretinism in LB1 or LB6 H. floresiensis. Brain mass, skeletal proportions, epiphyseal union, orofacial morphology, dental development, size of the pituitary fossa and development of the paranasal sinuses, vault bone thickness and dimensions of the hands and feet all distinguish H. floresiensis from modern humans with ME cretinism. The research team responsible for the diagnosis of ME cretinism had not examined the original H. floresiensis skeletal materials, and perhaps, as a result, their research confused taphonomic damage with evidence of disease, and thus contained critical errors of fact and interpretation. Behavioural scenarios attempting to explain the presence of cretinous H. sapiens in the Liang Bua Pleistocene deposits, but not unaffected H. sapiens, are both unnecessary and not supported by the available archaeological and geochronological evidence from Flores.",3.733,117

RNA recognition is achieved by a KH domain with an additional alpha-helix (QUA2) that seems to extend the RNA-binding surface to six nucleotides for SF1 (Homo sapiens) and seven nucleotides for GLD-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans). To understand the structural basis of this probable difference in specificity, we determined the solution structure of GLD-1 KH-QUA2 with the complete consensus sequence identified in the tra-2 gene. Compared to SF1, the GLD-1 KH-QUA2 interface adopts a different conformation resulting indeed in an additional sequence-specific binding pocket for a uracil at the 5'end. The functional relevance of this binding pocket is emphasized by our bioinformatics analysis showing that GLD-1 binding sites with this 5'end uracil are more predictive for the functional response of the messenger RNAs to gld-1 knockout. We further reveal the importance of the KH-QUA2 interface in vitro and that its alteration in vivo affects the level of translational repression dependent on the sequence of the GLD-1 binding motif. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the QUA2 domain distinguishes GLD-1 from other members of the STAR family and contributes more generally to the modulation of RNA-binding affinity and specificity of KH domain containing proteins.",9.112,985

So, with a novel outlook, this study explores the molecular level demonstration of the best satisfactory MDM2 model selection after performing manifold modeling techniques. Z-scores and other stereochemical features were estimated for comparison. Further, protein-protein docking was executed with MDM2 and the experimentally validated X-ray crystallographic DHFR. Residual disclosure from the best suited simulated protein complex disclosed 18 side chain and 3 ionic interactions to strongly accommodate MDM2 protein into the pocket-like zone in DHFR due to the positive environment by charged residues. Lysine residues from MDM2 played a predominant role. Moreover, evaluation from varied energy calculations, folding rate, and net area for solvent accessibility implied the active participation of MDM2 with DHFR. Fascinatingly, conformational transitions from coils to helices and beta-sheets after interaction with DHFR affirm the conformational strength and firmer interaction of human MDM2-DHFR.

In mouse and chick, experimental misexpression, including upstream and downstream genes, results in shifts in vertebral identity, loss of particular parts of individual vertebrae or vertebral fusion. Axial skeleton homologies across the Vertebrata allow these observations to be extended to taxa such as Homo sapiens, Chondrichthyes and Placodermi, the latter an entirely fossil group. Misexpression phenotypes among fossil taxa illuminate the phylogenetic history of these regulatory mechanisms. Phenotypes associated with genes originating via genomic duplication can determine the historical depth for these duplication events. Analysis of an ontogenetic sequence for the occipital-synarcual complex in the placoderm Cowralepis mclachlani provides the basis for comparison of this early gnathostome with other placoderms, chondrichthyans and amniotes. The occipital-synarcual patterns in placoderms parallel the phenotypic misexpression in mice and chicks (fusion and homeotic mutation) and the varying degrees of fusion in the Type I-III human Klippel-Feil syndrome. The association of these phenotypes to Hoxd regulatory complexes indicates that the gnathostome genomic duplication occurred at the base of the gnathostome stem group. Given the conservative nature of regulatory genes and the homology of vertebral elements, the presence of fusion in stem gnathostomes implies that the mechanism of fusion in mouse and chick models can be extrapolated to extant chondrichthyans (testable) and accounts for the phenotypic similarity across gnathostomes. The presence of these phenotypes in fossils indicates the antiquity of these regulatory mechanisms and of genomic duplication.",0,1869

Comparison of the sequences of those gamma chains from Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca nemestrina and P. cynocephalus that have been well characterized attests to the conservative nature of gamma-chain evolution among the Anthropoidea, the differences in sequence between any two of these chains ranging from none (between the A gamma and G gamma chains of P. troglodytes and H. sapiens) to no more than five (between the V gamma chains of P. cynocephalus and the A gamma chains of H. sapiens).",0.787,1873

Only in the human genome, the activity of a minority of replication origins seems to generate compositional biases. In this work, we provide evidence for replication-associated GC and TA skews in the genomes of two yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis, whereas the data for the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome are less conclusive. In contrast with the genomes of Homo sapiens and of the majority of eubacteria, the leading strand is enriched in cytosine and adenine in both S. cerevisiae and K. lactis. We observed significant variations across the interorigin intervals of several substitution rates in the S. cerevisiae lineage since its divergence from S. paradoxus. We also found that the S. cerevisiae genome is far from compositional equilibrium and that its present compositional biases are due to substitution rates operating before its divergence from S. paradoxus. Finally, we observed that replication and transcription tend to be cooriented in the S. cerevisiae genome, especially for genes encoding subunits of protein complexes. Taken together, our results suggest that replication-related compositional biases may be a feature of many eukaryotic genomes despite the stochastic nature of the firing of replication origins in these genomes.",9.105,1350

Since proteins do not work in isolation, understanding biological systems requires a better understanding of the interconnectivity between proteins in different pathways and processes, which includes both physical and other functional interactions. Such biological networks can be generated within organisms or between organisms sharing a common environment using experimental data and computational predictions. Though different data sources provide different levels of accuracy, confidence in interactions can be measured using interaction scores. Connections between interacting proteins in biological networks can be represented as graphs and edges, and thus studied using existing algorithms and tools from graph theory. There are many different applications of biological networks, and here we discuss three such applications, specifically applied to the infectious disease tuberculosis, with its causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis and host, Homo sapiens.

RESULTS: However, as the resolution of these techniques is limited we used multicolor banding (MCB) at an ~250-band level, and other selected human DNA probes to establish a detailed chromosomal map of TCR. Therefore it was possible to precisely determine evolutionary conserved breakpoints, orientation of segments and distribution of specific regions in TCR compared to HSA. Overall, 69 evolutionary conserved breakpoints including chromosomal segments, which failed to be resolved in previous reports, were exactly identified and characterized. CONCLUSIONS: This work also represents the first molecular cytogenetic one characterizing a multiple sex chromosome system with a male karyotype 44,XY1Y2. The obtained results are compared to other available data for old world monkeys and drawbacks in hominoid evolution are discussed.",2.14,1096

JCV is an arthropod-borne, zoonotic virus with deer as the primary amplifying host in western alpine ecosystems. We collected mosquitoes from natural resting areas, fiber pots, and carbon-dioxide baited miniature light traps in the Colorado Rocky Mountains in 2007. We conducted two polymerase chain reactions to amplify and sequence vertebrate DNA extracted from blood-fed mosquitoes, which yielded comparable, but not identical, results. Mammal-specific primers found mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) as the source of all bloodmeals. To determine if unamplified bloodmeals were from nonmammalian sources, we screened all samples with conserved vertebrate primers, which confirmed the initial polymerase chain reaction results, but also found porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and human (Homo sapiens) as additional bloodmeal sources. We consistently found that mule deer were the primary hosts for mosquitoes in this system. These results suggest that snow-melt mosquitoes, in particular A. cataphylla, may be important vectors in western JCV alpine systems and may also act as a bridge vector for JCV from cervid virus reservoirs to humans.",1.953,1791

Although many efforts have been devoted to detecting protein interactions by high-throughput experiments, these methods are obviously expensive and tedious. Targeting these inevitable disadvantages, this study develops a novel computational method to predict PPIs using information on protein sequences, which is highly efficient and accurate. The improvement mainly comes from the use of the Rotation Forest (RF) classifier and the Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptor from the Physicochemical Property Response (PR) Matrix of protein amino acids. When performed on three PPI datasets including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, and Helicobacter pylori, we obtained good results of average accuracies of 93.8%, 97.96%, and 89.47%, which are much better than in previous studies. Extensive validations have also been explored to evaluate the performance of the Rotation Forest ensemble classifier with the state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine classifier.

New localities from the Kapedo Tuffs augment the sparse sample of MSA sites from the northern Kenya Rift. Tephrostratigraphic correlation with dated pyroclastic deposits from the adjacent volcano Silali suggests an age range of 135-123ka for archaeological sites of the Kapedo Tuffs. Comparisons of the Kapedo Tuffs archaeological assemblages with those from the adjacent Turkana and Baringo basins show broad lithic technological similarity but reveal that stone raw material availability is a key factor in explaining typologically defined archaeological variability within this region. Spatially and temporally resolved comparisons such as this provide the best means to link the biological and behavioral variation manifest in the record of early Homo sapiens.,3.733,1729

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified a broad spectrum of differentially expressed pancreatic cancer-related genes. Of these, we selected an overexpressed expressed sequence taq and cloned a 721-bp full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 196 amino acids. This novel gene was localized on the Homo sapiens 16p13.3 chromosomal locus, and its nucleotide sequence matched the Homo sapiens similar to common salivary protein 1 (LOC124220). We named the gene pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor. The pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor was secreted into the culture medium of pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 25 kDa, and was N-glycosylated. The induction of pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor in Chinese hamster ovary cells increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability in vitro. Subcutaneous injection of mice with Chinese hamster ovary/pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor cells resulted in 3.8-fold greater tumor sizes compared to Chinese hamster ovary/mock cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting with antirecombinant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor antibodies confirmed that pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor was highly expressed in six of eight pancreatic cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of human pancreatic cancer tissues also showed pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor overexpression in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Transfection with pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor-specific small-interfering RNA reduced cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Treatment with antirecombinant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor in vitro and in vivo reduced proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenic ability. Collectively, our results suggest that pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor is a novel secretory protein involved in pancreatic cancer progression and might be a potential target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",3.523,1727

We applied a transfer of search paradigm between rectangular- and kite-shaped arenas to examine the performance of human adults (using virtual environments) and children of 2.5-3.5 years (using real arenas). Adults showed robust transfer to a congruent corner in a kite-shaped arena, following training in a rectangular-shaped arena in two paradigms modeled on those used with rats and young children respectively. In contrast, the children showed no evidence of transfer of search, despite above chance performance in the rectangular arena, and above chance performance in a study where search occurred in the kite arena only. The pattern of findings suggests global aspects of environmental geometry may be used to re-establish heading, and that the matching of elements of local geometry in new global contexts may be an advanced developmental achievement.",3.307,85

Loss of function mutations in humans or experimental deletion in mice result in iron overload consistent with a putative ferroxidase function. Prior work suggested plasma may contain multiple ferroxidases. Studies were conducted in Holtzman rats (Rattusnorvegicus), albino mice (Mus musculus), Cp-/- mice, and adult humans (Homo sapiens) to investigate the copper-iron interaction. Dietary copper-deficient (CuD) rats and mice were produced using a modified AIN-76A diet. Results confirmed that o-dianisidine is a better substrate than paraphenylene diamine (PPD) for assessing diamine oxidase activity of Cp. Plasma from CuD rat dams and pups, and CuD and Cp-/- mice contained no detectable Cp diamine oxidase activity. Importantly, no ferroxidase activity was detectable for CuD rats, mice, or Cp-/- mice compared to robust activity for copper-adequate (CuA) rodent controls using western membrane assay. Immunoblot protocols detected major reductions (60-90%) in Cp protein in plasma of CuD rodents but no alteration in liver mRNA levels by qRT-PCR.

Miyagawa et al. (2013) put forward a proposal, which we will call the Integration Hypothesis of human language evolution, that holds that human language is composed of two components, E for expressive, and L for lexical. Each component has an antecedent in nature: E as found, for example, in birdsong, and L in, for example, the alarm calls of monkeys. E and L integrated uniquely in humans to give rise to language. A challenge to the Integration Hypothesis is that while these non-human systems are finite-state in nature, human language is known to require characterization by a non-finite state grammar. Our claim is that E and L, taken separately, are in fact finite-state; when a grammatical process crosses the boundary between E and L, it gives rise to the non-finite state character of human language. We provide empirical evidence for the Integration Hypothesis by showing that certain processes found in contemporary languages that have been characterized as non-finite state in nature can in fact be shown to be finite-state. We also speculate on how human language actually arose in evolution through the lens of the Integration Hypothesis.",2.56,1052

CaSR has been described as having an extended sequence containing a Ca(2+) binding pocket within an extracellular amino (N)-terminal domain, called a Venus Fly Trap (VFT) module. CaSR is thought to consist of three domains: 1) a Ca(2+-)sensory domain, 2) a region containing 7 transmembrane (TM) helices, and 3) a carboxy (C)-terminal tail. We find that SPOCTOPUS (a combination of hidden Markov models and artificial neural networks) predicts that Homo sapiens CaSR contains two additional TM helices ((190)D - G(210); (262)S-E(282)), with the second TM helix containing a pore-lining region ((265)K - I(280)).

It has been argued that the complexity of life has steadily increased since that event. Here we challenge this hypothesis through the characterization of apoptosis in reef-building corals, representatives of some of the earliest animals. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that all of the major components of the death receptor pathway are present in coral with high-predicted structural conservation with Homo sapiens. The TNF receptor-ligand superfamilies (TNFRSF/TNFSF) are central mediators of the death receptor pathway, and the predicted proteome of Acropora digitifera contains more putative coral TNFRSF members than any organism described thus far, including humans. This high abundance of TNFRSF members, as well as the predicted structural conservation of other death receptor signaling proteins, led us to wonder what would happen if corals were exposed to a member of the human TNFSF (HuTNFalpha). HuTNFalpha was found to bind directly to coral cells, increase caspase activity, cause apoptotic blebbing and cell death, and finally induce coral bleaching. Next, immortalized human T cells (Jurkats) expressing a functional death receptor pathway (WT) and a corresponding Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) KO cell line were exposed to a coral TNFSF member (AdTNF1) identified and purified here. AdTNF1 treatment resulted in significantly higher cell death (P < 0.0001) in WT Jurkats compared with the corresponding FADD KO, demonstrating that coral AdTNF1 activates the H. sapiens death receptor pathway. Taken together, these data show remarkable conservation of the TNF-induced apoptotic response representing 550 My of functional conservation.",9.674,802

We determined the function of RBP2 and its regulation in HCC in vitro and in human tissues. METHODS: We analyzed gene expression in 20 specimens each of human HCC and normal liver tissue by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Proliferation was analyzed by foci formation and senescence by beta-galactosidase staining. Promoter activity was detected by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: The expression of RBP2 was stronger in cancerous than non-cancerous tissues, but that of its binding microRNA, Homo sapiens miR-212 (hsa-miR-212), showed an opposite pattern. SiRNA knockdown of RBP2 significantly upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), with suppression of HCC cell proliferation and induction of senescence. Overexpression of hsa-miR-212 suppressed RBP2 expression, with inhibited cell proliferation and induced cellular senescence, which coincided with upregulated CDKIs; with low hsa-miR-212 expression, CDKIs were downregulated in HCC tissue.

Because of its prevalence, chemotherapy for gastric cancer treatment represents an active area of pharmacology research, and different small compounds have been used as single treatments or in combination therapy. Unfortunately, chemoresistance is a common phenomenon in gastric cancer cells, and the current arsenal of small compounds used in chemotherapy is not effective for long periods of treatment. Thus, to understand how gastric cancer cells develop chemoresistance and also to find new protein targets and small compounds for gastric cancer treatment, a systems pharmacology-based study was performed using the proteomic and small compounds-protein interaction data available for Homo sapiens. A major physical protein-protein and chemo-protein interaction (PPPI-PCPI) network was obtained, and five subnetworks representing different biological processes were observed. Interestingly, the small compounds currently used to treat gastric cancer converge on the same biological processes, potentially resulting in the development of chemoresistance. This analysis was followed by a network centrality study, which allows for selection of protein targets and/or small compounds, termed bottlenecks, that are defined as central nodes. The bottlenecks control the flow of biological information within the network, and their disruption can break the entire network into small components. From ten major bottlenecks observed within the network, seven bottlenecks represent new protein targets that are suitable for the development of new combinatory drug regimens for gastric cancer treatment.",3.522,1472

The full-length cDNA consisted of 1762 bp, with a 1104-bp open reading frame encoding 367 amino acids.

In the human skeletal muscles, MAb Titl 5 H1.1 reacts specifically with titin in the A-band of the sarcomere and in different non-muscle cell types with nucleus and cytoplasm, including centrioles. In this report we have studied the evolutionary aspects of the binding of MAb Tit1 5 H1.1 with its target antigen (titin). RESULTS: We have specified the epitope area of MAb Tit1 5 H1.1 by subpeptide mapping to the hexapeptide N-AVNKYG-C. According to protein databases this amino acid sequence is located in the COOH-terminus of several different Fn3 domains of the A-region of titin molecule in many organisms, such as human being, mouse, rabbit, zebrafish (Danio rerio), and even in sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis). Our immunohisto- and cytochemical studies with MAb Tit1 5 H1.1 in human, mouse and zebrafish tissues and cell cultures showed a striated staining pattern in muscle cells and also staining of centrioles, cytoplasm and nuclei in non-muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm that titin can play, in addition to the known roles in striated muscle cells also an important role in non-muscle cells as a centriole associated protein. This phenomenon is highly conserved in the evolution and is related to Fn3 domains of the titin molecule.

Revue therapeutique,2004,"In biology, atavism is generally understood as a biological phenomenon which brings to sight a recurrent phenotypic character which was lost for extinct generations. Phylogenic evolution of homo sapiens demonstrates today that the first plantar ray in tetrapods has always been a very stable ray and the lateral foot experienced a progressive adduction to the talo-metatarsal axis, together with a remodeling of the lateral column of the foot and a progressive valgus of the calcaneus beneath the talus. The foot appears as a strongly modified extremity, starting at a prehensile foot organ, common to our ancestors. In homo sapiens, the hand became a very mobile, less loaded organ, while the foot became a rather less mobile, but more loaded organ. The first ray, distal to Lisfranc's ligament, has no ligamentous structure holding it to the second ray. Stability is thus precarious and controlled by extrinsic and intrinsic muscles. Passive mobility of the tarso-metatarsal joints has been studied in vitro and in vivo. A relationship between unstable or hypermobile first ray and relevant Hallux valgus deformity has been demonstrated. Factors which facilitate the deformity are a long hallux and a functional equinus of the foot. Clinical pathology includes metatarsalgia, hammer toes, together with metatarsus primus varus and shortened gastrocnemii. Logical treatment of relevant and painful deformity includes tarso-metatarsal fusion with or without fusion to the second metatarsus. Osteotomies seem less secure in severe cases on the long run. In conclusion, Hallux valgus cannot be considered as an atavism because clinical history and findings do not correspond to the archaic prehensile foot and its evolution, but rather do correspond to a weak spot on a (still) fragile, often overloaded, phylogenetically young organ.",0,1756

Pcdh11X is present throughout the mammalian radiation; however, 6 million years ago (MYA), a reduplicative translocation of the Xq21.3 block onto what is now human Yp11 created the Homo sapiens-specific PCDH11Y. Therefore, modern human females express PCDH11X whereas males express both PCDH11X and PCDH11Y. PCDH11X/Y has been subject to accelerated evolution resulting in human-specific changes to both proteins, most notably 2 cysteine substitutions in the PCDH11X ectodomain that may alter binding characteristics. The PCDH11X/Y gene pair is postulated to be critical to aspects of human brain evolution related to the neural correlates of language. Therefore, we raised antibodies to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of PCDH11X/Y in cortical and sub-cortical areas of the human fetal brain between 12 and 34 postconceptional weeks.

Bacteria metabolize melamine via three consecutive deamination reactions to generate cyanuric acid. The second deamination reaction, in which ammeline is the substrate, is common to many bacteria, but the genes and enzymes responsible have not been previously identified. Here, we combined bioinformatics and experimental data to identify guanine deaminase as the enzyme responsible for this biotransformation. The ammeline degradation phenotype was demonstrated in wild-type Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas strains, including E. coli K12 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Bioinformatics analysis of these and other genomes led to the hypothesis that the ammeline deaminating enzyme was guanine deaminase. An E. coli guanine deaminase deletion mutant was deficient in ammeline deaminase activity, supporting the role of guanine deaminase in this reaction. Two guanine deaminases from disparate sources (Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 and Homo sapiens) that had available X-ray structures were purified to homogeneity and shown to catalyze ammeline deamination at rates sufficient to support bacterial growth on ammeline as a sole nitrogen source. In silico models of guanine deaminase active sites showed that ammeline could bind to guanine deaminase in a similar orientation to guanine, with a favorable docking score.

This change in facial profile is associated with a characteristic spatial distribution of bone deposition and resorption: growth remodeling. For humans, surface resorption commonly dominates on anteriorly-facing areas of the subnasal region of the maxilla and mandible during development. We mapped the distribution of facial growth remodeling activities on the 900-800 ky maxilla ATD6-69 assigned to H. antecessor, and on the 1.5 My cranium KNM-WT 15000, part of an associated skeleton assigned to African H. erectus. We show that, as in H. sapiens, H. antecessor shows bone resorption over most of the subnasal region. This pattern contrasts with that seen in KNM-WT 15000 where evidence of bone deposition, not resorption, was identified. KNM-WT 15000 is similar to Australopithecus and the extant African apes in this localized area of bone deposition. These new data point to diversity of patterns of facial growth in fossil Homo. The similarities in facial growth in H. antecessor and H. sapiens suggest that one key developmental change responsible for the characteristic facial morphology of modern humans can be traced back at least to H. antecessor.",3.234,1465

Our data show that increasing concentrations of both particulate and soluble Cr(VI) induce increasing amounts of cytotoxicity and clastogenicity in human and sperm whale skin cells. Furthermore, the data show that sperm whale cells are resistant to these effects exhibiting less cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the human cells. Differences in Cr uptake accounted for some but not all of the differences in particulate and soluble Cr(VI) genotoxicity, although it did explain the differences in particulate Cr(VI) cytotoxicity.

Scanning models claim that the list is scanned from the ends of the list inward until a match is found. Positional discrimination models claim that positional uncertainty accounts for accuracy and reaction time patterns. In Experiment 1, we trained rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and humans (Homo sapiens) on adjacent pairs (e.g., AB, BC, CD, DE, EF) and tested them with previously untrained nonadjacent pairs (e.g., BD). In Experiment 2, we trained a second list and tested with nonadjacent pairs selected between lists (e.g., B from List 1, D from List 2). We then introduced associative competition between adjacent items in Experiment 3 by training 2 items per position (e.g., B(1)C(1), B(2)C(2)) before testing with untrained nonadjacent items. In all 3 experiments, humans and monkeys showed distance effects in which accuracy increased, and reaction time decreased, as the distance between items in each pair increased (e.g., BD vs. BE). In Experiment 4, we trained adjacent pairs with separate 9- and 5-item lists. We then tested with nonadjacent pairs selected between lists to determine whether list items were chosen according to their absolute position (e.g., D, 5-item list > E, 9-item list), or their relative position (e.g., D, 5-item list < E, 9-item list).

Recently hLdhc was reported to express in a broad spectrum of tumors with relatively high frequency in lung cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer, and in some prostate cancers. Two melanoma cell lines that express the hLdhc gene, A375M and C81-61, were identified and were used to characterize the hLdhc promoter and explore transcriptional regulation of this gene. A 110-bp core promoter, including a conserved GC box and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element (CRE), were identified as essential for basal promoter activity. The methylation status of the CpG island (CGI) in the hLdhc core promoter sequence was analyzed in hLdhc-expressing and nonexpressing cells and human prostate tumor tissues. The CGI in 2 cell lines expressing the gene was hypomethylated whereas the DNA from cells that did not express hLdhc was hypermethylated. The role of methylation in regulating this promoter was confirmed by experimental induction of hLdhc transcription with the methylation inhibitor 5'aza-deoxycytidine. Quantitative analyses of the methylation level in the CGI were performed in prostate tumor tissues by pyrosequencing. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that hLdhc expression in cancer cells was regulated by transcription factor Sp1 and CREB and promoter CGI methylation. In addition, these findings suggest the possibility of developing a biomarker for cancer diagnosis/prognosis based on DNA methylation of the Ldhc gene.",2.473,473

RESULTS: We identified three major clades among bonobos that separated approximately 540,000 years ago, as suggested by Bayesian analysis. Incidentally, we discovered that the current reference sequence for bonobo likely is a hybrid of the mitochondrial genomes of two distant individuals. When comparing spectra of polymorphic mtDNA sites in bonobos and humans, we observed two major differences: (i) Of all 31 bonobo mtDNA homoplasies, i.e. nucleotide changes that occurred independently on separate branches of the phylogenetic tree, 13 were not homoplasic in humans. This indicates that at least a part of the unstable sites of the mitochondrial genome is species-specific and difficult to be explained on the basis of a mutational hotspot concept. (ii) A comparison of the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (dN/dS) among polymorphic positions in bonobos and in 4902 Homo sapiens mitochondrial genomes revealed a remarkable difference in the strength of purifying selection in the mitochondrial genes of the F0F1-ATPase complex. While in bonobos this complex showed a similar low value as complexes I and IV, human haplogroups displayed 2.2 to 7.6 times increased dN/dS ratios when compared to bonobos. CONCLUSIONS: Some variants of mitochondrially encoded subunits of the ATPase complex in humans very likely decrease the efficiency of energy conversion leading to production of extra heat. Thus, we hypothesize that the species-specific release of evolutionary constraints for the mitochondrial genes of the proton-translocating ATPase is a consequence of altered heat homeostasis in modern humans.",3.368,1420

Fascin is an actin-binding protein that is present predominantly in filopodia, which are believed to play a central role in normal and aberrant cell migration. An important outstanding question regards the molecular basis for the unique localization and functional properties of fascin compared with other actin crosslinking proteins. Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length Homo sapiens fascin-1, and examine its packing, conformational flexibility, and evolutionary sequence conservation. The structure reveals a novel arrangement of four tandem beta-trefoil domains that form a bi-lobed structure with approximate pseudo 2-fold symmetry. Each lobe has internal approximate pseudo 2-fold and pseudo 3-fold symmetry axes that are approximately perpendicular, with beta-hairpin triplets located symmetrically on opposite sides of each lobe that mutational data suggest are actin-binding domains. Sequence conservation analysis confirms the importance of hydrophobic core residues that stabilize the beta-trefoil fold, as well as interfacial residues that are likely to stabilize the overall fascin molecule. Sequence conservation also indicates highly conserved surface patches near the putative actin-binding domains of fascin, which conformational dynamics analysis suggests to be coupled via an allosteric mechanism that might have important functional implications for F-actin crosslinking by fascin.",4.333,202

One key issue is the diversity observed in metabolic profiles of different healthy individuals, commonly attributed to the variation of intrinsic (such as (epi)genetic variation, gut microbiota, etc.) and extrinsic factors (such as dietary habits, life-style and environmental conditions). Understanding the relative contributions of these factors is essential to establish the robustness of the healthy individual metabolic phenotype. METHODS: To assess the relative contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic factors we compared multilevel analysis results obtained from subjects of Homo sapiens and Macaca mulatta, the latter kept in a controlled environment with a standardized diet by making use of previously published data and results. RESULTS: We observed similarities for the two species and found the diversity of urinary metabolic phenotypes as identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could be ascribed to the complex interplay of intrinsic factors and, to a lesser extent, of extrinsic factors in particular minimizing the role played by diet in shaping the metabolic phenotype. Moreover, we show that despite the standardization of diet as the most relevant extrinsic factor, a clear individual and discriminative metabolic fingerprint also exists for monkeys. We investigate the metabolic phenotype both at the static (i.e., at the level of the average metabolite concentration) and at the dynamic level (i.e., concerning their variation over time), and we show that these two components sum up to the overall phenotype with different relative contributions of about 1/4 and 3/4, respectively, for both species. Finally, we show that the great degree diversity observed in the urinary metabolic phenotype of both species can be attributed to differences in both the static and dynamic part of their phenotype.",3.234,998
6443184,The initial peopling of the Americas: an overview from the perspective of physical anthropology.,[],Acta anthropogenetica,1984,"A central problem of human evolution is whether the transition from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens was anagenetic or cladogenetic. The existence of H. erectus at Zhoukoudian between 460,000 and 230,000 years B.P. is consistent with early cladogenesis or a later transition. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA suggests present day humans could have evolved from a population existing between 180,000 and 360,000 years ago. Genetic distance studies based on nuclear genes suggest divergence between Negroids and Mongoloid-Caucasoids 115,000 years ago and between Caucasoids and Mongoloids 41,000 years ago. Recent fossil evidence is consistent with these estimates. Other evidence is accumulating that Asia is the heartland for the emergence of Homo sapiens. The earliest clearly defined North American culture (Clovis) was established at most by 14,000 years B.P. and on some views had spread to Tierra del Fuego by 11,000 B.P. Other evidence from geographically diverse areas suggests an earlier arrival. The initial human occupation of the Americas probably occurred somewhere between 12,000 and 40,000 years ago. However, much of the work on dating skeletal material has yielded inconsistent or unreliable information. Paleoecology indicates that at the maximum lowering of sea-level, 18,000 years ago, the Beringia land bridge was 1000 Km wide and was an inhospitable region of wind-blown dunes and discontinuous vegetation. However, there may have been patches of greater productivity. One theory suggests humans were widely distributed in Beringia as early as 35,000 B.P. and had penetrated Alaska and Yukon by 25,000 B.P. Again, however, the archaeological evidence for early occupation is conflicting and uncertain. Evidence based on analysis of gene frequencies and on dental data suggests North American origins by 19,000 and 15,000 respectively. Further, both the genetic and dental evidence favour an Asian origin, but whether the result of a single or multiple migrations is still an open question. The view here is that the erectus-sapiens transition took place somewhere in South Asia between 125,000 to 200,000 years ago, with the appearance of anatomically modern man by 30-40,000 B.P. Sometime between 30,000-15,000 B.P. the first people crossed Beringia to North America, spreading to occupy all of the Americas rapidly. The ancestors of the Na-Dene Indians and the Aleut-Eskimos were later and perhaps separate arrivals from Asia between 14,000-8,500 B.P. The Eskimo ancestors arose finally by a fissioning of the Aleutian Island-Southwest Alaskan maritime population about 4,000 years ago.",0,1618

The adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which colonize the ileal mucosa of patients with CD, adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells. We investigated the mechanism by which AIEC infection alters the expression of microRNAs and the host immune response. METHODS: Levels of microRNAs in human intestinal epithelial T84 cells and in mouse enterocytes were measured using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Luciferase assays were used to measure binding of microRNAs to the 3'-untranslated region of messenger RNA targets. Binding of nuclear factor-kappaB to promoters of genes encoding microRNAs was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Autophagy was measured by immunoblot analyses and immunofluorescent labeling of LC3. Anti-microRNAs were transferred to mice using ileal loops. Biopsy specimens from the terminal ileum of patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 20), CD (n = 20), or individuals without inflammatory bowel disease undergoing surveillance colonoscopies (controls, n = 13) were collected during endoscopic examination. RESULTS: AIEC infection up-regulated levels of microRNA (MIR) 30C and MIR130A in T84 cells and in mouse enterocytes by activating nuclear factor-kappaB. Up-regulation of these microRNAs reduced the levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1 and inhibited autophagy, leading to increased numbers of intracellular AIEC and an increased inflammatory response. In ileal biopsy samples of patients with CD, there was an inverse correlation between levels of MIR30C and MIR130A and those of ATG5 and ATG16L1, supporting in vitro findings. Inhibition of MIR30C and MIR130A in cultured intestinal epithelial cells and in mouse enterocytes blocked AIEC-induced inhibition of ATG5 and ATG16L1 expression and restored functional autophagy. This resulted in more effective clearance of intracellular AIEC and reduced AIEC-induced inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with AIEC up-regulates microRNAs to reduce expression of proteins required for autophagy and autophagy response in intestinal epithelial cells. Ileal samples from patients with CD have increased levels of these same microRNAs and reduced levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1.",16.716,788

Here, we studied the geographic distribution of K113 and K115 among 156 HIV-1+ subjects from the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians. In the individuals studied, we found higher insertion frequencies of K113 (21%) and K115 (35%) in African Americans compared with Caucasians (K113 9% and K115 6%) within the United States. We also report the presence of three single nucleotide polymorphism sites in the K113 5' long terminal repeats (LTRs) and four in the K115 5' LTR that together constituted four haplotypes for K113 and five haplotypes for K115. HERV insertion times can be estimated from the sequence differences between the 5' and 3' LTR of each insertion, but this dating method cannot be used with HERV-K115. We developed a method to estimate insertion times by applying coalescent inference to 5' LTR sequences within our study population and validated this approach using an independent estimate derived from the genetic distance between K113 5' and 3' LTR sequences.

As a result, modern humans display striking differences from the living apes in the realm of cognition and linguistic expression. In this article, we review the evolutionary changes that occurred in the descent of Homo sapiens by reconstructing the neural and cognitive traits that would have characterized the last common ancestor and comparing these with the modern human condition. The last common ancestor can be reconstructed to have had a brain of approximately 300-400 g that displayed several unique phylogenetic specializations of development, anatomical organization, and biochemical function. These neuroanatomical substrates contributed to the enhancement of behavioral flexibility and social cognition. With this evolutionary history as precursor, the modern human mind may be conceived as a mosaic of traits inherited from a common ancestry with our close relatives, along with the addition of evolutionary specializations within particular domains. These modern human-specific cognitive and linguistic adaptations appear to be correlated with enlargement of the neocortex and related structures. Accompanying this general neocortical expansion, certain higher-order unimodal and multimodal cortical areas have grown disproportionately relative to primary cortical areas. Anatomical and molecular changes have also been identified that might relate to the greater metabolic demand and enhanced synaptic plasticity of modern human brain's. Finally, the unique brain growth trajectory of modern humans has made a significant contribution to our species' cognitive and linguistic abilities.",2.097,1708

All of the substituted kynurenines examined have substrate activity with both human as well as P. fluorescens kynureninase. For the human enzyme, 3- and 5-substituted kynurenines have kcat and kcat/Km values higher than L-kynurenine, but less than that of the physiological substrate, 3-hydroxykynurenine. However, 3,5-dibromo- and 5-bromo-3-chlorokynurenine have kcat and kcat/Km values close to that of 3-hydroxykynurenine with human kynureninase. The effects of the 3-halo substituents on the reactivity with human kynureninase may be due to electronic effects and/or halogen bonding. In contrast, for the bacterial enzyme, 3-methyl, 3-halo and 3,5-dihalokynurenines are much poorer substrates, while 3-fluoro, 5-bromo, and 5-chlorokynurenine have kcat and kcat/Km values comparable to that of its physiological substrate, L-kynurenine. Thus, 5-bromo and 5-chloro-L-kynurenine are good substrates for both human as well as bacterial enzyme, indicating that both enzymes have space for substituents in the active site near C-5. The increased activity of the 5-halokynurenines may be due to van der Waals contacts or hydrophobic effects.

25909184,Co-regulation of translation in protein complexes.,"['Siwiak M', 'Zielenkiewicz P']",Biology direct,2015,"BACKGROUND: Co-regulation of gene expression has been known for many years, and studied widely both globally and for individual genes. Nevertheless, most analyses concerned transcriptional control, which in case of physically interacting proteins and protein complex subunits may be of secondary importance. This research is the first quantitative analysis that provides global-scale evidence for translation co-regulation among associated proteins. RESULTS: By analyzing the results of our previous quantitative model of translation, we have demonstrated that protein production rates plus several other translational parameters, such as mRNA and protein abundance, or number of produced proteins from a gene, are well concerted between stable complex subunits and party hubs. This may be energetically favorable during synthesis of complex building blocks and ensure their accurate production in time. In contrast, for connections with regulatory particles and date hubs translational co-regulation is less visible, indicating that in these cases maintenance of accurate levels of interacting particles is not necessarily beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Similar results obtained for distantly related model organisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens, suggest that the phenomenon of translational co-regulation applies to the variety of living organisms and concerns many complex constituents. This phenomenon was also observed among the set of functionally linked proteins from Escherichia coli operons. This leads to the conclusion that translational regulation of a protein should always be studied with respect to the expression of its primary interacting partners.",4.658,794

The G-quadruplex formation is thought to be a molecular switch for gene expression. Genome-wide analyses of G-quadruplexes have been published for many species; however, only one genome-wide analysis of G-quadruplexes in plants has been reported. Here, we propose a new approach involving a two-step procedure for identifying G-quadruplex-forming sequences (potential G4 DNA motif regions: G4MRs) and classifying positional relationships between G4MRs and genes. By using this approach, we exhaustively searched for G4MRs in the whole genomes of 8 species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa subsp. japonica, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Homo sapiens, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. We classified genes on the basis of their positional relationships to their proximal G4MRs. We identified novel rules for G4MRs in plants, such as G4MR-enrichment in the template strands at transcription start sites (TSSs). Next, we focused on the template strands of TSSs and conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes proximal to G4MRs. We identified GO terms such as chloroplast and nucleosome (or histone) in O. sativa. Although these terms were strongly associated in O. sativa, weak associations were identified in other plants. These results will be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of G4 DNA.",1.884,1232

It catalyses the formation of nicotinic acid mononucleotide from quinolinic acid, which involves a phosphoribosyl transfer reaction followed by decarboxylation. hQPRTase has been implicated in a number of neurological conditions and in order to study it further, we have carried out structural and kinetic studies on recombinant hQPRTase. The structure of the fully active enzyme overexpressed in Escherichia coli was solved using multiwavelength methods to a resolution of 2.0 A. hQPRTase has a alpha/beta barrel fold sharing a similar overall structure with the bacterial QPRTases. The active site of hQPRTase is located at an alpha/beta open sandwich structure that serves as a cup for the alpha/beta barrel of the adjacent subunit with a QA binding site consisting of three arginine residues (R102, R138 and R161) and two lysine residues (K139 and K171). Mutation of these residues affected substrate binding or abolished the enzymatic activity. The kinetics of the human enzyme are different to the bacterial enzymes studied, hQPRTase is inhibited competitively and non-competitively by one of its substrates, 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP). The human enzyme adopts a hexameric arrangement, which places the active sites in close proximity to each other.",4.333,477
26442197,C. elegans sirtuin SIR-2.4 and its mammalian homolog SIRT6 in stress response.,['Jedrusik-Bode M'],Worm,2014,"Stress is a significant life event. The immediate response to stress is critical for survival. In organisms ranging from the unicellular Saccharomyces cerevisiae to protozoa (Trypanosoma brucei) and metazoan (such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens) stress response leads to the formation of cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes referred to as stress granules (SGs). SGs regulate cell survival during stress by the sequestration of the signaling molecules implicated in apoptosis. They are a transient place of messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) remodeling for storage, degradation, or reinitiation of translation during stress and recovery from stress. Recently, we have identified chromatin factor, the sirtuin C. elegans SIR-2.4 variant and its mammalian homolog SIRT6 as a regulator of SGs formation. SIRT6 is highly conserved NAD(+)-dependent lysine deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase impacting longevity, metabolism, and cancer. We observed that the cellular formation of SGs by SIRT6 or SIR-2.4 was linked with the cell viability or C. elegans survival and was dependent on SIRT6 enzymatic activity. Here, we discuss how SIR-2.4/SIRT6 influences SGs formation and stress response. We suggest possible mechanisms for such an unanticipated function of a chromatin regulatory factor SIRT6 in assembly of stress granules and cellular stress resistance.",0,1080

The full-length cDNA of 2098 bp consists an open reading frame of 1596 nucleotides that translates into a 532-amino acid putative protein, with a 5' untranslated region of 323 bp and 3' UTR of 153 bp. The MjSCRBQ is constitutively expressed in gills, heart, hemolymph, hepatopancreas, intestine, lymphoid organ, muscle, nerve, and stomach and at high levels in the brain. Expression analysis in lymphoid organs of shrimp infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) revealed high levels of MjSCRBQ 72 and 120 h post-infection. The MjSCRBQ contains putative functional domains including transmembrane domains and a CD36 domain. Multiple alignments of MjSCRBQ amino acid sequences showed significant identity with Drosophila melanogaster SCRBQ (31%), Salmo salar SCRBQ (29%), Homo sapiens SCRBQ (28%) and Rattus norvegicus SCRBQ (30%).

To date, manual curation still produces the highest quality models. However, manual curation is too slow and costly to be completed even for the most important organisms. In recent years, machine-learned ensemble gene predictors have become a viable alternative to manual curation. Current approaches make use of signal and genomic region consistency among sources and some voting scheme to resolve conflicts in the evidence. As a further step in that direction, we have developed eCRAIG (ensemble CRAIG), an automated curation tool that combines multiple sources of evidence using global discriminative training. This allows efficient integration of different types of genomic evidence with complex statistical dependencies to maximize directly annotation accuracy. Our method goes beyond previous work in integrating novel non-linear annotation agreement features, as well as combinations of intrinsic features of the target sequence and extrinsic annotation features. RESULTS: We achieved significant improvements over the best ensemble predictors available for Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. In particular, eCRAIG achieved a relative mean improvement of 5.1% over Jigsaw, the best published ensemble predictor in all our experiments.

Both experiments produced similar results: The pigeon and human data were well described by the generalized form of Weber's law (Getty, 1975). Experiment 3 demonstrated that the birds did not use perceived brightness to mediate the discrimination of brief visual durations. Experiment 4 used a modified staircase procedure that yielded a continuous measure of discrimination from absolute threshold (0 s) to about 1 s.

A more recent set of Uranium series dates indicate that the Maba travertine may date to >237 ka (thousands of years ago), as opposed to the original U-series date, which placed Maba at 135-129 ka. The fossils under study include five upper first and second molars and a partial left mandible with a socketed m3, all recovered from different parts of the site than the cranium or the dated sediments. The results of our metric and 2D geometric morphometric ('GM') study suggest that the upper first molars are likely from modern humans, suggesting a more recent origin. The upper second molars align more closely with modern humans, though the minimum spanning tree from the 2D GM analysis also connects Maba to Homo neanderthalensis. The patterning in the M2s is not as clear as with the M1s. The m3 and partial mandible are morphometrically intermediate between Holocene modern humans and older Homo sapiens. However, a minimum spanning tree indicates that both the partial mandible and m3 align most closely with Holocene modern humans, and they also may be substantially younger than the cranium. Because questions exist regarding the context and the relationship of the dated travertine with the hominin fossils, we suggest caution is warranted in interpreting the Maba specimens.",3.733,248

It is generally considered that the larger the sample size, the better the gene network inference performance. Nevertheless, there is not adequate information on determining the sample size for optimal performance. In this study, the author systematically demonstrates the effect of sample size on information-theory-based gene network inference algorithms with an ensemble approach. The empirical results showed that the inference performances of the considered algorithms tend to converge after a particular sample size region. As a specific example, the sample size region around  approximately 64 is sufficient to obtain the most of the inference performance with respect to precision using the representative algorithm C3NET on the synthetic steady-state data sets of Escherichia coli and also time-series data set of a homo sapiens subnetworks. The author verified the convergence result on a large, real data set of E. coli as well. The results give evidence to biologists to better design experiments to infer gene networks. Further, the effect of cutoff on inference performances over various sample sizes is considered. [Includes supplementary material].",1.059,1412

Specimens used in the analysis included Neandertals and Upper Palaeolithic early modern Homo sapiens from Europe and individuals from two recent modern human populations. Ontogenetic data for the H. erectus adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and for Gorilla gorilla were included for comparison. Previous reports have indicated that H. erectus demonstrates a pattern of ontogeny characterized by earlier and more rapid linear growth than in modern humans. Results reported here demonstrate that Upper Paleolithic early modern Homo sapiens display a growth trajectory indistinguishable from that of recent modern humans. The pattern of Neandertal ontogeny is not intermediate between the pattern displayed in H. erectus and the derived pattern seen in the modern reference samples and the early modern H. sapiens sample. The Neandertal growth trajectory is consistent with either slow linear growth or advanced dental development.,3.733,1477

Here, the first human liver-specific metabolic network was reconstructed according to proteomics data from Chinese Human Liver Proteome Project (CNHLPP), and then investigated in the context of the genome-scale metabolic network of Homo sapiens. Topological analysis shows that this organ-specific metabolic network exhibits similar features as organism-specific networks, such as power-law degree distribution, small-world property, and bow-tie structure. Furthermore, the structure of liver network exhibits a modular organization where the modules are formed around precursors from primary metabolism or hub metabolites from derivative metabolism, respectively. Most of the modules are dominated by one major category of metabolisms, while enzymes within same modules have a tendency of being expressed concertedly at protein level. Network decomposition and comparison suggest that the liver network overlays a predominant area in the global metabolic network of H. sapiens genome; meanwhile the human network may develop extra modules to gain more specialized functionality out of liver. The results of this study would permit a high-level interpretation of the metabolite information flow in human liver and provide a basis for modeling the physiological and pathological metabolic states of liver.",4.245,1671

RESULTS: Overall, 68 new evolutionary conserved breakpoints compared to HSA could be characterized in this study. Interestingly, only seven of those were different compared to HLA. However, application of heterochromatic human DNA-probes provided evidence that observed high chromosomal rearrangement rates of gibbons in HPI happened rather in these repetitive elements than in euchromatin, even though most centromeric positions were preserved in HPI compared to HSA. CONCLUSION: Understanding genomes of other species and comparing them to HSA needs full karyotypic and high resolution genomic data to approach both: euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of the studied chromosome-content.

This DNA-repair function also plays a key role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and in the resistance of bacterial cells to antibiotics. A hexameric form of a truncated Methanococcus voltae RadA protein devoid of its small N-terminal domain has been crystallized. The RadA hexamers further assemble into two-ringed assemblies. Similar assemblies can be observed in the crystals of Pyrococcus furiosus RadA and Homo sapiens DMC1.

Three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of endobasicranial shape reveal previously undocumented details of evolutionary changes in Homo sapiens. Larger olfactory bulbs, relatively wider orbitofrontal cortex, relatively increased and forward projecting temporal lobe poles appear unique to modern humans.

Well-dated and well-preserved fossils older than  approximately 45,000 years that can be unequivocally attributed to Homo sapiens are lacking. Here we present evidence from the newly excavated Fuyan Cave in Daoxian (southern China). This site has provided 47 human teeth dated to more than 80,000 years old, and with an inferred maximum age of 120,000 years. The morphological and metric assessment of this sample supports its unequivocal assignment to H. sapiens. The Daoxian sample is more derived than any other anatomically modern humans, resembling middle-to-late Late Pleistocene specimens and even contemporary humans. Our study shows that fully modern morphologies were present in southern China 30,000-70,000 years earlier than in the Levant and Europe. Our data fill a chronological and geographical gap that is relevant for understanding when H. sapiens first appeared in southern Asia. The Daoxian teeth also support the hypothesis that during the same period, southern China was inhabited by more derived populations than central and northern China. This evidence is important for the study of dispersal routes of modern humans. Finally, our results are relevant to exploring the reasons for the relatively late entry of H. sapiens into Europe. Some studies have investigated how the competition with H. sapiens may have caused Neanderthals' extinction (see ref. 8 and references therein). Notably, although fully modern humans were already present in southern China at least as early as  approximately 80,000 years ago, there is no evidence that they entered Europe before  approximately 45,000 years ago.

To address this lack of information, the development of cerebral tissues was tracked in growing chimpanzees during infancy and the juvenile stage, using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and compared with that of humans and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Overall, cerebral development in chimpanzees demonstrated less maturity and a more protracted course during prepuberty, as observed in humans but not in macaques. However, the rapid increase in cerebral total volume and proportional dynamic change in the cerebral tissue in humans during early infancy, when white matter volume increases dramatically, did not occur in chimpanzees. A dynamic reorganization of cerebral tissues of the brain during early infancy, driven mainly by enhancement of neuronal connectivity, is likely to have emerged in the human lineage after the split between humans and chimpanzees and to have promoted the increase in brain volume in humans. Our findings may lead to powerful insights into the ontogenetic mechanism underlying human brain enlargement.",0,1167

However, Y genes are rarely characterized outside a few model species due to the arduous nature of studying the repeat-rich Y. RESULTS: The chromosome quotient (CQ) is a novel approach to systematically discover Y chromosome genes. In the CQ method, genomic DNA from males and females is sequenced independently and aligned to candidate reference sequences. The female to male ratio of the number of alignments to a reference sequence, a parameter called the chromosome quotient (CQ), is used to determine whether the sequence is Y-linked. Using the CQ method, we successfully identified known Y sequences from Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. The CQ method facilitated the discovery of Y chromosome sequences from the malaria mosquitoes Anopheles stephensi and An. gambiae. Comparisons to transcriptome sequence data with blastn led to the discovery of six Anopheles Y genes, three from each species. All six genes are expressed in the early embryo. Two of the three An. stephensi Y genes were recently acquired from the autosomes or the X. Although An. stephensi and An. gambiae belong to the same subgenus, we found no evidence of Y genes shared between the species. CONCLUSIONS: The CQ method can reliably identify Y chromosome sequences using the ratio of alignments from male and female sequence data. The CQ method is widely applicable to species with fragmented genome assemblies produced from next-generation sequencing data. Analysis of the six Y genes characterized in this study indicates rapid Y chromosome evolution between An. stephensi and An. gambiae.

Until this announcement, the dominant paradigm stipulated that: 1) only more derived hominins had emerged from Africa, and 2) H. sapiens was the only hominin since the demise of Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis. Resistance to H. floresiensis has been intense, and debate centers on two sets of competing hypotheses: 1) that it is a primitive hominin, and 2) that it is a modern human, either a pygmoid form or a pathological individual. Despite a range of analytical techniques having been applied to the question, no resolution has been reached. Here, we use cladistic analysis, a tool that has not, until now, been applied to the problem, to establish the phylogenetic position of the species. Our results produce two equally parsimonious phylogenetic trees. The first suggests that H. floresiensis is an early hominin that emerged after Homo rudolfensis (1.86Ma) but before H. habilis (1.66Ma, or after 1.9Ma if the earlier chronology for H. habilis is retained).

Novel transcript prediction analysis identified 6321 new transcripts with lengths ranging from 180 to 14884 bp, and 2267 of them were predicted to code proteins. BLAST analysis of the new transcripts showed that 1200?4933 mapped to the non-redundant (nr), nucleotide (nt) and/or SwissProt sequence databases. Comparative statistical analysis of the new mapped transcripts showed that the majority of them were similar to genes in Bos taurus (41.4%), Bos grunniens mutus (33.0%), Ovis aries (6.3%), Homo sapiens (2.8%), Mus musculus (1.6%) and other species. Functional analysis showed that these expressed genes were involved in various Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. GO analysis of the new transcripts found that the largest proportion of them was associated with reproduction. The results of this study will provide a basis for describing the normal transcriptome map of yak ovary and for future studies on yak breeding performance. Moreover, the results confirmed that RNA-Seq HT technology is highly advantageous in improving gene structure information and mining of new genes, as well as in providing valuable data to expand the yak genome information.",1.688,958
1543241,Reduction of maxillary molars in Homo sapiens sapiens: a different perspective.,"['Macho GA', 'Moggi-Cecchi J']",American journal of physical anthropology,1992,"Crown and cusp areas, and buccolingual and mesiodistal diameters of maxillary molars of complete upper tooth rows (30 males, 30 females) were analysed in order to quantify changes in size and shape from the first to the third molar. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed the mesial cusps, in particular the protocone (mesiolingual cusp), to be more stable than the other cusps. Although there is a gradient in size from the first to third molar, shape changes were found to be marked. Overall, the findings are in keeping with the field theory and the hypotheses of environmental constraints on later developing teeth. However, not all of the results could be entirely explained by these concepts. Functional aspects seem to account for the relative stability of the protocone and the buccolingual crown diameter. It appears that this functional complex is relatively stable despite the overall reduction of tooth size, which is probably secondary to processes occurring in the jaws and the cranium. This finding may have implications for studies on tooth reduction between populations of different time periods.",2.379,414

This paper proposes a novel methodology based on information theoretic metrics for finding regulatory sequences in promoter regions. RESULTS: This methodology (SIGMA) has been tested on genomic sequence data for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SIGMA has been compared with different publicly available alternatives for motif detection, such as MEME/MAST, Biostrings (Bioconductor package), MotifRegressor, and previous work such Qresiduals projections or information theoretic based detectors. Comparative results, in the form of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, show how, in 70% of the studied Transcription Factor Binding Sites, the SIGMA detector has a better performance and behaves more robustly than the methods compared, while having a similar computational time. The performance of SIGMA can be explained by its parametric simplicity in the modelling of the non-linear co-variability in the binding motif positions. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence Information Gain based Motif Analysis is a generalisation of a non-linear model of the cis-regulatory sequences detection based on Information Theory. This generalisation allows us to detect transcription factor binding sites with maximum performance disregarding the covariability observed in the positions of the training set of sequences.

This editing is a widespread post-transcriptional modification event in animals. In this study, we identified the full-length cDNA sequence of Ctenopharyngodon idella ADAR1 (designated as CiADAR1) and detected the mRNA expression patterns in response to dsRNA (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt, poly(I:C)) and grass carp reovirus (GCRV). CiADAR1 is a large gene in size, consisting of 4833 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1392 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains seven putative domains: one proline-rich region (Pro-R), two Z-DNA-binding domains (Zalpha), three dsRNA binding motifs (DSRM) and one tRNA-specific and dsRNA adenosine deaminase domain (ADEAMc). It is most homologous to Danio rerio ADAR (E-value = 0.0, identities = 80% (1110/1395)), also close homology to Homo sapiens ADAR1 (E-value = 0.0, identities = (47%) 530/1122). CiADAR1 mRNA was investigated in fifteen tissues, and was low expressed in muscle and head kidney tissues, high in blood and spleen tissues by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). mRNA expressions of CiADAR1 were significantly up-regulated and reached peak at 24 h post GCRV challenge in vivo and in vitro (P < 0.05). After poly(I:C) stimulation at different concentrations, CiADAR1 transcripts were rapidly and significantly up-regulated and recovered in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners (P < 0.05). The results indicate CiADAR1 was implicated in the antiviral immune response and laid the foundation for further studies on functions and mechanisms of RNA editing in fishes.",2.674,1292

In plants, each of the NF-YA/B/C subunit forms a multi-member family. NF-Ys are key regulators with important roles in many physiological processes, such as drought tolerance, flowering time, and seed development. In this study, we identified, annotated, and further characterized 14 NF-YA, 14 NF-YB, and 5 NF-YC proteins in Brassica napus (canola). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NF-YA/B/C subunits were more closely clustered with the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) homologs than with rice OsHAP2/3/5 subunits. Analyses of the conserved domain indicated that the BnNF-YA/B/C subfamilies, respectively, shared the same conserved domains with those in other organisms, including Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis, and Oryza sativa (rice). An examination of exon/intron structures revealed that most gene structures of BnNF-Y were similar to their homologs in Arabidopsis, a model dicot plant, but different from those in the model monocot plant rice, suggesting that plant NF-Ys diverged before monocot and dicot plants differentiated. Spatial-tempo expression patterns, as determined by qRT-PCR, showed that most BnNF-Ys were widely expressed in different tissues throughout the canola life cycle and that several closely related BnNF-Y subunits had similar expression profiles. Based on these findings, we predict that BnNF-Y proteins have functions that are conserved in the homologous proteins in other plants. This study provides the first extensive evaluation of the BnNF-Y family, and provides a useful foundation for dissecting the functions of BnNF-Y.",3.263,1082

Animal behavior processes,2010,"Smith and Minda (1998) and Blair and Homa (2001) studied the time course of category learning in humans. They distinguished an early, abstraction-based stage of category learning from a later stage that incorporated a capacity for categorizing exceptional category members. The present authors asked whether similar processing stages characterize the category learning of nonhuman primates. Humans (Homo sapiens) and monkeys (Macaca mulatta) participated in category-learning tasks that extended Blair and Homa's paradigm comparatively. Early in learning, both species improved on typical items more than on exception items, indicating an initial mastery of the categories' general structure. Later in learning, both species selectively improved their exception-item performance, indicating exception-item resolution or exemplar memorization. An initial stage of abstraction-based category learning may characterize categorization across a substantial range of the order Primates.

 biologisch-anthropologische Literatur",2015,"The taxonomic attribution of the 1.55 million year old young adult fossil calvaria KNM-ER 42700   from Ileret, Kenya, is subject to ongoing controversy. It has been attributed to H. erectus based on comparative description and linear measurements. However, 3-D geometric morphometric analysis found that this specimen fell outside the range of variation of H. erectus in its cranial shape, which was intermediate between H. erectus and modern humans. One problem is that analyses so far were conducted on the original specimen, which shows slight post-mortem distortion. Here we use a surface scan of a high resolution cast of KNM-ER 42700 to virtually reconstruct the calvaria and conduct a new 3D geometric morphometric analysis of both its original and its reconstructed shape. Our comparative sample included several specimens of H. erectus (s.l., including the subadult KNM-WT 15000), H. habilis, H. heidelbergenis (s.l.) and H. neanderthalensis, as well as early and Upper Paleolithic H. sapiens. Our principal component analysis results showed that, like the original specimen, our virtual reconstruction of KNM-ER 42700 is also intermediate in shape between fossil Homo and modern humans. Taphonomic distortion, therefore, appears to not have been a major factor affecting previous 3-D geometric morphometric analyses. The intermediate shape of KNM-ER 42700 might instead be related to the young developmental age of the specimen. Further work on reconstructing the original specimen or based on computed tomorgraphic scans is needed to confirm these results.",0.222,1421

This study uses computer simulations of gait in models derived from the best-known skeletons of these species (AL 288-1, Australopithecus afarensis, 3.18 million year ago) and KNM-WT 15000 (Homo ergaster, 1.5-1.8 million year ago) compared to models of adult human males and females, to estimate the required muscle power during bipedal walking, and to compare this with those in modern humans. Skeletal measurements were carried out on a cast of KNM-WT 15000, but for AL 288-1 were taken from the literature. Muscle attachments were applied to the models based on their position relative to the bone in modern humans. Joint motions and moments from experiments on human walking were input into the models to calculate muscle stress and power. The models were tested in erect walking and 'bent-hip bent-knee' gait. Calculated muscle forces were verified against EMG activity phases from experimental data, with reference to reasonable activation/force delays. Calculated muscle powers are reasonably comparable to experimentally derived metabolic values from the literature, given likely values for muscle efficiency. The results show that: 1) if evaluated by the power expenditure per unit of mass (W/kg) in walking, AL 288-1 and KNM-WT 15000 would need similar power to modern humans; however, 2) with distance-specific parameters as the criteria, AL 288-1 would require to expend relatively more muscle power (W/kg.m(-1)) in comparison to modern humans. The results imply that in the evolution of bipedalism, body proportions, for example those of KNM-WT 15000, may have evolved to obtain an effective application of muscle power to bipedal walking over a long distance, or at high speed.",3.733,1252

METHODS: Patients with BCC (n = 7) were included in this study. Punch biopsies were harvested from the tumour centre (lesional, n = 7) and from adjacent nonlesional skin (intraindividual control, n = 7). Microarray-based miRNA expression profiles were obtained on an Agilent platform using miRBase 16 screening for 1205 Homo sapiens (hsa)-miRNA candidates.

The Solitaire illusion is a numerosity illusion in humans that occurs when one misperceives the relative number of 2 types of items presented in intermingled sets. To date, no study has investigated whether nonhuman animals perceive the Solitaire illusion as humans do. Here, we compared the perception of the Solitaire illusion in human and nonhuman primates in 3 experiments. We first observed (Experiment 1) the spontaneous behavior of chimpanzees when presented with 2 arrays composed of a different number of preferred and nonpreferred food items. In probe trials, preferred items were presented in the Solitaire pattern in 2 different spatial arrangements (either clustered centrally or distributed on the perimeter). Chimpanzees did not show any misperception of quantity in the Solitaire pattern. Next, humans, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and capuchin monkeys underwent the same testing of relative quantity judgments in a computerized task that also presented the Solitaire illusion (Experiments 2 and 3). Unlike humans, chimpanzees did not appear to perceive the illusion, in agreement with Experiment 1. The performance of rhesus monkeys and capuchin monkeys was also different from that of humans, but was slightly more indicative of a potential Solitaire illusion.

Nucleophiles, such as oximes, are used as antidotes as they can reactivate and restore the function of the inhibited enzyme. The oxime HI-6 shows a notably low activity on tabun adducts but can effectively reactivate adducts of cyclosarin and Russian VX. To examine the structural basis for the pronounced substrate specificity of HI-6, we determined the binary crystal structures of Mus musculus AChE (mAChE) conjugated by cyclosarin and Russian VX and found a conformational mobility of the side chains of Phe338 and His447. The interaction between HI-6 and tabun-adducts of AChE were subsequently investigated using a combination of time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Our findings show that HI-6 binds to tabun inhibited Homo sapiens AChE (hAChE) with an IC50 value of 300muM and suggest that the reactive nucleophilic moiety of HI-6 is excluded from the phosphorus atom of tabun. We propose that a conformational mobility of the side-chains of Phe338 and His447 is a common feature in nerve-agent adducts of AChE. We also suggest that the conformational mobility allow HI-6 to reactivate conjugates of cyclosarin and Russian VX while a reduced mobility in tabun conjugated AChE results in steric hindrance that prevents efficient reactivation.",5.009,1144

Our previous study demonstrated that plasma miR-124 was down-regulated in NPC using microarray analysis and quantitative PCR validation. Though growing studies showed that down-regulated miR-124 was closely related to tumourigenesis in various types of cancers, the role of miR-124 in NPC remains largely unknown. METHODS: The expression level of miR-124 was evaluated in NPC cell lines and patient specimens using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Real-time qPCR). The clinicopathological significance of the resultant data was later analyzed. Then, we explored the role of miR-124 in NPC tumorigenesis by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Homo sapiens forkhead box Q1 (Foxq1) was confirmed as a novel direct target gene of miR-124 by the dual-luciferase assay and western bolt. RESULTS: We found that miR-124 was commonly down-regulated in NPC specimens and NPC cell lines. The expression of miR-124 was inversely correlation with clinical stages and marked on T stages. Then, the ectopic expression of miR-124 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we identified Foxq1 as a novel direct target of miR-124. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Foxq1 inhibited cell growth, migration and invasion, whereas Foxq1 overexpression partially rescued the suppressive effect of miR-124 in NPC. In clinical specimens, Foxq1 was commonly up-regulated in NPC, and the level increased with clinical stages and T stages. Additionally, the level of Foxq1 was inversely correlated with miR-124. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that miR-124 functions as a tumor-suppressive microRNA in NPC, and that its suppressive effects are mediated chiefly by repressing Foxq1 expression. MiR-124 could serve as an independent biomarker to identify patients with different clinical characteristics. Therefore, our findings provide valuable clues toward the understanding the of mechanisms of NPC pathogenesis and provide an opportunity to develop new effective clinical therapies in the future.",4.257,921

The study of pairwise correlations between such quantitative genomic variables as well as collective analysis of their interrelations by multidimensional methods have delivered crucial insights into the processes of molecular evolution. Here, we present a principal component analysis (PCA) of 16 genomic variables from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the largest data set analyzed so far. Because many missing values and potential outliers hinder the direct calculation of principal components, we introduce the application of Bayesian PCA. We confirm some of the previously established correlations, such as evolutionary rate versus protein expression, and reveal new correlations such as those between translational efficiency, phosphorylation density, and protein age. Although the first principal component primarily contrasts genomic change and protein expression, the second component separates variables related to gene existence and expressed protein functions. Enrichment analysis on genes affecting variable correlations unveils classes of influential genes. For example, although ribosomal and nuclear transport genes make important contributions to the correlation between protein isoelectric point and molecular weight, protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism genes help cause the lack of significant correlation between propensity for gene loss and protein age.

Comparing facial expressions may be particularly problematic, given that people tend to consider them categorically as emotional signals, which may affect how accurately specific details are processed. The bared-teeth display (BT), observed in most primates, has been proposed as a homologue of the human smile (J. A. R. A. M. van Hooff, 1972). In this study, judgments of similarity between BT displays of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and human smiles varied in relation to perceived emotional valence. When a chimpanzee BT was interpreted as fearful, observers tended to underestimate the magnitude of the relationship between certain features (the extent of lip corner raise) and human smiles.

We show here how UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (hUGDH) and UDP-xylose synthase 1 (hUXS) from Homo sapiens can be used for the efficient production of pure UDP-alpha-xylose from UDP-glucose. In a mimic of the natural biosynthetic route, UDP-glucose is converted to UDP-glucuronic acid by hUGDH, followed by subsequent formation of UDP-xylose by hUXS. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) required in the hUGDH reaction is continuously regenerated in a three-step chemo-enzymatic cascade. In the first step, reduced NAD+ (NADH) is recycled by xylose reductase from Candida tenuis via reduction of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ). Radical chemical re-oxidation of this mediator in the second step reduces molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that is cleaved by bovine liver catalase in the last step. A comprehensive analysis of the coupled chemo-enzymatic reactions revealed pronounced inhibition of hUGDH by NADH and UDP-xylose as well as an adequate oxygen supply for PQ re-oxidation as major bottlenecks of effective performance of the overall multi-step reaction system. Net oxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-xylose by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could thus be achieved when using an in situ oxygen supply through periodic external feed of H2O2 during the reaction. Engineering of the interrelated reaction parameters finally enabled production of 19.5 mM (10.5 g l-1) UDP-alpha-xylose. After two-step chromatographic purification the compound was obtained in high purity (>98%) and good overall yield (46%). The results provide a strong case for application of multi-step redox cascades in the synthesis of nucleotide sugar products.",5.663,937

Recently, POLE1 mutations were detected frequently in colorectal and endometrial carcinomas while with lower frequency in several other types of cancer, and the p.P286R and p.V411L mutations were the potential mutation hotspots in human cancers. Nevertheless, the mutation frequency of POLE1 in ovarian cancer still remains largely unknown. Here, we screened a total of 251 Chinese samples with distinct subtypes of ovarian carcinoma for the presence of POLE1 hotspot mutations by direct sequencing. A heterozygous somatic POLE1 mutation, p.S297F (c.890C>T), but not p.P286R and p.V411L hotspot mutations observed in other cancer types, was identified in 3 out of 37 (8.1%) patients with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma; this mutation was evolutionarily highly conserved from Homo sapiens to Schizosaccharomyces. Of note, the POLE1 mutation coexisted with mutation in the ovarian cancer-associated PPP2R1A (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit A, alpha) gene in a 46-year-old patient, who was also diagnosed with ectopic endometriosis in the benign ovary. In addition, a 45-year-old POLE1-mutated ovarian endometrioid carcinoma patient was also diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma while the remaining 52-year-old POLE1-mutated patient showed no additional distinctive clinical manifestation. In contrast to high frequency of POLE1 mutations in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, no POLE1 mutations were identified in patients with other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. Our results showed for the first time that the POLE1 p.S297F mutation, but not p.P286R and p.V411L hotspot mutations observed in other cancer types, was frequent in Chinese ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, but absent in other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. These results implicated that POLE1 p.S297F mutation might be actively involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, but might not be actively involved in other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma.",3.68,979

Although its effects on metastasis have been reported, its biological functions remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of TMSG1/LASS2 protein on apoptosis and proliferation in human embryonic kidney cell lines HEK293 and 293 T and explore the potential mechanisms. Cell growth, morphology, expressions of apoptotic-related proteins and cell cycle distribution were evaluated in HEK293 and 293 T cells transfected with TMSG1/LASS2 expression plasmids or vector controls. MTT assays showed that overexpression of TMSG1/LASS2 inhibited cell proliferation; and morphological observations and flow cytometric assays with Annexin V/propidium iodide showed TMSG1/LASS2 overexpression increased apoptosis in these cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of TMSG1/LASS2 resulted in the downregulation of Bcl-2, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, and the cleavage of PARP. Subsequent cell cycle analysis showed that TMSG1/LASS2 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation by mediating the induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Together, these results confirmed that TMSG1/LASS2 is a potential metastasis suppressor gene, and suggested that the mechanism involved the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation via a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway.",3.263,756

Conversely, the Out-of-Africa model considers the transition between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans as the result of a demographic replacement, and hence it predicts a genetic discontinuity between them. Following the most stringent current standards for validation of ancient DNA sequences, we typed the mtDNA hypervariable region I of two anatomically modern Homo sapiens sapiens individuals of the Cro-Magnon type dated at about 23 and 25 thousand years ago.

The obtained cDNA sequence was 1,435-bp long with an open reading frame of 1,266 bp encoding 421 amino acids.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that ApeIF-4A was transcribed at four developmental stages and in all tissues tested, suggesting that it plays an important role in development of A. pernyi. Homologous alignment suggested that eIF-4As are highly conserved throughout evolution of eukaryote organisms.

To fully understand S-glutathionylation mechanisms, identification of substrates and specific S-Glutathionylated sites is crucial. Experimental identification of S-glutathionylated sites is labor-intensive and time consuming, so establishing an effective computational method is much desirable due to their convenient and fast speed. Therefore, in this study, a new bioinformatics tool named SSGlu (Species-Specific identification of Protein S-glutathionylation Sites) was developed to identify species-specific protein S-glutathionylated sites, utilizing support vector machines that combine multiple sequence-derived features with a two-step feature selection. By 5-fold cross validation, the performance of SSGlu was measured with an AUC of 0.8105 and 0.8041 for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, respectively. Additionally, SSGlu was compared with the existing methods, and the higher MCC and AUC of SSGlu demonstrated that SSGlu was very promising to predict S-glutathionylated sites. Furthermore, a site-specific analysis showed that S-glutathionylation intimately correlated with the features derived from its surrounding sites. The conclusions derived from this study might help to understand more of the S-glutathionylation mechanism and guide the related experimental validation.

In humans, the alignment varies from concave to flat, and previous studies have suggested that this difference reflects craniofacial morphology, including the degree of alveolar prognathism. However, the relationship between prognathism and concavity of the COS has not been tested in craniofacially variant populations. We tested the hypothesis that greater alveolar prognathism covaries with a flatter COS in African-American and European-American populations. We further examined this relationship in fossil Homo including Homo neanderthalensis and early anatomically modern Homo sapiens, which are expected to extend the amount of variation in the COS from the extant sample. METHODS AND MATERIALS: These hypotheses were tested using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics. Landmarks were recorded from the skulls of 166 African-Americans, 123 European-Americans, and 10 fossil hominin mandible casts. Landmarks were subjected to generalized Procrustes analysis, principal components analysis, and two-block partial least squares analysis. RESULTS: We documented covariation between the COS and alveolar prognathism such that relatively prognathic individuals have a flatter COS. Mandibular data from the fossil hominin taxa generally confirm and extend this correlation across a greater range of facial size and morphology in Homo. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the magnitude of the COS is related to a suite of features associated with alveolar prognathism in modern humans and across anthropoids. We also discuss the implications for spatial interactions between the dental arches.",2.379,143

These evolutionary conserved polytopic membrane proteins are present in all phyla from simplest life forms (bacteria) to highly evolved eukaryotes (Homo sapiens). The presumed early function in metal detoxification remains the main function of Copper-ATPases in prokaryotic kingdom. In eukaryotes, in addition to removing excess copper from the cell, Copper-ATPases have another equally important function - to supply copper to copper dependent enzymes within the secretory pathway. This review focuses on the origin and diversification of Copper ATPases in eukaryotic organisms. From a single Copper ATPase in protozoans, a divergence into two functionally distinct ATPases is observed with the evolutionary appearance of chordates. Among the key functional domains of Copper-ATPases, the metal-binding N-terminal domain could be responsible for functional diversification of the copper ATPases during the course of evolution.",2.342,1410

The protein sequences are used as guides to scaffold existing contigs, while simultaneously allowing the gene structure to be predicted by homology. RESULTS: To perform, SWiPS does not depend on a high N50 or whole proteins being encoded on a single contig. We tested our algorithm on simulated next-generation data from Ciona intestinalis, real next-generation data from Drosophila melanogaster, a complex genome assembly of Homo sapiens and the low coverage Sanger sequence assembly of Callorhinchus milii. The improvements in N50 are of the order of  approximately 20% for the C.intestinalis and H.sapiens assemblies, which is significant, considering the large size of intergenic regions in these eukaryotes. Using the CEGMA pipeline to assess the gene space represented in the genome assemblies, the number of genes retrieved increased by >110% for C.milii and from 20 to 40% for C.intestinalis.

Both species showed similarly high levels of accuracy using proximity as a cue. Moreover, for both species, grouping by orientation similarity produced a lower level of performance than grouping by proximity. Differences emerged with respect to the use of shape similarity as a cue. In humans, grouping by shape similarity also proved less effective than grouping by proximity but the same was not observed in capuchins.

Paleoanthropologists employ enamel thickness in paleodietary and taxonomic studies regarding earlier hominins, but variation in enamel thickness within the genus Homo has not been thoroughly explored despite its potential to discriminate species and its relevance to studies of growth and development. Radiographic two-dimensional studies indicate that Neandertal molar enamel is thin relative to the thick enamel of modern humans, although such methods have limited accuracy. Here we show that, measured via accurate high-resolution microtomographic imaging, Neandertal molar enamel is absolutely and relatively thinner than modern human enamel at most molar positions. However, this difference relates to the ratio of coronal dentine volume to total crown volume, rather than the quantity of enamel per se. The absolute volume of Neandertal molar enamel is similar to that of modern humans, but Neandertal enamel is deposited over a larger volume of coronal dentine, resulting in lower average (and relative) enamel thickness values. Sample sizes do not permit rigorous intragroup comparisons, but Neandertal molar tissue proportions evince less variation than the modern human sample. Differences in three- and two-dimensional enamel thickness data describing Neandertal molars may be explained by dimensional reduction. Although molar tissue proportions distinguish Neanderthals from recent Homo sapiens, additional study is necessary to assess trends in tissue proportions in the genus Homo throughout the Pleistocene.",3.733,1839

The disease is characterized by damaged and deformed mitral valves predisposing them to scarring and narrowing (stenosis) that results in left atrial hypertrophy followed by heart failure. Presently, echocardiography is the main imaging technique used to diagnose Mitral Stenosis. Despite the high prevalence and increased morbidity, no biochemical indicators are available for prediction, diagnosis and management of the disease. Adopting a proteomic approach to study Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis may therefore throw some light in this direction. In our study, we undertook plasma proteomics of human subjects suffering from Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis (n = 6) and Control subjects (n = 6). Six plasma samples, three each from the control and patient groups were pooled and subjected to low abundance protein enrichment. Pooled plasma samples (crude and equalized) were then subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion separately. Digests were analyzed using nano LC-MS(E). Data was acquired with the Protein Lynx Global Server v2.5.2 software and searches made against reviewed Homo sapiens database (UniProtKB) for protein identification. Label-free protein quantification was performed in crude plasma only. RESULTS: A total of 130 proteins spanning 9-192 kDa were identified. Of these 83 proteins were common to both groups and 34 were differentially regulated. Functional annotation of overlapping and differential proteins revealed that more than 50% proteins are involved in inflammation and immune response. This was corroborated by findings from pathway analysis and histopathological studies on excised tissue sections of stenotic mitral valves. Verification of selected protein candidates by immunotechniques in crude plasma corroborated our findings from label-free protein quantification. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that this protein profile of blood plasma, or any of the individual proteins, could serve as a focal point for future mechanistic studies on Mitral Stenosis. In addition, some of the proteins associated with this disorder may be candidate biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

We examined MH1 using high radiation synchrotron to interpret features of the oronasal complex pertinent to facial growth.

We then constructed the ncRNA-protein interaction network corresponding to six model organisms, including Homo sapiens. The large-scale network analysis of ncRNA-protein interactions revealed a high degree of similarity for the degree distribution to that of the transcription regulatory network. Moreover, characterization of the local interaction structure of these networks based on motifs abundance also reveals significant similarities between ncRNA-protein and TFs-gene regulatory networks. Based on the identified motif abundance, we propose an evolutionary model that rebuilds the degree distribution and predicts the observed degree exponent. Taken together, our findings offer insights into the noncoding RNA-mediated regulation and provide knowledge about its structure and evolutionary mechanisms.",1.548,1676

In metazoans, these functions are mediated in part via coiled-coil Rab11-interacting proteins (FIPs) acting as Rab11 effectors. Additional interaction between Rab11 and the exocyst subunit Sec15 connects Rab11 with exocytosis. We find that FIPs are metazoan specific, suggesting that other factors mediate Rab11 functions in nonmetazoans. We examined Rab11 interactions in Trypanosoma brucei, where endocytosis is well studied and the role of Rab11 in recycling well documented. TbSec15 and TbRab11 interact, demonstrating evolutionary conservation. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified additional Rab11 interaction partners. Tb927.5.1640 (designated RBP74) interacted with both Rab11 and Rab5. RBP74 shares a coiled-coil architecture with metazoan FIPs but is unrelated by sequence and appears to play a role in coordinating endocytosis and recycling. A second coiled-coil protein, Tb09.211.4830 (TbAZI1), orthologous to AZI1 in Homo sapiens, interacts exclusively with Rab11. AZI1 is restricted to taxa with motile cilia/flagella. These data suggest that Rab11 functions are mediated by evolutionarily conserved (i.e., AZI1 and Sec15) and potentially lineage-specific (RBP74) interactions essential for the integration of the endomembrane system.",2.82,1514

The present study provides the first detailed morphometric description and comparisons of four hominin teeth (I(1), C1, P(3) and P3) from this site. Our study shows that the Panxian Dadong teeth combine archaic and derived features that align them with Middle and Upper Pleistocene fossils from East and West Asia and Europe. These teeth do not display any typical Neanderthal features and they are generally more derived than other contemporaneous populations from Asia and Africa. However, the derived traits are not diagnostic enough to specifically link the Panxian Dadong teeth to Homo sapiens, a common problem when analyzing the Middle Pleistocene dental record from Africa and Asia. These findings are contextualized in the discussion of the evolutionary course of Asian Middle Pleistocene hominins, and they highlight the necessity of incorporating the Asian fossil record in the still open debate about the origin of H. sapiens.",3.733,1099

A total of 49 humeral remains were recovered, representing 10 left and 8 right humeri from adults, adolescents, and a juvenile (not included in the analyses). 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methods as well as classic anthropological variables were employed to conduct a broad comparative analysis by means of mean centroid size and shape comparisons, principal components analysis, and cluster studies. Due to the fragmentary nature of the fossils, comparisons were organized in independent analyses according to different humeral portions: distal epiphysis, diaphysis, proximal epiphysis, and the complete humerus. From a multivariate viewpoint, 3D-GM analyses revealed major differences among taxonomic groups, supporting the value of the humerus in systematic classification. Notably, the Australopithecus anamensis (KP-271) and Homo ergaster Nariokotome (KNM-WT 15000) distal humerus consistently clusters close to those of modern humans, which may imply a primitive condition for Homo sapiens morphology. Australopithecus specimens show a high degree of dispersion in the morphospace. The El Sidron sample perfectly fits into the classic Neandertal pattern, previously described as having a relatively wide olecranon fossa, as well as thin lateral and medial distodorsal pillars. These characteristics were also typical of the Sima de los Huesos (Atapuerca) sample, African mid-Pleistocene Bodo specimen, and Lower Pleistocene TD6-Atapuerca remains and may be considered as a derived state. Finally, we hypothesize that most of the features thought to be different between Neandertals and modern humans might be associated with structural differences in the pectoral girdle and shoulder joint.",3.733,712

With the exception of OTLD1, plant OTU DUBs have not been characterized. We identified 12 Arabidopsis thaliana OTU loci and analyzed 11 of the encoded proteins in vitro to determine their preferences for the ubiquitin (UB) chains of M1, K48, and K63 linkages as well as the UB-/RUB-/SUMO-GST fusions. The A. thaliana OTU DUBs were shown to be cysteine proteases and classified into four groups with distinct linkage preferences: OTU1 (M1 = K48 > K63), OTU3/4/7/10 (K63 > K48 > M1), OTU2/9 (K48 = K63), and OTU5/11/12/OTLD1 (inactive). Five active OTU DUBs (OTU3/4/7/9/10) also cleaved RUB fusion. OTU1/3/4 cleaved M1 UB chains, suggesting a possible role for M1 chains in plant cellular signaling. The different substrate specificities of the various A. thaliana OTU DUBs indicate the involvement of distinct structural elements; for example, the OTU1 oxyanion residue D89 is essential for cleaving isopeptide bond-linked chains but dispensable for M1 chains. UB-binding activities were detected only for OTU2 and OTLD1, with distinct linkage preferences. These differences in biochemical properties support the involvement of A. thaliana OTU DUBs in different functions. Moreover, based on the established phylogenetic tree, plant- and H. sapiens-specific clades exist, which suggests that the proteins within these clades have taxa-specific functions. We also detected five OTU clades that are conserved across species, which suggests that the orthologs in different species within each clade are involved in conserved cellular processes, such as ERAD and DNA damage responses. However, different linkage preferences have been detected among potential cross-species OTU orthologs, indicating functional and mechanistic differentiation.",3.948,968

These isomiRs mainly originate via the imprecise and alternative cleavage during the pre-miRNA processing and post-transcriptional modifications that influence miRNA stability, their sub-cellular localization and target selection. Although several tools for the identification of isomiR have been reported, no bioinformatics resource dedicated to gather isomiRs from public NGS data and to provide functional analysis of these isomiRs is available to date. Thus, a free online database, IsomiR Bank has been created to integrate isomiRs detected by our previously published algorithm CPSS. In total, 2727 samples (Small RNA NGS data downloaded from ArrayExpress) from eight species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays) are analyzed. At present, 308 919 isomiRs from 4706 mature miRNAs are collected into IsomiR Bank.

21311596,Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism: a comparative study.,"['Karathia H', 'Vilaprinyo E', 'Sorribas A', 'Alves R']",PloS one,2011,"BACKGROUND: Model organisms are used for research because they provide a framework on which to develop and optimize methods that facilitate and standardize analysis. Such organisms should be representative of the living beings for which they are to serve as proxy. However, in practice, a model organism is often selected ad hoc, and without considering its representativeness, because a systematic and rational method to include this consideration in the selection process is still lacking. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work we propose such a method and apply it in a pilot study of strengths and limitations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The method relies on the functional classification of proteins into different biological pathways and processes and on full proteome comparisons between the putative model organism and other organisms for which we would like to extrapolate results. Here we compare S. cerevisiae to 704 other organisms from various phyla. For each organism, our results identify the pathways and processes for which S. cerevisiae is predicted to be a good model to extrapolate from. We find that animals in general and Homo sapiens in particular are some of the non-fungal organisms for which S. cerevisiae is likely to be a good model in which to study a significant fraction of common biological processes. We validate our approach by correctly predicting which organisms are phenotypically more distant from S. cerevisiae with respect to several different biological processes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The method we propose could be used to choose appropriate substitute model organisms for the study of biological processes in other species that are harder to study. For example, one could identify appropriate models to study either pathologies in humans or specific biological processes in species with a long development time, such as plants.",3.234,1594

Since oxidative processes are associated with aging and longevity, we might expect to see species differences in age-related oxidative processes. Blood and extracellular fluid contain two major thiol redox nodes, glutathione (GSH)/glutathione-disulfide (GSSG) and cysteine (Cys)/cystine (CySS), which are subject to reversible oxidation-reduction reactions and are maintained in a dynamic non-equilibrium state. Disruption of these thiol redox nodes leads to oxidation of their redox potentials (EhGSSG and EhCySS) which affects cellular physiology and is associated with aging and the development of chronic diseases in humans. The purpose of this study was to measure age-related changes in these redox thiols and their corresponding redox potentials (Eh) in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Our results show similar age-related decreases in the concentration of plasma GSH and Total GSH as well as oxidation of the EhGSSG in male and female chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees and female rhesus monkeys also were similar in several outcome measures. For example, similar age-related decreases in the concentration of plasma GSH and Total GSH, as well as age-related oxidation of the EhGSSG were observed. The data collected from chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys corroborates previous reports on oxidative changes in humans and confirms their value as a comparative reference for primate aging.",0,988

Previous work has been equivocal as to the contribution of postnatal growth and development to these differences. Due to disparate preservation, most analyses focus on specific anatomies, reconstructed fossils, or limited sample sizes. The objective of this research is to highlight the importance of postnatal growth in expressing Neandertal-human distinctions in the craniofacial skeleton, using a large and unreconstructed Neandertal sample. MATERIALS/METHODS: A resampling approach is utilized to compare relative size change in 20 craniofacial dimensions between Neandertals (n = 42) and humans (n = 262). The large number of immature Neandertal samples within and between dental stages provides the necessary variation to test for growth differences. Nested resampling using human-human comparisons assesses the likelihood of observing human-Neandertal growth differences under the null hypothesis of similar ontogenetic variation. RESULTS: Humans and Neandertals undergo comparable levels of overall size change. However, we identify growth differences for a number of traits, helping explain some of the unique features of this fossil taxon. Nested resampling shows it is unlikely that a Neandertal-like maturation would be observed in a random ontogenetic sample of humans. DISCUSSION: Growth during adolescence appears to be fundamental in the expression of some Neandertal anatomies. Neandertal upper facial and nasal breadths appear to have expanded rapidly after puberty to account for differences between preadolescents and adults, and Neandertals and humans. Mandibular growth differences may relate to anterior tooth use to process foods and paramastication during Neandertal maturation.",2.379,308

As such, SmPKA-C could potentially represent a novel schistosome chemotherapeutic target. Here we sought to identify PKA-C subunit orthologues in the other medically important schistosome species, Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma japonicum, to determine the degree to which this potential target is conserved and could therefore be exploited for the treatment of all forms of schistosomiasis. We report the identification of PKA-C subunit orthologues in S. haematobium and S. japonicum (ShPKA-C and SjPKA-C, respectively) and show that PKA-C orthologues are highly conserved in the Schistosoma, with over 99% amino acid sequence identity shared among the three human pathogens we examined. Furthermore, we show that the recently published Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum genomes contain sequences encoding for several putative PKA substrates with homology to those found in Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",1.638,1662

19995431,Codon usage is associated with the evolutionary age of genes in metazoan genomes.,"['Prat Y', 'Fromer M', 'Linial N', 'Linial M']",BMC evolutionary biology,2009,"BACKGROUND: Codon usage may vary significantly between different organisms and between genes within the same organism. Several evolutionary processes have been postulated to be the predominant determinants of codon usage: selection, mutation, and genetic drift. However, the relative contribution of each of these factors in different species remains debatable. The availability of complete genomes for tens of multicellular organisms provides an opportunity to inspect the relationship between codon usage and the evolutionary age of genes. RESULTS: We assign an evolutionary age to a gene based on the relative positions of its identified homologues in a standard phylogenetic tree. This yields a classification of all genes in a genome to several evolutionary age classes. The present study starts from the observation that each age class of genes has a unique codon usage and proceeds to provide a quantitative analysis of the codon usage in these classes. This observation is made for the genomes of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster. It is even more remarkable that the differences between codon usages in different age groups exhibit similar and consistent behavior in various organisms. While we find that GC content and gene length are also associated with the evolutionary age of genes, they can provide only a partial explanation for the observed codon usage. CONCLUSION: While factors such as GC content, mutational bias, and selection shape the codon usage in a genome, the evolutionary history of an organism over hundreds of millions of years is an overlooked property that is strongly linked to GC content, protein length, and, even more significantly, to the codon usage of metazoan genomes.",3.368,1879

These data confirm our previous results that nearly 1 million years ago at least one European hominin species had a fully modern pattern of dental development with a clear slowdown in the development of the molar field regarding the anterior dental field. Furthermore, using available information about enamel formation times and root extension rates in chimpanzees, early hominins, and modern humans, we have estimated that the formation time of the upper and lower first molars of individual 5 (H5) from TD6, which had just erupted at the time of the death of this individual, ranges between 5.3 and 6.6 y. Therefore, the eruption time of the first permanent molars (M1) in the TD6 hominins was within the range of variation of modern human populations. Because the time of M1 eruption in primates is a robust marker of life history, we suggest, as a working hypothesis, that these hominins had a prolonged childhood in the range of the variation of modern humans. If this hypothesis is true, it implies that the appearance in Homo of this important developmental biological feature and an associated increase in brain size preceded the development of the neocortical areas leading to the cognitive capabilities that are thought to be exclusive to Homo sapiens.",9.674,1645

Recently, geometric techniques have been developed for the direct analysis of landmark data. In this paper, we offer a summary (with examples) of three of these newer techniques, namely shape coordinate, thin-plate spline and relative warp analyses. Shape coordinate analysis detected significant craniofacial variation between 4 modern human populations, with African and Australian Aboriginal specimens being relatively prognathous compared with their Eurasian counterparts. In addition, the Australian specimens exhibited greater basicranial flexion than all other samples. The observed relationships between size and craniofacial shape were weak. The decomposition of shape variation into affine and non-affine components is illustrated via a thin-plate spline analysis of Homo and Pan cranial landmarks. We note differences between Homo and Pan in the degree of prognathism and basicranial flexion and the position and orientation of the foramen magnum. We compare these results with previous studies of these features in higher primates and discuss the utility of geometric morphometrics as a tool in primatology and physical anthropology.

In experimental group 2, one of two stimuli blinked during the first presentation but not the second presentation. Infants gazed for longer at the blinking stimulus in the first presentation, but there was no difference in looking time toward the two stimuli in the second presentation.

With this increased knowledge, the field has been rife with controversy. Moreover, with the advent of Whole Genome-Wide Studies (GWAS) and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), along with Functional Genome Convergence, the multiple-candidate gene approach still has merit and is considered by many as the most prudent approach. However, it is the combination of these two approaches that will ultimately define real, genetic allelic relationships, in terms of both risk and etiology. Since 1996, our laboratory has coined the umbrella term Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) to explain the common neurochemical and genetic mechanisms involved with both substance and non-substance, addictive behaviors. METHODS: This is a selective review of peer-reviewed papers primary listed in Pubmed and Medline. RESULTS: A review of the available evidence indicates the importance of dopaminergic pathways and resting-state, functional connectivity of brain reward circuits.

An evolutionary framework is appropriate in view of the paradoxical epidemiology of the disorders. Evolutionary models that rely on balanced polymorphism or group selection models are not supported by the evidence. Rather, a hypothesis is presented arguing that the spectrum of psychoses should be regarded as a costly by-product of social brain evolution in Homo sapiens. Under social selective pressures, hominid ancestors evolved a sophisticated neural network supporting social cognition and adaptive interpersonal behaviour--this is termed the 'social brain'. The functional psychoses (and schizophrenia in particular) are characterised by functional and structural deficits in these fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal circuits; hence the epithet 'social brain disorders' is fitting. I argue that accumulating evidence for an evolved social brain calls for a new philosophy of mind; a philosophy focussed on the social and interpersonal nature of human experience and derived from the philosophies of Fromm, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty.

In this paper, general features of the meningeal vascular traces are described for specimens included in the Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens hypodigms. The complexity of the arterial network is quantified by its fractal dimension, calculated through the box-counting method. Modern humans show significant differences from the other two taxa because of the anterior vascular dominance and the larger fractal dimension. Neither the fractal dimension nor the anterior development are merely associated with cranial size increase. Considering the differences between Neanderthals and modern humans, these results may be interpreted in terms of phylogeny, cerebral functions, or cranial structural network.",2.649,1265

The parasite has to overcome oxidative damage by ROS/RNS all along its life cycle to survive and to establish a chronic infection. We propose that T. cruzi is able to survive, among other mechanisms of detoxification, by repair of its damaged DNA through activation of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER is highly conserved in eukaryotes with apurinic/apirimidinic endonucleases (APEs) playing a fundamental role. Previous results showed that T. cruzi exposed to hydrogen peroxide and peroxinitrite significantly decreases its viability when co-incubated with methoxyamine, an AP endonuclease inhibitor. In this work the localization, expression and functionality of two T. cruzi APEs (TcAP1, Homo sapiens APE1 orthologous and TcAP2, orthologous to Homo sapiens APE2 and to Schizosaccaromyces pombe Apn2p) were determined. These enzymes are present and active in the two replicative parasite forms (epimastigotes and amastigotes) as well as in the non-replicative, infective trypomastigotes. TcAP1 and TcAP2 are located in the nucleus of epimastigotes and their expression is constitutive. Epimastigote AP endonucleases as well as recombinant TcAP1 and TcAP2 are inhibited by methoxyamine. Overexpression of TcAP1 increases epimastigotes viability when they are exposed to acute ROS/RNS attack. This protective effect is more evident when parasites are submitted to persistent ROS/RNS exposition, mimicking nature conditions. Our results confirm that the BER pathway is involved in T. cruzi resistance to DNA oxidative damage and points to the participation of DNA AP endonucleases in parasite survival.",3.263,680

Within the block of homology with Yp that was generated by a transposition between the chimpanzee and Homo sapiens we find two sequences, HS307 and HS408, with a high degree of homology to but not identity with the schizophrenic brain cDNA. The closest match of these three sequences is to a family of retroposons, that has evolved from the HERV-K family of endogenous retroviruses, some members of which (e.g., SINE-R.C2) appear to be specific to the human genome. This element has been reported as a cause of Fukuyama-type muscular dystrophy [Kobayashi et al., 1998: Nature 394:388-392]. Such retroposons, as agents of change in the human genome, provide a strategy for investigating pathogenesis.

In the first study, a spontaneous right-ear preference was observed during linguistic exchange between interacting individuals. This lateral bias was confirmed in a quasi-experimental study in which a confederate experimenter evoked an ear-orienting response in bystanders, under the pretext of approaching them with a whispered request. In the last study, subjects showed a greater proneness to meet an experimenter's request when it was directly addressed to the right rather than the left ear. Our findings are in agreement both with laboratory studies on hemispheric lateralization for language and approach/avoidance behavior in humans and with animal research.

Here, the authors examined monkeys' (Macaca mulatta) and humans' (Homo sapiens) learning of the important class of exclusive-or (XOR) categories. Both species exhibited--through a sustained level of ongoing errors--substantial difficulty learning XOR category tasks at 3 stimulus dimensionalities. Clearly, both species brought a linear-separability constraint to XOR category learning. This constraint illuminates the primate category-learning system from which that of humans arose, and it has theoretical implications concerning the evolution of cognitive systems for categorization.

I: Temporal trends and mechanical interpretation.,"['Ruff CB', 'Trinkaus E', 'Walker A', 'Larsen CS']",American journal of physical anthropology,1993,"Temporal trends in postcranial robusticity within the genus Homo are explored by comparing cross-sectional diaphyseal and articular properties of the femur, and to a more limited extent, the humerus, in samples of Recent and earlier Homo. Using both theoretical mechanical models and empirical observations within Recent humans, scaling relationships between structural properties and bone length are developed. The influence of body shape on these relationships is considered. These scaling factors are then used to standardize structural properties for comparisons with pre-Recent Homo (Homo sp. and H. erectus, archaic H. sapiens, and early modern H. sapiens). Results of the comparisons lead to the following conclusions: 1) There has been a consistent, exponentially increasing decline in diaphyseal robusticity within Homo that has continued from the early Pleistocene through living humans. Early modern H. sapiens are closer in shaft robusticity to archaic H. sapiens than they are to Recent humans. The increase in diaphyseal robusticity in earlier Homo is a result of both medullary contraction and periosteal expansion relative to Recent humans. 2) There has been no similar temporal decline in articular robusticity within Homo--relative femoral head size is similar in all groups and time periods. Thus, articular to shaft proportions are different in pre-Recent and Recent Homo. 3) These findings are most consistent with a mechanical explanation (declining mechanical loading of the postcranium), that acted primarily through developmental rather than genetic means. The environmental (behavioral) factors that brought about the decline in postcranial robusticity in Homo are ultimately linked to increases in brain size and cultural-technological advances, although changes in robusticity lag behind changes in cognitive capabilities.",2.379,1146

H. floresiensis was remarkable for its small body-size, endocranial volume in the chimpanzee range, limb proportions and skeletal robusticity similar to Pliocene Australopithecus, and a skeletal morphology with a distinctive combination of symplesiomorphic, derived, and unique traits. Critics of H. floresiensis as a novel species have argued that the Pleistocene skeletons from Liang Bua either fall within the range of living Australomelanesians, exhibit the attributes of growth disorders found in modern humans, or a combination of both. Here we describe the morphology of the LB1, LB2, and LB6 mandibles and mandibular teeth from Liang Bua. Morphological and metrical comparisons of the mandibles demonstrate that they share a distinctive suite of traits that place them outside both the H. sapiens and H. erectus ranges of variation. While having the derived molar size of later Homo, the symphyseal, corpus, ramus, and premolar morphologies share similarities with both Australopithecus and early Homo. When the mandibles are considered with the existing evidence for cranial and postcranial anatomy, limb proportions, and the functional anatomy of the wrist and shoulder, they are in many respects closer to African early Homo or Australopithecus than to later Homo. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the ancestors of H. floresiensis left Africa before the evolution of H. erectus, as defined by the Dmanisi and East African evidence.",3.733,1313

The interactions between RTN1-C and its interacting proteins were confirmed by beta-galactosidase assay and growth test in selective media. Moreover, the MANF/RTN1-C interaction was verified in vitro by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay and in vivo by immunoprecipitation assay.

In this study, we cloned the pig ST6GalNAc IV (pST6GalNAc IV) and investigated its functional characterization. pST6GalNAc IV cDNA has been isolated from pig liver tissues and it contains an entire open reading frame (ORF, 906 bp) coding for 302 amino acid residues.

Expression of pST6GalNAc IV mRNA in various pig tissues was identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. pST6GalNAc IV mRNA was highly expressed in tongue, muscle and heart, whereas it was not expressed in pancreas. For functional characterization of pST6GalNAc IV gene in pig kidney PK15 cells, we have also established pST6GalNAc IV-transfected PK15 cells, which are stably expressing the pST6GalNAc IV gene.

Recent studies have evidenced a marked variation also associated with its sulcal patterns. The present survey contributes to add further information on this topic, investigating the extension of its main folds, their geometrical influence on the lateral parietal areas, and the relationships with the sulcal schemes.

The subparietal sulcus is generally wider on the right hemisphere. Males have larger values than females, but differences are not significant. Sulcal pattern is not correlated with the size of the subparietal sulcus extension. There is a lack of consistent correspondence between hemispheres in the sulcal patterns, pointing further towards a notable individual variability and random asymmetries. The vertical extension of the precuneus influences the height and proportions of the upper parietal profile, but the lateral parietal outline is not sensitive to precuneal variation.

Initially, these studies were performed with a limited set of B-ZIP proteins, sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that dimerize using the leucine zipper domain to bind DNA. A global analysis of B-ZIP leucine zipper dimerization properties can be rationalized using a limited number of structural rules [J.R. Newman, A.E.

Today, however, access to the genomic sequences of many different organisms has made possible the annotation of all B-ZIP proteins from several species and has generated a bank of data that can be used to refine, and potentially expand, these rules. Already, a comparative analysis of the B-ZIP proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens has revealed that the same amino acids are used in different patterns to generate diverse B-ZIP dimerization patterns [C.D.

Gaining insight at this level will rely on ongoing investigations to (a) define the role of target DNA on modulating B-ZIP dimerization partners, (b) characterize the B-ZIP transcriptome in various cells and tissues through mRNA microarray analysis, (c) identify the genomic localization of B-ZIP binding at a genomic level using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and (d) develop more sophisticated imaging technologies to visualize dimer dynamics in single cells and whole organisms. Studies of B-ZIP family leucine zipper dimerization and the regulatory mechanisms that control their biological activities could serve as a paradigm for deciphering the biophysical and biological parameters governing other well-characterized protein-protein interaction motifs.

Indeed, pre-eclampsia is a consequence of the defect of the normal human-specific deep endovascular invasion of the trophoblast. The large size of the human fetal brain imposing this deep trophoblastic invasion induced the need for major immunogenetic compromises in terms of paternal-maternal tissue tolerance. The price that mankind has had to pay to adapt to the pre-eclampsia risk is a low fecundability rate and therefore loss of oestrus, possibly a step in the deviation between apes and hominids. Further, pre-eclampsia risk may be a contributing factor leading to the rejection of systematic polyandry in human societies and have influenced prohibition of incest.",1.204,1849

Clear demonstrations of such correspondences will be crucial to the discovery of the neurobiological underpinnings of higher-level cognition. One domain likely to support fruitful comparisons is interval timing, because humans and other animals appear to share basic similarities in their ability to discriminate the durations of events in the seconds-to-minutes range. Here, we report that in a duration-bisection procedure using a series of anchor durations ranging from 2 through 5 s, pigeon, mouse, and human subjects classified a given signal duration as subjectively shorter than an adjacent, physically shorter signal duration when the two durations lay on opposite sides of a putative category boundary.

25630102,Effect of mutation on aggregation propensity in homology model structures of syntaxin-3 from Homo sapiens.,[],Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics,2014,"Perception of molecular mechanism would provide potent additional knowledge on mammalian membrane proteins involved in causing diseases. In human, syntaxin-3 (STX3) is a significant apical targeting protein in the epithelial membrane and in exocytosis process; it also acts as a vesicle transporter by cellular receptor in neutrophils, which is crucial for protein trafficking event. Structurally, syntaxin-3 has hydrophobic domain at carboxyl terminus that directs itself to intra-cellular compartments. In addition, the experimental structure of STX3 is not available and no mutational study has been carried out with natural variants of proteins. Moreover, there is no evidence so far for the natural variant Val286 of STX3 causing any diseases. Hence, in the present study, analyses of residue-based properties of the homology model STX3 were carried out along with mutations at carboxyl terminus of STX3 by implementing protein engineering and in silico approaches. The model structure of STX3 was constructed adopting Modeller v9.11 and the aggregation propensity was analyzed with BioLuminate tool. The results showed that there was reduction in aggregation propensity with point mutation at Val286, instead of Ile, resulting into increasing the structural stability of STX3. In conclusion, the Ccap exposed residue would be a suitable position for further mutational studies, particularly with Val286 of STX3 in human. This approach could gainfully be applied to STX3 for efficient drug designing which would be a valuable target in the cancer treatment.",0.871,72
25232712,"Anthropology and the study of menopause: evolutionary, developmental, and comparative perspectives.",['Sievert LL'],"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",2014,"OBJECTIVE: This work aims to consider how the discipline of anthropology contributes to the study of menopause through evolutionary, developmental, and comparative perspectives. METHODS: This study was a review of skeletal and ethnographic evidence for menopause and postreproductive life in humans' distant past, hypotheses for the evolution of menopause and long postreproductive life, variation in age at menopause with focus on childhood environments, and the study of variation in symptom experience across populations. RESULTS: Longevity, rather than capacity for menopause, sets humans apart from other primates. Skeletal evidence demonstrates that some Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens lived to the age at menopause and that at least one third of women in traditional foraging populations live beyond menopause. The evolutionary reasons for why women experience a long postreproductive life continue to be debated. A developmental perspective suggests that early childhood may be a critical time for the environment to irreversibly influence the number of oocytes or rate of follicular atresia and, ultimately, age at menopause. A comparative perspective examines symptom experience at midlife through participant observation, qualitative interviews, and quantitative instruments to gain a holistic understanding of the meaning, experience, and sociocultural context of menopause. CONCLUSIONS: An evolutionary perspective suggests that menopause is not a recent phenomenon among humans. A developmental perspective focuses on the influence of early childhood on ovarian function. A comparative perspective expands clinical norms and provides knowledge about the range of human variations.",0,874

We explore the affinities of LB1 using cranial and postcranial metric and non-metric analyses. LB1 is compared to early Homo, two microcephalic humans, a 'pygmoid' excavated from another cave on Flores, H. sapiens (including African pygmies and Andaman Islanders), Australopithecus, and Paranthropus.

In this study we specify, for the first time, the binding site of apicularen within the membrane spanning V(O) complex. By photoaffinity labeling using derivatives of apicularen and of the plecomacrolides bafilomycin and concanamycin, each coupled to (14)C-labeled 4-(3-trifluoromethyldiazirin-3-yl)benzoic acid, we verified that apicularen binds at the interface of the V(O) subunits a and c.

Expression of subunit c homologues from Homo sapiens and Manduca sexta, both species sensitive to benzolactone enamides, in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking the corresponding intrinsic gene did not transfer this sensitivity to yeast.

Most researchers have focused on ER performance in modern humans, or on reconstructing ER performance in Homo erectus, however, few studies have examined ER capabilities in other members of the genus Homo. Here, we examine skeletal correlates of ER performance in modern humans in order to evaluate the energetics of running in Neandertals and early Homo sapiens. Recent research suggests that running economy (the energy cost of running at a given speed) is strongly related to the length of the Achilles tendon moment arm. Shorter moment arms allow for greater storage and release of elastic strain energy, reducing energy costs. Here, we show that a skeletal correlate of Achilles tendon moment arm length, the length of the calcaneal tuber, does not correlate with walking economy, but correlates significantly with running economy and explains a high proportion of the variance (80%) in cost between individuals. Neandertals had relatively longer calcaneal tubers than modern humans, which would have increased their energy costs of running. Calcaneal tuber lengths in early H. sapiens do not significantly differ from those of extant modern humans, suggesting Neandertal ER economy was reduced relative to contemporaneous anatomically modern humans. Endurance running is generally thought to be beneficial for gaining access to meat in hot environments, where hominins could have used pursuit hunting to run prey taxa into hyperthermia. We hypothesize that ER performance may have been reduced in Neandertals because they lived in cold climates.",3.733,1209

We have investigated the structure of the core of the human and yeast telomerase RNAs using SHAPE, which interrogates flexibility of each nucleotide. We present improved secondary-structure models, refined by addition of five base triples within the yeast pseudoknot and an alternate pairing within the human-specific element J2a.1 in the human pseudoknot, both of which have implications for thermodynamic stability. We also identified a potentially structured CCC region within the template that may facilitate substrate binding and enzyme mechanism.

To date, only paclitaxel and amodiaquine, two substrate markers of the human P450 2C8, have been experimentally confirmed as M. fascicularis P450 2C20 drugs. To bridge the lack of information on the ligands recognized by M. fascicularis P450 2C20, in this study, a three-dimensional homology model of this enzyme was generated on the basis of the available crystal structure of the human homologue P450 2C8 using YASARA. The results indicated that 90.0%, 9.0%, 0.5%, and 0.5% of the residues of the P450 2C20 model were located in the most favorable, allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively. The root-mean-square deviation of the C-alpha superposition of the M. fascicularis P450 2C20 model with the Homo sapiens P450 2C8 was 0.074 A, indicating a very high similarity of the two structures. Subsequently, the 2C20 model was used for in silico screening of 58 known P450 2C8 substrates and 62 inhibitors. These were also docked in the active site of the crystal structure of the human P450 2C8. The affinity of each compound for the active site of both cytochromes proved to be very similar, meaning that the few key residues that are mutated in the active site of the M. fascicularis P450 do not prevent the P450 2C20 from recognizing the same substrates as the human P450 2C8.",1.362,108

Analyzing infections and their spread in healthy metabolite networks can be one of the focussed areas in this regard. We have proposed a theory based on the classical forest fire model for analyzing the path of infection spread in healthy metabolic pathways. The theory suggests that when fire erupts in a forest, it spreads, and the surrounding trees also catch fire. Similarly, when we consider a metabolic network, the infection caused in the metabolites of the network spreads like a fire. We have constructed a simulation model which is used to study the infection caused in the metabolic networks from the start of infection, to spread and ultimately combating it. For implementation, we have used two approaches, first, based on quantitative strategies using ordinary differential equations and second, using graph-theory based properties. Furthermore, we are using certain probabilistic scores to complete this task and for interpreting the harm caused in the network, given by a 'critical value' to check whether the infection can be cured or not. We have tested our simulation model on metabolic pathways involved in Type I Diabetes mellitus in Homo sapiens. For validating our results biologically, we have used sensitivity analysis, both local and global, as well as for identifying the role of feedbacks in spreading infection in metabolic pathways. Moreover, information in literature has also been used to validate the results. The metabolic network datasets have been collected from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).",3.234,102

Here, we analyse lower limb entheses of the Krapina Neandertal bones (Croatia, 130,000 BP) with the aim of determining how they compare with modern humans, using a standard developed by our research group for describing modern human entheseal variability. The entheses examined are those of the gluteus maximus, iliopsoas and vastus medialis on the femur, the quadriceps tendon on the patella, and soleus on the tibia. For the entheses showing a different morphological pattern from H. sapiens, we discuss the possibility of recognising genetic versus environmental causes. Our results indicate that only the gluteus maximus enthesis (the gluteal tuberosity), falls out of the modern human range of variation. It displays morphological features that could imply histological differences from modern humans, in particular the presence of fibrocartilage. In both H. sapiens and the Krapina Neandertals, the morphological pattern of this enthesis is the same in adult and immature femurs. These results can be interpreted in light of genetic differences between the two hominins. The possibility of functional adaptations to higher levels of mechanical load during life in the Neandertals seems less likely.

However, no viable model has been established in a species that is more closely related to Homo sapiens. Here, we present a rabbit model of monocular photoreceptor degeneration. METHODS: We tested 2 chemicals, verteporfin and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), for developing a 1-eye limited photoreceptor degeneration model in pigmented rabbits. After the intravenous injection of verteporfin, the retina was exposed to light from a halogen lamp for 0, 10, 30, or 60 min. Alternately, 100 muL of various concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, and 1 mM) were intravitreously injected into the rabbit eye. Retinal degeneration was evaluated by fundus photography, electroretinogram (ERG), and histological examinations. RESULTS: Fundus photographs of animals in the verteporfin- or SNP-treated groups showed evidence of retinal degeneration. The severity of this degradation depended on the duration of light exposure and the concentration of SNP administered. The degeneration was clearly limited to the light-exposed areas in the verteporfin-treated groups. Extensive retinal atrophy was observed in the SNP-treated groups. The a- and b-wave amplitudes were dramatically decreased on the ERGs from SNP-treated groups. Histological examination revealed that either verteporfin or SNP induced severe photoreceptor degeneration. High-dose SNP treatment (1 mM) was also associated with inner retinal layer degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Both SNP and verteporfin clearly caused photoreceptor degeneration without any effect on the contralateral eye. These compounds therefore represent valuable tools for the empirical investigation of visual function recovery. The findings will inform guidelines for clinical applications such as retinal prostheses, cell-based therapy, and gene therapy.",1.02,1182

This research tested the hypothesis that long lower limbs and tibiae bring about increases in A-P bending forces on the lower limb during the stance phase of human walking. High-speed 3-D video data, force plates, and motion analysis software were used to analyze the walking gait of 27 modern human subjects. Limb length, as well as absolute and relative tibia length, were tested for associations with a number of kinetic and kinematic variables. Results show that individuals with longer limbs do incur greater bending moments along the lower limb during the first half of stance phase. During the second half of stance, individuals moderate bending moments through a complex of compensatory mechanisms, including keeping the knee in a more extended position. Neither absolute nor relative tibia length had any effect on the kinetic or kinematic variables tested. If these patterns apply to fossil Homo, groups with relatively long limbs (e.g. H. ergaster or early H. sapiens) may have experienced elevated bending forces along the lower limb during walking compared to those with relatively shorter limbs (e.g. the Neandertals). These increased forces could have led to greater reinforcement of joints and diaphyses. These results must be considered when formulating explanations for variation in limb morphology among Pleistocene hominins.",2.379,1544
26998318,She more than he: gender bias supports the empathic nature of yawn contagion in Homo sapiens.,"['Norscia I', 'Demuru E', 'Palagi E']",Royal Society open science,2016,"Psychological, clinical and neurobiological findings endorse that empathic abilities are more developed in women than in men. Because there is growing evidence that yawn contagion is an empathy-based phenomenon, we expect that the female bias in the empathic abilities reflects on a gender skew in the responsiveness to others' yawns. We verified this assumption by applying a linear model on a dataset gathered during a 5 year period of naturalistic observations on humans. Gender, age and social bond were included in the analysis as fixed factors. The social bond and the receiver's gender remained in the best model. The rates of contagion were significantly lower between acquaintances than between friends and family members, and significantly higher in women than in men. These results not only confirm that yawn contagion is sensitive to social closeness, but also that the phenomenon is affected by the same gender bias affecting empathy. The sex skew, also found in other non-human species, fits with the female social roles which are likely to require higher empathic abilities (e.g. parental care, group cohesion maintenance, social mediation). The fact that female influence in social dynamics also relies on face-to-face emotional exchange raises concerns on the negative repercussions of having women's facial expressions forcibly concealed.",0,34
25481629,Neanderthal exploitation of ibex and chamois in southwestern Europe.,"['Yravedra J', 'Cobo-Sanchez L']",Journal of human evolution,2015,"There is increasing evidence that Neanderthals had a diverse and flexible diet. They exploited a wide range of resources from large proboscideans to small animals like turtles, rabbits, and marine species. Here, we discuss the importance of ibex and chamois in Neanderthal hunting strategies. The exploitation of both animals has traditionally been regarded as typical of Homo sapiens hunting behavior but was not a feature of Neanderthal behavior, which was thought to have focused on other kinds of game like deer, horses or large bovids. Our analysis of an extensive sample of Middle Paleolithic sites with faunal remains in the Iberian Peninsula reveals that Iberian ibex and chamois were frequently present throughout this period. Statistical analyses allowed us to assess the conditions that might have favored the presence or absence of these animals in the sites, while the taphonomic analyses enabled us to address the issue of whether ibex and chamois were indeed hunted by Neanderthals in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results indicate a better representation of both species in rocky and mountainous areas. The taphonomy of some sites reveals that chamois and ibex were hunted by Neanderthals, who showed great adaptive capacities to a wide variety of environments, including mountainous habitats. In contrast, other sites with favorable ecological conditions for ibex and chamois where these animals were not exploited by Neanderthals, who chose to hunt other species like deer, horses or aurochs, suggest behavioral complexity and large versatility.",3.733,753

Nondestructive gamma-ray spectrometric dating of three of these Homo erectus skulls showed that all samples underwent uranium leaching. Nevertheless, we could establish minimum age estimates of around 40ka, with an upper age limit of around 60 to 70ka.

23400232,A Statistical Method without Training Step for the Classification of Coding Frame in Transcriptome Sequences.,"['Carels N', 'Frias D']",Bioinformatics and biology insights,2013,"In this study, we investigated the modalities of coding open reading frame (cORF) classification of expressed sequence tags (EST) by using the universal feature method (UFM). The UFM algorithm is based on the scoring of purine bias (Rrr) and stop codon frequencies. UFM classifies ORFs as coding or non-coding through a score based on 5 factors: (i) stop codon frequency; (ii) the product of the probabilities of purines occurring in the three positions of nucleotide triplets; (iii) the product of the probabilities of Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Adenine (A) occurring in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions of triplets, respectively; (iv) the probabilities of a G occurring in the 1st and 2nd positions of triplets; and (v) the probabilities of a T occurring in the 1st and an A in the 2nd position of triplets. Because UFM is based on primary determinants of coding sequences that are conserved throughout the biosphere, it is suitable for cORF classification of any sequence in eukaryote transcriptomes without prior knowledge. Considering the protein sequences of the Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB or more simply PDB) as a reference, we found that UFM classifies cORFs of >/=200 bp (if the coding strand is known) and cORFs of >/=300 bp (if the coding strand is unknown), and releases them in their coding strand and coding frame, which allows their automatic translation into protein sequences with a success rate equal to or higher than 95%. We first established the statistical parameters of UFM using ESTs from Plasmodium falciparum, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in reference to the protein sequences of PDB. Second, we showed that the success rate of cORF classification using UFM is expected to apply to approximately 95% of higher eukaryote genes that encode for proteins. Third, we used UFM in combination with CAP3 to assemble large EST samples into cORFs that we used to analyze transcriptome phenotypes in rice, maize, and humans. We discuss the error rate and the interference of noisy sequences such as pseudogenes, transposons, and retrotransposons. This method is suitable for rapid cORF extraction from transcriptome data and allows correct description of the genome phenotypes of plant genomes without prior knowledge. Additional care is necessary when addressing the human transcriptome due to the interference caused by large amounts of noisy sequences. UFM can be regarded as a low complexity tool for prior knowledge extraction concerning the coding fraction of the transcriptome of any eukaryote. Due to its low level of complexity, UFM is also very robust to variations of codon usage.",0,1234

This hypothesis is difficult to assess, however, without a clear understanding of how brain shape of microcephalics compares with that of normal humans. We compare three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstructions of the internal braincases (virtual endocasts that reproduce details of external brain morphology, including cranial capacities and shape) from a sample of 9 microcephalic humans and 10 normal humans. Discriminant and canonical analyses are used to identify two variables that classify normal and microcephalic humans with 100% success. The classification functions classify the virtual endocast from LB1 with normal humans rather than microcephalics. On the other hand, our classification functions classify a pathological H. sapiens specimen that, like LB1, represents an approximately 3-foot-tall adult female and an adult Basuto microcephalic woman that is alleged to have an endocast similar to LB1's with the microcephalic humans. Although microcephaly is genetically and clinically variable, virtual endocasts from our highly heterogeneous sample share similarities in protruding and proportionately large cerebella and relatively narrow, flattened orbital surfaces compared with normal humans. These findings have relevance for hypotheses regarding the genetic substrates of hominin brain evolution and may have medical diagnostic value. Despite LB1's having brain shape features that sort it with normal humans rather than microcephalics, other shape features and its small brain size are consistent with its assignment to a separate species.",9.674,1276

The Human HPSE protein sequences from various species were retrieved from GenBank database and were compared using sequence alignment. Multiple sequence alignment was done using Clustal-W with defaults and phylogenetic trees for the gene were built using neighbor-joining method as in BLAST 2.2.26+ version. A total of 112 BLAST hits were found for the heparanase query sequence and these hits showed putative conserved domain, Glyco_hydro_79n superfamily. We then narrowed down the search by manually deleting the proteins which were not HPSE-1. These sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analyses using the PhyML and TreeDyn software. Our study indicated that HPSE-1 is a conserved protein in classes Mammalia, Aves, Amphibia, Actinopterygii and Insecta emphasizing its importance in the physiology of cell membranes.

Here, we have established genome-wide chromosomal homologies between giraffe, Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi, MRE, 2n = 46) and human (Homo sapiens, HSA, 2n = 46) with whole sets of chromosome-specific paints from Chinese muntjac and human, in addition to providing a high-resolution G-banding karyotype of giraffe. Chinese muntjac and human chromosome paints detected 32 and 45 autosomal homologs in the genome of giraffe, respectively. Our results suggest that it would require at least thirteen fissions, six fusions and three intrachromosomal rearrangements to 'transform' the 2n = 44 eutherian ancestral karyotype to the 2n = 58 pecoran ancestral karyotype. During giraffe evolution, some ancestral eutherian syntenies (i.e. association of HSA3/21, 4/8, 7/16, 14/15, 16/19 and two forms of 12/22) have been retained, while several derived syntenies (i.e. associations of human homologous segments 2/1, 2/9, 5/19, 4/12/22, 8/9, and 10/20) have been produced. The reduction of chromosome number in giraffe from the 2n = 58 pecoran ancestral karyotype could be primarily attributed to extensive Robertsonian translocations of ancestral chromosomal segments. More complex chromosomal rearrangements (including tandem fusion, centromere repositioning and pericentric inversion) have happened during the evolution of GCA2 and GCA8.",1.561,379

The development of a non-reductionist theory of cellular functions in medicine is not sufficient. It is necessary to find the parameters with regards to molecules/genes that can elicit functions. This work shows that molecular interactions of gene products can be accomplished by biophysics logic. Defining the protein-associated factors in molecular activities and identifying its roles in molecular transduction are important. A misregulation in molecular switch can account for complex biomolecular consequences.

Several NKG2DL exhibit a considerable degree of genetic polymorphism, and although the functional significance of such allelic variation remains unclear, genetic variants have been implicated in susceptibility to infection and auto-immune disease. We used sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction to determine the frequency of 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding regions of genes of the RAET1/ULBP cluster in 223 Euro-Caucasoid, 60 Afro-Caribbean, and 52 Indo-Asian individuals to determine NKG2DL allele and haplotype frequencies within these populations. We show marked differences in the frequency of NKG2DL SNPs and haplotypes among the three ethnic groups, and certain haplotypes were observed almost exclusively in Afro-Caribbean compared with the Euro-Caucasoid and Indo-Asian populations. Interestingly, variation was focused within the RAET1E (ULBP4), RAET1L, and ULBP3 genes, whereas the ULBP1, ULBP2 and RAET1G (ULBP5) genes were highly conserved. These findings suggest that individual NKG2DL alleles have been subject to divergent selective pressures during the migration of Homo sapiens.

In populations with a moderate or high level of medicalized labor, there is evidence that the medical preferences interfere with the underlying biological mechanism for the circadian pattern of human birth. METHODS: This study analyses the hourly patterns of 4,599 single live births in the House of Maternity in Madrid between 1887 and 1892, a period of very limited obstetric intervention and without the influence of artificial lighting. In order to determine the influence of natural light on labor, two periods of maximum and minimum light have been established around the summer and winter solstices of the years in question. RESULTS: A clear circadian pattern of births emerges, with very early morning and early morning births dominating, and a sharp drop from midday until nightfall. The hourly distribution on both solstices follows this pattern, but with a clear peak shift: in winter, there is a greater concentration of deliveries in the early morning, whereas in the summer, the highest concentration is between 8 and 12 in the morning. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that non-intervened human birth has a clear diurnal cycle, with a higher incidence of deliveries in the early morning or morning. The shift in distribution during the winter and summer solstices seems to confirm the effect of light on the labor process.",1.204,899

Heart failure,2014,"Because of its comparatively recent evolution, Homo sapiens exhibit relatively little within-species genomic diversity. However, because of genome size, a proportionately small amount of variation creates ample opportunities for both rare mutations that may cause disease as well as more common genetic variations that may be important in disease modification or pharmacogenetics. Primarily because of the East African origin of modern humans, individuals of African ancestry (AA) exhibit greater degrees of genetic diversity than more recently established populations, such as those of European ancestry (EA) or Asian ancestry. Those population effects extend to differences in frequency of common gene variants that may be important in heart failure natural history or therapy. For cell-signaling mechanisms important in heart failure, we review and present new data for genetic variation between AA and EA populations. Data indicate that: 1) neurohormonal signaling mechanisms frequently (16 of the 19 investigated polymorphisms) exhibit racial differences in the allele frequencies of variants comprising key constituents; 2) some of these differences in allele frequency may differentially affect the natural history of heart failure in AA compared with EA individuals; and 3) in many cases, these differences likely play a role in observed racial differences in drug or device response.",0,856

Variation in rank ordering of body parts was nonrandom, and a cephalocaudal progression was evident for each behavior. Reliability of the behaviors as well as the correlations across rankings were highly significant, which indicates a generalized cephalocaudal progression for all 3 behaviors.

The molecular mechanisms, structural determinants and the binding energetics of the Aurora-A - INCENP complex owing to a single amino acid G198N mutation are not studied. Therefore, we have docked INCENP into human Aurora-A kinase, mutated Gly198 to Asn, Leu and Ala. The wild type and mutant Aurora-A - INCENP complexes were subjected to 40 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The Asn198 is located in the amphipathic cavity comprising Leu869IN, Glu868IN, Thr872IN, Tyr197AurA and Tyr199AurA and the interactions mediated via hydrogen bonds are important to stabilize the Aurora-AG198N - INCENP complex. The fluctuations in the secondary structural elements and the solvent accessible surface area of all the four complexes during the MD simulations were studied. We calculated the binding free energy upon mutation in the three mutant complexes.

We have searched the genome databases of 35 representative organisms from six kingdoms of life for PPP (Pro-Pro-Pro) and/or PPG (Pro-Pro-Gly)-encoding genes whose expression is expected to depend on eIF5A. We have made detailed analyses of proteome data of 5 selected species, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. The PPP and PPG motifs are low in the prokaryotic proteomes. However, their frequencies markedly increase with the biological complexity of eukaryotic organisms, and are higher in newly derived proteins than in those orthologous proteins commonly shared in all species. Ontology classifications of S. cerevisiae and human genes encoding the highest level of polyprolines reveal their strong association with several specific biological processes, including actin/cytoskeletal associated functions, RNA splicing/turnover, DNA binding/transcription and cell signaling. Previously reported phenotypic defects in actin polarity and mRNA decay of eIF5A mutant strains are consistent with the proposed role for eIF5A in the translation of the polyproline-containing proteins. Of all the amino acid tandem repeats (>/=3 amino acids), only the proline repeat frequency correlates with functional complexity of the five organisms examined.

A defined number of 171bp monomers are organized into chromosome-specific higher order repeats (HORs) that are reiterated thousands of times. At least half of all human chromosomes have two or more distinct HOR alpha satellite arrays within their centromere regions. We previously showed that the two alpha satellite arrays of Homo sapiens Chromosome 17 (HSA17), D17Z1 and D17Z1-B, behave as centromeric epialleles, that is, the centromere, defined by chromatin containing the centromeric histone variant CENPA and recruitment of other centromere proteins, can form at either D17Z1 or D17Z1-B. Some individuals in the human population are functional heterozygotes in that D17Z1 is the active centromere on one homolog and D17Z1-B is active on the other. In this study, we aimed to understand the molecular basis for how centromere location is determined on HSA17. Specifically, we focused on D17Z1 genomic variation as a driver of epiallele formation. We found that D17Z1 arrays that are predominantly composed of HOR size and sequence variants were functionally less competent. They either recruited decreased amounts of the centromere-specific histone variant CENPA and the HSA17 was mitotically unstable, or alternatively, the centromere was assembled at D17Z1-B and the HSA17 was stable.

CA has been cloned from the alimentary canal epithelium of Anopheles gambiae larvae and can generate bicarbonate, which is implicated as a buffer for the larval lumen. The question remains as to how the bicarbonate is transported from the cells into the lumen. We hypothesize the presence of a CA within the lumen itself to generate bicarbonate from CO(2) produced by the metabolically active alimentary canal cells. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel cytoplasmic-type alpha-CA from the larval An. gambiae alimentary canal. Antibody immunolocalization reveals a unique protein distribution pattern that includes the ectoperitrophic fluid, 'transitional region' of the alimentary canal, Malpighian tubules and a subset of cells in the dorsal anterior region of the rectum. Localization of this CA within the lumen of the alimentary canal may be a key to larval pH regulation, while detection within the rectum reveals a novel subset of cells in An. gambiae not described to date. Phylogenetic analysis of members of the alpha-CA family from the Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti and An. gambiae genomes shows a clustering of the novel CA with Homo sapiens CAs but not with other insect CAs.

We analyzed the regulation mode of the gene, the expression pattern and subcellular localization of the predicted protein in the cell, and its role involving in cell proliferation and cell cycle control. METHODS: Dual-luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA were used to analysis the basal transcriptional requirements of the predicted promoter regions. C1ORF109 expression was assessed by western blot analysis. The subcellular localization of C1ORF109 was detected by immunofluorescence and immune colloidal gold technique. Cell proliferation was evaluated using MTT assay and colony-forming assay. RESULTS: We found that two cis-acting elements within the crucial region of the c1orf109 promoter, one TATA box and one CAAT box, are required for maximal transcription of the c1orf109 gene. The 5' flanking region of the c1orf109 gene could bind specific transcription factors and Sp1 may be one of them. Employing western blot analysis, we detected upregulated expression of c1orf109 in multiple cancer cell lines. The protein C1ORF109 was mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, we also found that C1ORF109 was a phosphoprotein in vivo and could be phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2 in vitro. Exogenous expression of C1ORF109 in breast cancer Hs578T cells induced an increase in colony number and cell proliferation. A concomitant rise in levels of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and cyclinD1 expression was observed.

METHODS: A total of 59,691 heterospecific SNPs in 22 rhesus macaques and 20 humans were analyzed for human trait associations and 4207 heterospecific SNPs biallelic in both taxa were compared for genetic variation. RESULTS: Variation comparisons at the 4207 SNPs showed that humans were more genetically diverse than rhesus macaques with observed and expected heterozygosities of 0.337 and 0.323 vs. 0.119 and 0.102, and minor allele frequencies of 0.239 and 0.063, respectively. In total, 431 of the 59,691 heterospecific SNPs are reportedly associated with human-specific traits. CONCLUSION: While comparisons between human and rhesus macaque genomes are plausible, functional studies of heterospecific SNPs are necessary to determine whether rhesus macaque alleles are associated with the same phenotypes as their corresponding human alleles.",0.819,405

 1989)",2002,"PROBLEM: Mapping the human genome and advances in human evolution indicate a critical role for genetics in the study of reproduction. METHOD OF STUDY: Literature in human evolution, genetics and reproduction. RESULTS: This paper will focus on three points: (1) the course of primate evolution, (2) implications of this course for reproduction in humans, and (3) evolutionary mechanisms. Reproduction is the driving force of evolution, and sex selection is the important factor in determining reproductive activity. The hypothesis will be presented that the reproductive inefficiency of Homo sapiens (one of four pregnancies succeeds) is the consequence of the development of genetic isolation from other species of Homo that was necessary to drive the evolution of Homo sapiens. This hypothesis is based on the evidence that Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis are separate species and that intermating would not yield fertile offspring (Haldane's Rule). This mating barrier involves zoological and linguistic differences and genetic mechanisms preventing fertile interspecies mating (chromosomal incompatibilities, disruption of genomic imprinting and recessive lethal defects). CONCLUSIONS: The medical and philosophical implications of modern reproductive technologies that may circumvent mating barriers must be addressed prospectively: propagation of genetic defects that would be eliminated by natural selection; the specter of 'genetic enhancement'; human cloning; and attempts to control the future direction of the evolution of Homo sapiens.",1.204,1303
18692219,"Stratigraphy and tephra of the Kibish Formation, southwestern Ethiopia.","['Brown FH', 'Fuller CR']",Journal of human evolution,2008,"The Kibish Formation in southwestern Ethiopia, with an aggregate thickness of approximately 105 m, consists of lacustrine, marginal lacustrine, and deltaic deposits. It is divided into four members numbered I to IV on the basis of erosion surfaces (disconformities) between the strata of each member. It overlies the Mursi and Nkalabong formations, the latter of which is here shown to correlate with the Shungura Formation. Tephra layers in each member allow for secure correlation between geographically separated sections on the basis of the composition of their volcanic glass. Members I, III, and IV of the Kibish Formation appear to have been deposited at the same times as sapropels S7 (197 ka), S4 (104 ka), and S1 (8 ka) in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, respectively. We correlate the KHS Tuff of the Kibish Formation with a >154-kyr-old unnamed tuff in the Konso Formation. Tephra in Member IV may derive from Mount Wenchi, a volcano situated on the divide between the Omo and Blue Nile drainage basins. Thin-bedded sedimentary layers probably represent annual deposition reflecting rapid sedimentation (approximately 30 m/kyr) of parts of the formation. This conclusion is supported by variation in paleomagnetic inclination through a sequence of these layers at KHS. Two fossils of early Homo sapiens (Omo I and Omo II) derive from Member I. Their stratigraphic placement is confirmed by analysis of the KHS Tuff in the lower part of Member II at both fossil sites. The KHS Tuff lies above a disconformity, which itself lies above the fossils at both sites. (40)Ar/(39)Ar dates provide an estimated age of approximately 195 kyr for these fossils. Omo III, a third fossil H. sapiens, probably also derives from Member I of the Kibish Formation and is of similar age. Hominin fossils from AHS, a new site, also derive from Member I. Hominin fossils from CHS can only be placed between 104 ka and 10 ka, the H. sapiens specimen from JHS is most likely 9-13 kyr in age, and a partial skeleton of H. sapiens from Pelvic Corner is most likely approximately 6.6 kyr in age.",3.733,1695

Parameter measurements included: diameter, perimeter and area of Haversian canal and osteon; distance between centers of Haversian canals; and ratio between diameter of Haversian canal and osteon. Four parameters, including diameters and areas of Haversian canal and osteon, demonstrated significantly higher (P<0.05) values in humans than in Assam macaques.

Comparing limb biomechanics among fossil Homo, varsity athletes and Holocene foragers.","['Shaw CN', 'Stock JT']",Journal of human evolution,2013,"Descriptions of Pleistocene activity patterns often derive from comparisons of long bone diaphyseal robusticity across contemporaneous fossilized hominins. The purpose of this study is to augment existing understanding of Pleistocene hominin mobility patterns by interpreting fossil variation through comparisons with a) living human athletes with known activity patterns, and b) Holocene foragers where descriptions of group-level activity patterns are available. Relative tibial rigidity (midshaft tibial rigidity (J)/midshaft humeral rigidity (J)) was compared amongst Levantine and European Neandertals, Levantine and Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens, Holocene foragers and living human athletes and controls. Cross-country runners exhibit significantly (p<0.05) greater relative tibial rigidity compared with swimmers, and higher values compared with controls. In contrast, swimmers displayed significantly (p<0.05) lower relative tibial rigidity than both runners and controls. While variation exists among all Holocene H. sapiens, highly terrestrially mobile Later Stone Age (LSA) southern Africans and cross-country runners display the highest relative tibial rigidity, while maritime Andaman Islanders and swimmers display the lowest, with controls falling between. All fossil hominins displayed relative tibial rigidity that exceeded, or was similar to, the highly terrestrially mobile Later Stone Age southern Africans and modern human cross-country runners. The more extreme skeletal structure of most Neandertals and Levantine H. sapiens, as well as the odd Upper Palaeolithic individual, appears to reflect adaptation to intense and/or highly repetitive lower limb (relative to upper limb) loading. This loading may have been associated with bipedal travel, and appears to have been more strenuous than that encountered by even university varsity runners, and Holocene foragers with hunting grounds 2000-3000 square miles in size. Skeletal variation among the athletes and foraging groups is consistent with known or inferred activity profiles, which support the position that the Pleistocene remains reflect adaptation to extremely active and mobile lives.",3.733,238

Biological sciences / The Royal Society,2013,"The extremely small endocranial volume (ECV) of LB1, the type specimen of Homo floresiensis, poses a challenge in our understanding of human brain evolution. Some researchers hypothesize dramatic dwarfing of relative brain size from Homo erectus presumably without significant decrease in intellectual function, whereas others expect a lesser degree of brain diminution from a more primitive, small-brained form of hominin currently undocumented in eastern Asia. However, inconsistency in the published ECVs for LB1 (380-430 cc), unclear human intraspecific brain-body size scaling and other uncertainties have hampered elaborative modelling of its brain size reduction. In this study, we accurately determine the ECV of LB1 using high-resolution micro-CT scan. The ECV of LB1 thus measured, 426 cc, is larger than the commonly cited figure in previous studies (400 cc). Coupled with brain-body size correlation in Homo sapiens calculated based on a sample from 20 worldwide modern human populations, we construct new models of the brain size reduction in the evolution of H. floresiensis. The results show a more significant contribution of scaling effect than previously claimed.",0,242

Here, we report biochemical and structural data that define the N-terminal domain of the Homo sapiens ZNF451 as the catalytic module for SUMO E3 ligase activity. The ZNF451 catalytic module contains tandem SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) bridged by a Pro-Leu-Arg-Pro (PLRP) motif. The first SIM and PLRP motif engage thioester-charged E2~SUMO while the next SIM binds a second molecule of SUMO bound to the back side of E2. We show that ZNF451 is SUMO2 specific and that SUMO modification of ZNF451 may contribute to activity by providing a second molecule of SUMO that interacts with E2. Our results are consistent with ZNF451 functioning as a bona fide SUMO E3 ligase.",13.309,658

Our sample consists of 38 crania: 20 modern adult Homo sapiens, 14 sub-adult H. sapiens, and four archaic Homo. All specimens were CT-scanned except for two infant H. sapiens, who were imaged by MR instead. For each specimen 84 landmarks and semi-landmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial length to height ratio not reducible to either process.

Different individual features in the lower arm bones have been described to distinguish Neanderthals from modern humans. In this study, the overall morphology of the radius and ulna is considered, and morphological differences among Neanderthals, Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens and recent H. sapiens are described. Comparisons among populations were made using a combination of 3D geometric morphometrics and standard multivariate methods. Comparative material included all available complete radii and ulnae from Neanderthals, early H. sapiens and archaeological and recent human populations, representing a wide geographical and lifestyle range. There are few differences among the populations when features are considered individually. Neanderthals and early H. sapiens fell within the range of modern human variation. When the suite of measurements and shapes were analyzed, differences and similarities became apparent. The Neanderthal radius is more laterally curved, has a more medially placed radial tuberosity, a longer radial neck, a more antero-posteriorly ovoid head and a well-developed proximal interosseous crest. The Neanderthal ulna has a more anterior facing trochlear notch, a lower M. brachialis insertion, larger relative mid-shaft size and a more medio-lateral and antero-posterior sinusoidal shaft. The Neanderthal lower arm morphology reflects a strong cold-adapted short forearm. The forearms of H. sapiens are less powerful in pronation and supination. Many differences between Neanderthals and H. sapiens can be explained as a secondary consequence of the hyper-polar body proportions of the Neanderthals, but also as retentions of the primitive condition of other hominoids.",3.733,974

27503290,Mechanistically distinct pathways of divergent regulatory DNA creation contribute to evolution of human-specific genomic regulatory networks driving phenotypic divergence of Homo sapiens.,['Glinsky GV'],Genome biology and evolution,2016,"Thousands of candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) have been identified, supporting the hypothesis that unique to human phenotypes result from human-specific alterations of genomic regulatory networks. Collectively, a compendium of multiple diverse families of HSRS that are functionally and structurally divergent from Great Apes could be defined as the backbone of human-specific genomic regulatory networks. Here, the conservation patterns analysis of 18,364 candidate HSRS was carried out requiring that 100% of bases must remap during the alignments of human, chimpanzee, and bonobo sequences. A total of 5,535 candidate HSRS were identified that are: i) highly conserved in Great Apes; ii) evolved by the exaptation of highly conserved ancestral DNA; iii) defined by either the acceleration of mutation rates on the human lineage or the functional divergence from nonhuman primates. The exaptation of highly conserved ancestral DNA pathway seems mechanistically distinct from the evolution of regulatory DNA segments driven by the species-specific expansion of transposable elements. Genome-wide proximity placement analysis of HSRS revealed that a small fraction of topologically-associating domains (TADs) contain more than half of HSRS from four distinct families. TADs that are enriched for HSRS and termed rapidly-evolving in humans TADs (revTADs) comprise 0.8% - 10.3% of 3,127 TADs in the hESC genome. RevTADs manifest distinct correlation patterns between placements of human accelerated regions, human-specific transcription factor-binding sites, and recombination rates. There is a significant enrichment within revTAD boundaries of hESC-enhancers, primate-specific CTCF-binding sites, human-specific RNAPII-binding sites, hCONDELs, and H3K4me3 peaks with human-specific enrichment at TSS in prefrontal cortex neurons (p < 0.0001 in all instances). Present analysis supports the idea that phenotypic divergence of Homo sapiens is driven by the evolution of human-specific genomic regulatory networks via at least two mechanistically distinct pathways of creation of divergent sequences of regulatory DNA: i) recombination-associated exaptation of the highly conserved ancestral regulatory DNA segments; ii) human-specific insertions of transposable elements.",4.229,12

Its differential expression in these mammals is correlated with signaling for sex determination. As a way of studying sex determination in fish we cloned and analyzed a RSPO1 gene in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using real-time PCR, we observed that RSPO1 is expressed more strongly in ovaries than in testes, suggesting that RSPO1 may have a role in gonad differentiation. High RSPO1 expression was detected in some non-gonadal organs like muscle and kidneys. In situ hybridization results demonstrate that RSPO1 is expressed in premature germ cells, in oogonia and primary oocytes in ovaries and in spermatogonia and spermatocytes in testes. It is also expressed in gonad somatic cells during gonadal development: in granulosa cells and theca cells of early and late cortical-alveolar stage follicles in ovaries, and in Leydig cells in testes. This differential expression may indicate that RSPO1 has a role(s) in zebrafish gonad development and differentiation. By fusing zebrafish RSPO1 with a green fluorescent protein gene, we found that RSPO1 is located in the cytosol and Golgi apparatus but not the nucleus of fish epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells. These preliminary findings suggest some aspects of RSPO1 like differential expression linked to sex determination may be conserved in fish while other aspects like subcellular localization differ from the mammalian RSPO1.",2.024,1625

Current methods are based on breaking down studies into multiple comparisons between phenotypes (e.g. disease vs. healthy), based on the studies' experimental designs, followed by computing the overlap between the resulting differential expression signatures. While useful, in this methodology each study yields multiple independent phenotype comparisons, and connections are established not between studies, but rather between subsets of the studies corresponding to phenotype comparisons. We propose a rank-based statistical meta-analysis framework that establishes global connections between transcriptomics studies without breaking down studies into sets of phenotype comparisons. By using a rank product method, our framework extracts global features from each study, corresponding to genes that are consistently among the most expressed or differentially expressed genes in that study. Those features are then statistically modelled via a term-frequency inverse-document frequency (TF-IDF) model, which is then used for connecting studies. Our framework is fast and parameter-free; when applied to large collections of Homo sapiens and Streptococcus pneumoniae transcriptomics studies, it performs better than similarity-based approaches in retrieving related studies, using a Medical Subject Headings gold standard. Finally, we highlight via case studies how the framework can be used to derive novel biological hypotheses regarding related studies and the genes that drive those connections. Our proposed statistical framework shows that it is possible to perform a meta-analysis of transcriptomics studies with arbitrary experimental designs by deriving global expression features rather than decomposing studies into multiple phenotype comparisons.",3.234,1015

Walking over the sensor caused a pleasant music to be played in the environment, thus engaging children in a playful spatial search. Children easily learned to find the centre of the training environment starting from random positions. After training, children were tested in enclosures of different size and/or shape: a larger square-shaped enclosure (3mx3m), a rectangle-shaped enclosure (1.5mx3m), an equilateral triangle-shaped enclosure (side 3m) and an isosceles triangle-shaped enclosure (base 1.5m; sides 3m). Children searched in the central region of the enclosures, their precision varying as a function of the similarity of the testing enclosure's shape to the shape of the training enclosure. This suggests that a relational spatial strategy was used, and that it depended on the encoding of geometrical shape. This result highlights a distinctive role of the geometric centre of enclosed spaces in place learning in children, as already observed in nonhuman species.",1.567,78

While acknowledging the importance of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in the regulation of acid base balance, the hypothesis seeks to define the specific neuroendocrine/vascular mechanisms at work in regulating acid base balance in hypoxia and infection. The SIA (serotonin-immune-adrenergic) system is proposed as a working model, which allows central nervous system and endocrine-mediated macro- and micro vascular 'fine tuning'. The neurotransmitter serotonin serves as a 'hypoxic sensor' in concert with other operators to orchestrate homeostatic balance in normal and pathological states. The SIA system finely regulates oxygen, fuel and metabolic buffering systems at local sites to ensure optimum conditions for the immune response. The SIA system is fragile and its operation may be affected by infection, stress, diet, environmental toxins and lack of exercise. The hypothesis provides new insight in the area of neuro-gastroenterology, and emphasizes the importance of diet and nutrition as a complement in the treatment of infection, as well as the normalization of intestinal flora following antibiotic therapy.",1.074,1163
27425574,Trichinella spiralis: Adaptation and parasitism.,"['Zarlenga D', 'Wang Z', 'Mitreva M']",Veterinary parasitology,2016,"Publication of the genome from the clade I organism, Trichinella spiralis, has provided us an avenue to address more holistic problems in parasitology; namely the processes of adaptation and the evolution of parasitism. Parasitism among nematodes has evolved in multiple, independent events. Deciphering processes that drive species diversity and adaptation are keys to understanding parasitism and advancing control strategies. Studies have been put forth on morphological and physiological aspects of parasitism and adaptation in nematodes; however, data is now coming available to investigate adaptation, host switching and parasitism at the genomic level. Herein we compare proteomic data from the clade I parasite, Trichinella spiralis with data from Brugia malayi (clade III), Meloidogyne hapla and Meloidogyne incognita (clade IV), and free-living nematodes belonging to the genera Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus (clade V). We explore changes in protein family birth/death and expansion/reduction over the course of metazoan evolution using Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as outgroups for the phylum Nematoda. We further examine relationships between these changes and the ability and/or result of nematodes adapting to their environments. Data are consistent with gene loss occurring in conjunction with nematode specialization resulting from parasitic worms acclimating to well-defined, environmental niches. We observed evidence for independent, lateral gene transfer events involving conserved genes that may have played a role in the evolution of nematode parasitism. In general, parasitic nematodes gained proteins through duplication and lateral gene transfer, and lost proteins through random mutation and deletions. Data suggest independent acquisition rather than ancestral inheritance among the Nematoda followed by selective gene loss over evolutionary time. Data also show that parasitism and adaptation affected a broad range of proteins, especially those involved in sensory perception, metabolism, and transcription/translation. New protein gains with functions related to regulating transcription and translation, and protein family expansions with functions related to morphology and body development have occurred in association with parasitism. Further gains occurred as a result of lateral gene transfer and in particular, with the cyanase protein family In contrast, reductions and/or losses have occurred in protein families with functions related to metabolic process and signal transduction. Taking advantage of the independent occurrences of parasitism in nematodes, which enabled us to distinguish changes associated with parasitism from species specific niche adaptation, our study provides valuable insights into nematode parasitism at a proteome level using T. spiralis as a benchmark for early adaptation to or acquisition of parasitism.",2.46,626

In total, 28 mutants were found in 16 independent events (13 singletons and three clusters). The molecular nature of the 13 events was analyzed. Coding exons of the locus were affected by insertions or deletions >100 nucleotides long (6 events), short frameshift insertions or deletions (4 events), and replacement nucleotide substitutions (1 event). In the case of 2 mutant alleles, coding regions were not affected. Because approximately 70% of spontaneous de novo loss-of-function mutations in Homo sapiens are due to nucleotide substitutions within coding regions, insertions and deletions appear to play a much larger role in spontaneous mutation in D. melanogaster than in H. sapiens. If so, the per nucleotide mutation rate in D. melanogaster may be lower than in H. sapiens, even if their per locus mutation rates are similar.",5.963,1872

Limited sequence analysis previously showed that HTLV-4 may be distinct from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3, and their simian counterparts, STLV-1, STLV-2, and STLV-3, respectively. Analysis of full-length genomes can provide basic information on the evolutionary history and replication and pathogenic potential of new viruses. RESULTS: We report here the first complete HTLV-4 sequence obtained by PCR-based genome walking using uncultured peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from an HTLV-4-infected person. The HTLV-4(1863LE) genome is 8791-bp long and is equidistant from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 sharing only 62-71% nucleotide identity. HTLV-4 has a prototypic genomic structure with all enzymatic, regulatory, and structural proteins preserved. Like STLV-2, STLV-3, and HTLV-3, HTLV-4 is missing a third 21-bp transcription element found in the long terminal repeats of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 but instead contains unique c-Myb and pre B-cell leukemic transcription factor binding sites. Like HTLV-2, the PDZ motif important for cellular signal transduction and transformation in HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 is missing in the C-terminus of the HTLV-4 Tax protein. A basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP) region located in the antisense strand of HTLV-1 and believed to play a role in viral replication and oncogenesis, was also found in the complementary strand of HTLV-4. Detailed phylogenetic analysis shows that HTLV-4 is clearly a monophyletic viral group. Dating using a relaxed molecular clock inferred that the most recent common ancestor of HTLV-4 and HTLV-2/STLV-2 occurred 49,800 to 378,000 years ago making this the oldest known PTLV lineage. Interestingly, this period coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens during the Middle Pleistocene suggesting that early humans may have been susceptible hosts for the ancestral HTLV-4. CONCLUSION: The inferred ancient origin of HTLV-4 coinciding with the appearance of Homo sapiens, the propensity of STLVs to cross-species into humans, the fact that HTLV-1 and -2 spread globally following migrations of ancient populations, all suggest that HTLV-4 may be prevalent. Expanded surveillance and clinical studies are needed to better define the epidemiology and public health importance of HTLV-4 infection.",4.185,1665
25813423,"Homo erectus in Salkhit, Mongolia?",['Lee SH'],"Homo : internationale Zeitschrift fur die vergleichende
 Forschung am Menschen",2015,"In 2006, a skullcap was discovered in Salkhit, Mongolia. The Salkhit skullcap has a mostly complete frontal, two partially complete parietals, and nasals. No chronometric dating has been published yet, and suggested dates range from early Middle Pleistocene to terminal Late Pleistocene. While no chronometric date has been published, the presence of archaic features has led to a potential affiliation with archaic hominin species. If it is indeed Homo erectus or archaic Homo sapiens, Salkhit implies a much earlier spread of hominins farther north and inland Asia than previously thought. In this paper, the nature of the archaic features in Salkhit is investigated. The Salkhit skullcap morphology and metrics were compared with Middle and Late Pleistocene hominin fossils from northeast Asia: Zhoukoudian Locality 1, Dali, and Zhoukoudian Upper Cave. Results show an interesting pattern: on one hand, the archaic features that Salkhit shares with the Zhoukoudian Locality 1 sample also are shared with other later hominins; on the other hand, Salkhit is different from the Middle Pleistocene materials in the same way later hominins differ from the Middle Pleistocene sample, in having a broader frontal and thinner supraorbital region. This may reflect encephalization and gracilization, a modernization trend found in many places. It is concluded that the archaic features observed in Salkhit are regionally predominant features rather than diagnostic features of an archaic species.",0,131
21059373,A review of lateralization of spatial functioning in nonhuman primates.,"['Oleksiak A', 'Postma A', 'van der Ham IJ', 'Klink PC', 'van Wezel RJ']",Brain research reviews,2011,"The majority of research on functional cerebral lateralization in primates revolves around vocal abilities, addressing the evolutionary origin of the human language faculty and its predominance in the left hemisphere of the brain. Right hemisphere specialization in spatial cognition is commonly reported in humans. This functional asymmetry is especially evident in the context of the unilateral neglect, a deficit in attention to and awareness of one side of space, that more frequently occurs after right-side rather than left-side brain damage. Since most of the research efforts are concentrated on vocalization in primates, much less is known about the presence or absence of spatial functions lateralization. Obtaining this knowledge can provide insight into the evolutionary aspect of the functionally lateralized brain of Homo sapiens and deliver refinement and validation of the nonhuman primate unilateral neglect model. This paper reviews the literature on functional brain asymmetries in processing spatial information, limiting the search to nonhuman primates, and concludes there is no clear evidence that monkeys process spatial information with different efficiency in the two hemispheres. We suggest that lateralization of spatial cognition in humans represents a relatively new feature on the evolutionary time scale, possibly developed as a by-product of the left hemisphere intrusion of language competence. Further, we argue that the monkey model of hemispatial neglect requires reconsideration.",0,1497

25575224,The potential transformation of our species by neural enhancement.,['Zehr EP'],Journal of motor behavior,2015,"Neural enhancement represents recovery of function that has been lost due to injury or disease pathology. Restoration of functional ability is the objective. For example, a neuroprosthetic to replace a forearm and hand lost to the ravages of war or industrial accident. However, the same basic constructs used for neural enhancement after injury could amplify abilities that are already in the natural normal range. That is, neural enhancement technologies to restore function and improve daily abilities for independent living could be used to improve so-called normal function to ultimate function. Approaching that functional level by use and integration of technology takes us toward the concept of a new species. This new subspecies--homo sapiens technologicus--is one that uses technology not just to assist but to change its own inherent biological function. The author uses examples from prosthetics and neuroprosthetics to address the issue of the limitations of constructs on the accepted range of human performance ability and aims to provide a cautionary view toward reflection on where our science may take the entire species.",1.418,851

Do we descend from a single recent ancestral population in Africa, or from multiple ancestral populations in various regions of the world which one million years ago simultaneously began developing into H.s.sapiens? The high substitution rate of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) makes this molecule suitable for genealogical and chronological research on closely related hominoid species. We have analyzed the complete mtDNA sequences of three humans (African, European and Japanese) and two African apes (common chimpanzee and gorilla) in an attempt to estimate more accurately the substitution rates and divergence times of hominoid mtDNAs. Nonsynonymous substitutions and substitutions in RNA genes have accumulated at an approximately constant rate. Under the assumption, supported by the fossil record, that the orangutan and African apes diverged 13 million years ago, we have previously obtained 4.7 million years as the divergence time between humans and chimpanzees. Using this date, we calibrated the substitution rates at synonymous sites and in the displacement-loop region as 4.03 and 7.25 x 10(-8)/site/year, respectively. Based on these rates together with the observation that the African sequence presented here is most diverged from all other human sequences, we inferred the age of the last common ancestor of the human mtDNAs as 140,000 +/- 18,000 years. The result strongly supports the recent African origin of modern humans, H.s. sapiens.",0,1687

Beyond the classical model.,['Corballis MC'],Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2015,"Until recently it was widely held that language, and its left-hemispheric representation in the brain, were uniquely human, emerging abruptly after the emergence of Homo sapiens. Changing views of language suggest that it was not a recent and sudden development in human evolution, but was adapted from dual-stream circuity long predating hominins, including a system in nonhuman primates specialized for intentional grasping. This system was gradually tailored for skilled manual operations (praxis) and communication. As processing requirements grew more demanding, the neural circuits were increasingly lateralized, with the left hemisphere assuming dominance, at least in the majority of individuals. The trend toward complexity and lateralization was probably accelerated in hominins when bipedalism freed the hands for more complex manufacture and tool use, and more expressive communication. The incorporation of facial and vocal gestures led to the emergence of speech as the dominant mode of language, although gestural communication may have led to generative language before speech became dominant. This scenario provides a more Darwinian perspective on language and its lateralization than has been commonly assumed.",4.383,679

Using pentapeptide matching, only 214 motifs out of a total of 3,007 (7.11%) identified HCV as nonself compared to the Homo sapiens proteome. However, this virus-versus-human phenetic difference disappeared at the genetic level. Indeed, a BLAST analysis of pentadecameric oligodeoxynucleotide sequences corresponding to the 214 pentapeptides unique to HCV revealed that almost all of them are present in the human genome, located in the non-coding strand, introns, and/or pseudogenes, thus being, as such, untranslatable.

24331552,The crucial contribution of veterinarians to conservation biology.,"['Reading RP', 'Kenny DE', 'Fitzgerald KT']",Topics in companion animal medicine,2013,"Conservation biology is a relatively new (began in the 1980s), value-based discipline predicated on the belief that biological diversity-from genes to populations to species to communities to ecosystems-is good and extinction is bad. Conservation biology grew from the recognition that the Earth has entered its sixth great extinction event, one that differs from previous great extinctions in that a single species-Homo sapiens-has caused this biodiversity crisis. A diverse, interacting set of variables drive current extinctions. As such, to succeed, conservation efforts usually require broad-based, interdisciplinary approaches. Conservationists increasingly recognize the importance of contributions by veterinary science, among many other disciplines, to collaborative efforts aimed at stemming the loss of biodiversity. We argue that, to improve success rates, many wildlife conservation programs must incorporate veterinarians as part of an interdisciplinary team to assess and address problems. Ideally, veterinarians who participate in conservation would receive specialized training and be willing to work as partners as part of a larger team of experts who effectively integrate their work rather than work independently (i.e., work as interdisciplinary, as opposed to multidisciplinary, teams, respectively). In our opinion, the most successful and productive projects involve interdisciplinary teams involving both biological and nonbiological specialists. Some researchers hold multiple degrees in biology and veterinary medicine or the biological and social sciences. These experts can often offer unique insight. We see at least 3 major areas in which veterinarians can immediately offer great assistance to conservation efforts: (1) participation in wildlife capture and immobilization, (2) leadership or assistance in addressing wildlife health issues, and (3) leadership or assistance in addressing wildlife disease issues, including using wildlife as sentinels to identify new and emerging diseases or epidemics of old diseases.

ISF permits classification of a given DNA sequence as a potential insertion site or not, using a support vector machine. We have studied the genomes of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Entamoeba histolytica via a protocol whereby DNASCANNER is used to identify a common set of statistically important signals flanking the insertion sites in the various genomes. These are used in ISF for insertion site prediction, and the current accuracy of the tool is over 65%. We find similar signals at gene boundaries and splice sites.

We show that the mechanism of mitotic arrest is transient and implicates a decrease in the expression of cdc2/cdc28 kinase subunit Homo sapiens 1 (CKsHs1) and a delay in the metabolism of cyclin B. Primary human fibroblasts infected with a retroviral vector that drives the expression of a mutant p53 protein failed to downregulate CKsHs1 expression, degraded cyclin B despite the absence of chromosomal segregation, and underwent DNA endoreduplication. In addition, ectopic expression of CKsHs1 interfered with the control of cyclin B metabolism by the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint and resulted in a higher tendency to undergo DNA endoreduplication. These results demonstrate that an altered regulation of CKsHs1 and cyclin B in cells that carry mutant p53 undermines the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint and facilitates the development of aneuploidy. These data may contribute to the understanding of the origin of heteroploidy in mutant p53 cells.",4.777,370

After the Feldhofer Grotto Neanderthal disproved this creationist notion, and human-fossil hunting became legitimate, new specimens were allocated either to sapiens or new species within Homo, or even to new species within new genera. Yet as these taxonomic acts reflected the morphological differences between specimens, they failed to address the question: What constitutes H. sapiens? When in 1950 Mayr collapsed all human fossils into Homo, he not only denied humans a diverse evolutionary past, he also shifted the key to identifying its species from morphology to geological age - a practice most paleoanthropologists still follow. Thus, for example, H. erectus is the species that preceded H. sapiens, and H. sapiens is the species into which H. erectus morphed.

Here, we present a new method of reconstructing lordosis angles of extinct hominin specimens based on pelvic morphology, more specifically the orientation of the sacrum in relation to the acetabulum (pelvic incidence). Two regression models based on the correlation between pelvic incidence and lordosis angle in living hominoids have been developed. The mean values of the calculated lordosis angles based on these models are 36 degrees -45 degrees  for australopithecines, 45 degrees -47 degrees  for Homo erectus, 27 degrees -34 degrees  for the Neandertals and the Sima de los Huesos hominins, and 49 degrees -51 degrees  for fossil H. sapiens. The newly calculated lordosis values are consistent with previously published values of extinct hominins (Been et al.: Am J Phys Anthropol 147 (2012) 64-77). If the mean values of the present nonhuman hominoids are representative of the pelvic and lumbar morphology of the last common ancestor between humans and nonhuman hominoids, then both pelvic incidence and lordosis angle dramatically increased during hominin evolution from 27 degrees  +/- 5 to 22 degrees  +/- 3 (respectively) in nonhuman hominoids to 54 degrees  +/- 10 and 51 degrees  +/- 11 in modern humans. This change to a more human-like configuration appeared early in the hominin evolution as the pelvis and spines of both australopithecines and H. erectus show a higher pelvic incidence and lordosis angle than nonhuman hominoids. The Sima de los Huesos hominins and Neandertals show a derived configuration with a low pelvic incidence and lordosis angle.",2.379,1434

Genetic loss of PHGDH is toxic toward PHGDH-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines even in the presence of exogenous serine. Here, we used a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify small-molecule PHGDH inhibitors. These compounds reduce the production of glucose-derived serine in cells and suppress the growth of PHGDH-dependent cancer cells in culture and in orthotopic xenograft tumors. Surprisingly, PHGDH inhibition reduced the incorporation into nucleotides of one-carbon units from glucose-derived and exogenous serine. We conclude that glycolytic serine synthesis coordinates the use of one-carbon units from endogenous and exogenous serine in nucleotide synthesis, and we suggest that one-carbon unit wasting thus may contribute to the efficacy of PHGDH inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.",12.996,648

For this reason, and because of purported co-evolutionary links between this trait and language capabilities in modern humans, the identification of hand preference in the hominin fossil record has long been of interest to researchers studying the evolution of 'handedness' within the genus Homo. Identifying hand preference in skeletal samples, however, is not straightforward. Problems arise from difficulties in determining the precise nature of the relationship between hand use and bone morphology, the methods by which hand preference is assessed, the paucity of material available for study, and even what is meant by the term 'handedness'. Various attempts have been made to address these issues, encompassing a range of methodological approaches, such as comparisons of osteological techniques, studies of prehistoric material culture and ethnographic analysis of hand use behaviours in modern hunter-gatherer societies and non-human primate groups. What such research suggests is that hand preference is a complex phenomenon, in both extant and extinct groups, and in order to assess its expression in extinct populations care must be paid to the questions asked of the available material and the methodologies used to answer them.",1.273,1885

Unlike language, face processing is an ability shared with chimpanzees and, as Darwin observed, the widespread use of facial expressions in animal communication suggests a biological basis. We tested the principle that minicolumn asymmetry follows typical functional dominance in humans, and tested its evolutionary continuity, by measuring minicolumn width, neuronal size and density in the mid-fusiform cortex in 14 humans and 14 chimpanzees. We found that microanatomical asymmetry distinguishes humans from chimpanzees although the direction of asymmetry is the same as in language areas-the right hemisphere contained narrower minicolumns and smaller pyramidal neurons, as in auditory language areas. Uniformly narrow minicolumns in chimpanzees and in the human right hemisphere are consistent with mechanistic predictions supporting the apparent bias towards holistic face processing. Wider minicolumns and larger neurons in the human left hemisphere may be consistent with a language function such as word-form processing. Microanatomical asymmetry in the neocortex therefore provides a correlate of hemispheric specialisation.",5.618,91

Using quantitative data on several lithic techno-typological attributes, we demonstrate that there is a significant degree of variability in the Early Ahmarian between the northern and southern Levant, as previously pointed out by several researchers. In addition, we suggest that the technology similar to the southern Early Ahmarian also existed in the northern Levant, i.e., the Ksar Akil Phase 4 group (the KA 4 group), by introducing new Upper Palaeolithic assemblages from Wadi Kharar 16R, inland Syria. We then review currently available stratigraphic records and radiocarbon dates (including a new date from Wadi Kharar 16R), with special attention to their methodological background. As a result, we propose alternative chronological scenarios, including one that postulates that the southern Early Ahmarian and the KA 4 group appeared later than the northern Early Ahmarian with little or no overlap. On the basis of the alternative scenarios of chronological/geographical patterns of the Early Ahmarian variability, we propose four possible relationships between the Protoaurignacian and the Early Ahmarian, including a new scenario that the appearance of the Protoaurignacian preceded those of similar technological entities in the Levant, i.e., the southern Early Ahmarian and the KA 4 group. If the last hypothesis is substantiated, it requires us to reconsider the model of a Levantine origin of the Protoaurignacian and its palaeoanthropological implications.",3.733,268

The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes.",3.733,1487

This communication can occur only because we share a similar human nature. Therefore, the philosophies that deny human nature, as well as those that reduce the human being to mere nature, do not serve as a basis for a common bioethics, but will probably lead to the fragmentation of the bioethics. Consequently, here I will argue in favour of a concept of human nature that integrates the biological, social and spiritual aspects of human being.

Hominin evolution occurred in the proximity of East-African freshwater lakes and rivers and early homo sapiens had higher intakes of AA and DHA from a predominantly lacustrine-based diet. In search of milk AA and DHA contents of our African ancestors, we investigated the milk of 29 lactating women living in Doromoni near lake Kitangiri (Tanzania). They consumed sunflower oil-fried local fish as only animal lipid sources, maize and local vegetables. AA and DHA contents of Doromoni milk may be close to that of early homo sapiens, because of the similarity of their life-long consumption of East-African lacustrine-based foods. Human milk fatty acid relationships from our historical worldwide database and the literature revealed that disparities between the Doromoni diet and the presumed ancient diet (i.e. higher carbohydrate and linoleic acid intakes) are unlikely to affect milk AA and DHA contents. Doromoni milk had high contents of AA (median 0.70 mol%), DHA (0.75) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 0.17), and low AA/DHA ratios (median 0.91; 0.55-2.61). This tracks down to consumption of fish with high AA and DHA contents, and AA/EPA ratios. We conclude that the milk AA, DHA and EPA contents of Doromoni women might provide us with clues to optimize infant formulae and perhaps the milk of Western women.",2.346,1735
19384865,Ritualized combat as an indicator of intrasexual selection effects on male life history evolution.,['Graves BM'],"American journal of human biology : the official journal of
 the Human Biology Council",2010,"Trade-offs between survival, growth, current reproduction, and future reproduction influence life history evolution, leading to adaptive timing of investment in various strategies. If engagement in costly intrasexual contests to gain better access to mates is an important form of male reproductive investment, then the expression of characters that promote success in this process should be influenced by their fitness effects across the lifespan. To test this prediction, the ages at which human (Homo sapiens) males exhibit the greatest investment in morphological, behavioral, and physiological characters associated with intrasexual competition was estimated by examining the ages at which males succeed in a form of ritualized combat. The average age of international boxing champions was in the latter half of the twenties, and titles were held for about 2 years on average. Thus, peak investment in traits that enhance intrasexual competition abilities appears to coincide with ages at which males have highest reproductive success. Additionally, larger males reached peak probability of success in this ritualized combat at ages about 2.6 years greater than smaller males. Because body size is highly heritable and there is strong positive assortative mating relative to this character among humans, this may indicate a polymorphic set of reproductive strategies produced through maintenance of coadapted gene complexes.",1.204,1848

Their unique sequence features, i.e., a tripartite structure, six transmembrane alpha-helices and a three-fold repeated signature motif, allow MCs to be easily recognized. This review describes how the functions of MCs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana (listed in the first table) were discovered after the genome sequence of S. cerevisiae was determined in 1996. In the genomic era, more than 50 previously unknown MCs from these organisms have been identified and characterized biochemically using a method consisting of gene expression, purification of the recombinant proteins, their reconstitution into liposomes and transport assays (EPRA). Information derived from studies with intact mitochondria, genetic and metabolic evidence, sequence similarity, phylogenetic analysis and complementation of knockout phenotypes have guided the choice of substrates that were tested in the transport assays.

The oxidative stress-associated Src activator/Homo sapiens chromosome 9 open reading frame 10 protein (Ossa/C9orf10) protects cancer cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by Src family kinases activation. METHODS: In this study precursor of protoporphyrin IX, 5-aminolevulinic acid and its encapsulated form were used in treating MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. After light illumination, cells were collected at different time points and used for evaluation (immunocytochemistry, Western blot analysis) of expression of above proteins, c-Src and Ossa. RESULTS: Our results showed that 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy caused decrease of c-Src expression at 7h after irradiation. The strongest expression was observed at 24h after treatment. Encapsulated form of 5-aminolevulinic acid in terms of PDT caused similar changes of expression of c-Src protein.

To date, six forms are recognized on the effects of different melanogenesis genes. OCA4 is caused by mutations in SLC45A2 showing a heterogeneous phenotype ranging from white hair, blue irides and nystagmus to brown/black hair, brown irides and no nystagmus. The high clinic variety often leads to misdiagnosis. Our aim is to contribute to OCA4 diagnosis defining SLC45A2 genetic variants in Italian patients with OCA without any TYR, OCA2 and TYRP1 gene defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the clinical diagnosis of OCA, all patients received genetic counseling and genetic test. Automatic sequencing of TYR, OCA2, and TYRP1 genes was performed on DNA of 117 albino patients. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) was carried out on TYR and OCA2 genes to increase the mutation rate. SLC45A2 gene sequencing was then executed in the patients with a single mutation in one of the TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 genes and in the patients, which resulted negative at the screening of these genes. RESULTS: SLC45A2 gene analysis was performed in 41 patients and gene alterations were found in 5 patients. Four previously reported SLC45A2 mutations were found: p.G100S, p.W202C, p.A511E and c.986delC, and three novel variants were identified: p.M265L, p.H94D, and c.1156+1G>A.

This is one unanswered question facing the rapidly growing number of researchers studying non-model species. Using Homo sapiens data and resources, we compared the direct mapping of sequencing reads to predicted genes from the genome with mapping to de novo transcriptomes assembled from RNA-Seq data. Gene coverage and expression analysis was further investigated in the non-model context by using increasingly divergent genomic reference species to group assembled contigs by unique genes. RESULTS: Eight transcriptome sets, composed of varying amounts of Illumina and 454 data, were assembled and assessed. Hybrid 454/Illumina assemblies had the highest transcriptome and individual gene coverage. Quantitative whole gene expression levels were highly similar between using a de novo hybrid assembly and the predicted genes as a scaffold, although mapping to the de novo transcriptome assembly provided data on fewer genes. Using non-target species as reference scaffolds does result in some loss of sequence and expression data, and bias and error increase with evolutionary distance. However, within a 100 million year window these effect sizes are relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: Predicted gene sets from sequenced genomes of related species can provide a powerful method for grouping RNA-Seq reads and annotating contigs. Gene expression results can be produced that are similar to results obtained using gene models derived from a high quality genome, though biased towards conserved genes.

Repairing mismatches in heteroduplexes often leads to single nucleotide substitutions in a process known as gene conversion. Gene conversion was shown to be GC-biased in different organisms; that is, a W(A or T)-->S(G or C) substitution is more likely in this process than a S-->W substitution. Here, we show that the insertion/deletion ratio for short noncoding indels that reach fixation between species is positively correlated with the recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This correlation is both due to an increase of the fixation rate of insertions and decrease of the fixation rate of deletions in regions of high recombination. Whole-genome data on indel polymorphism and divergence in D. melanogaster rule out mutation biases and selection as the cause of this trend, pointing to insertion-biased gene conversion as the most likely explanation. The bias toward insertions is the strongest for single-nucleotide indels, and decreases with indel length. In regions of high recombination rate this bias leads to an up to  approximately 5-fold excess of fixed short insertions over deletions, and substantially affects the evolution of DNA segments.",0,1062
21143798,Probing the anticancer mechanism of prospective herbal drug Withaferin A on mammals: a case study on human and bovine proteasomes.,"['Grover A', 'Shandilya A', 'Bisaria VS', 'Sundar D']",BMC genomics,2010,"BACKGROUND: The UPP (ubiquitin proteasome pathway) is the major proteolytic system in the cytosol and nucleus of all eukaryotic cells which regulates cellular events, including mitotis, differentiation, signal transduction, apoptosis, and inflammation. UPP controls activation of the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB), which is a regulatory protein playing central role in a variety of cellular processes including immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Since the primary interaction of proteasomes occurs with endogenous proteins, the signalling action of transcription factor NF-kappaB can be blocked by inhibition of proteasomes. A great variety of natural and synthetic chemical compounds classified as peptide aldehydes, peptide boronates, nonpeptide inhibitors, peptide vinyl sulfones and epoxyketones are now widely used as research tools for probing their potential to inhibit proteolytic activities of different proteasomes and to investigate the underlying inhibition mechanisms. The present work reports a bio-computational study carried out with the aim of exploring the proteasome inhibition capability of WA (withaferin A), a steroidal lactone, by understanding the binding mode of WA as a ligand into the mammalian proteasomes (X-ray crystal structure of Bos taurus 20S proteasome and multiple template homology modelled structure of 20S proteasome of Homo sapiens) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies. RESULTS: One possible mode of action which is proposed here for WA to act as a proteasome inhibitor is by suppression of the proteolytic activity which depends on the N-terminal threonine (Thr1) residue hydroxyl group. Docking studies carried out with herbal ligand WA into the structures of bovine and human proteasomes substantiate that WA has the ability to inhibit activity of mammalian 20S proteasomes by blocking the nucleophilic function of N-terminal Thr1. Results from molecular dynamics simulations in water show that the trajectories of both the native human 20S proteasome and the proteasome complexed with WA are stable over a considerably long time period of 4 ns suggesting the dynamic structural stability of human 20S proteasome/WA complex. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of proteasomal activity are promising ways to retard or block degradation of specific proteins to correct diverse pathologies. Though quite a number of selective and efficient proteasomal inhibitors exist nowadays, their toxic side effects limit their potential in possible disease treatment. Thus there is an indispensable need for exploration of novel natural products as antitumor drug candidates. The present work supports the mammalian proteasomes inhibiting activity of WA along with elucidation of its possible mode of action. Since WA is a small herbal molecule, it is expected to provide one of the modest modes of inhibition along with added favours of ease in oral administration and decreased immunogenicity. The molecular docking results suggest that WA can inhibit the mammalian proteasomes irreversibly and with a high rate through acylation of the N-terminal Thr1 of the beta-5 subunit.",3.986,1598

Among the genes involved in this process are cell adhesion molecules, such as protocadherins and neuroligins, which are essential factors for the identification of the appropriate partner cell and the formation of synapses. In this work, we studied the expression and the genetic variability of two closely related members of the protocadherin family PCDH11X/Y, located on the X and the Y chromosome, respectively. PCDH11Y is one of the rare genes specific to the hominoid lineage, being absent in other primates. Expression analysis indicated that transcripts of the PCDH11X/Y genes are mainly detected in the cortex of the human brain. Mutation screening of 30 individuals with autism identified two PCDH11Y polymorphic amino acid changes, F885V and K980N. These variations are in complete association, appeared during human evolution approximately 40,000 years ago and represent informative polymorphisms to study Y chromosome variability in populations. We studied the frequency of these variants in males with autism spectrum disorders (n = 110), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 61), bipolar disorder (n = 61), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 51), or schizophrenia (n = 61) and observed no significant differences when compared to ethnically-matched control populations. These findings do not support the role of PCDH11Y, or more generally of a frequent specific Y chromosome, in the susceptibility to these neuropsychiatric disorders.",1.204,526

Yet, there is little known about variation in molar root morphology in Neanderthals and other recent and fossil members of Homo. Here, we provide the first comprehensive metric analysis of permanent mandibular molar root morphology in Middle and Late Pleistocene Homo neanderthalensis, and Late Pleistocene (Aterian) and recent Homo sapiens. We specifically address the question of whether root form can be used to distinguish between these groups and assess whether any variation in root form can be related to differences in tooth function. We apply a microtomographic imaging approach to visualise and quantify the external and internal dental morphologies of both isolated molars and molars embedded in the mandible (n=127). Univariate and multivariate analyses reveal both similarities (root length and pulp volume) and differences (occurrence of pyramidal roots and dental tissue volume proportion) in molar root morphology among penecontemporaneous Neanderthals and Aterian H. sapiens. In contrast, the molars of recent H. sapiens are markedly smaller than both Pleistocene H. sapiens and Neanderthals, but share with the former the dentine volume reduction and a smaller root-to-crown volume compared with Neanderthals. Furthermore, we found the first molar to have the largest average root surface area in recent H. sapiens and Neanderthals, although in the latter the difference between M(1) and M(2) is small. In contrast, Aterian H. sapiens root surface areas peak at M(2). Since root surface area is linked to masticatory function, this suggests a distinct occlusal loading regime in Neanderthals compared with both recent and Pleistocene H. sapiens.",3.733,155

Epiphyseal closure defines bone growth and signals a mature skeleton. Most of what we know about timing of development in chimpanzees derives from dental studies on Pan troglodytes. Much less is known about the sister species, Pan paniscus, with few in captivity and a wild range restricted to central Africa. Here, we report on the timing of skeletal fusion for female captive P. paniscus (n = 5) whose known ages range from 0.83 to age 11.68 years. Observations on the skeletons were made after the individuals were dissected and bones cleaned. Comparisons with 10 female captive P. troglodytes confirm a generally uniform pattern in the sequence of skeletal fusion in the two captive species. We also compared the P. paniscus to a sample of three unknown-aged female wild P. paniscus, and 10 female wild P. troglodytes of known age from the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. The sequence of teeth emergence to bone fusion is generally consistent between the two species, with slight variations in late juvenile and subadult stages. The direct-age comparisons show that skeletal growth in captive P. paniscus is accelerated compared with both captive and wild P. troglodytes populations. The skeletal data combined with dental stages have implications for estimating the life stage of immature skeletal materials of wild P. paniscus and for more broadly comparing the skeletal growth rates among captive and wild chimpanzees (Pan), Homo sapiens, and fossil hominins.",2.379,1411

We generated high- and low-speed chimeric myosin XI by replacing the motor domains of Arabidopsis thaliana myosin XI-2 with those of Chara corallina myosin XI and Homo sapiens myosin Vb, respectively. Surprisingly, the plant sizes of the transgenic Arabidopsis expressing high- and low-speed chimeric myosin XI-2 were larger and smaller, respectively, than that of the wild-type plant. This size change correlated with acceleration and deceleration, respectively, of cytoplasmic streaming. Our results strongly suggest that cytoplasmic streaming is a key determinant of plant size.

In this work, the comparative study of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 PR enzymes through sequence and structural analysis is reported along with approved drugs of HIV-PR. Conformation of each HIV PR drugs have been examined with different parameters of interactions and energy scorings parameters. MD simulations with respect to timescale event of 20 ns favors that, few HIV-PR inhibitors can be more active inside the HTLV-1 PR binding pocket. Overall results suggest that, some of HIV inhibitors like Tipranavir, Indinavir, Darunavir and Amprenavir are having good energy levels with HTLV-1.

Besides, the coding sequence of dairy goats NSE gene was cloned and its biological information was analyzed. Results revealed that NSE immunopositive cells exhibited widespread cytoplasmic staining throughout the whole pregnant CL. In addition, these cells showed typical characteristics of DNES cells in the electron microscopy. These results suggested that many DNES cells exist in the pregnant CL of dairy goats. Meanwhile, we identified the coding sequence of dairy goats NSE (GenBank Accession No. JN887466). Its nucleotide sequence homology was found to be 97.9%, 89.3%, 90% and 92.6%, respectively, compared with that of Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, while the amino acid sequence homology was 99.1%, 97%, 97.2% and 98.2% respectively. These results first showed that the functional amino acids coded by the NSE gene were highly conserved in Caprine, B. taurus, R. norvegicus, M. musculus and H. sapiens. It was implied that the gene NSE in dairy goats had close homology to that of NSE of other species. Our findings demonstrated the possible existence of DNES cells in pregnant CL, providing new clue for further understanding of interactions between the neuroendocrine and reproductive systems.

It has also been shown to be common in the model seed plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). In one of the first studies involving sequence-based prediction of AS in plants, we performed a genome-wide identification and characterization of NAGNAG AS in the model plant Physcomitrella patens, a moss. RESULTS: Using Sanger data, we found 295 alternatively used NAGNAG acceptors in P. patens. Using 31 features and training and test datasets of constitutive and alternative NAGNAGs, we trained a classifier to predict the splicing outcome at NAGNAG tandem splice sites (alternative splicing, constitutive at the first acceptor, or constitutive at the second acceptor). Our classifier achieved a balanced specificity and sensitivity of >or= 89%. Subsequently, a classifier trained exclusively on data well supported by transcript evidence was used to make genome-wide predictions of NAGNAG splicing outcomes. By generation of more transcript evidence from a next-generation sequencing platform (Roche 454), we found additional evidence for NAGNAG AS, with altogether 664 alternative NAGNAGs being detected in P. patens using all currently available transcript evidence. The 454 data also enabled us to validate the predictions of the classifier, with 64% (80/125) of the well-supported cases of AS being predicted correctly. CONCLUSION: NAGNAG AS is just as common in the moss P. patens as it is in the seed plants A. thaliana and O. sativa (but not conserved on the level of orthologous introns), and can be predicted with high accuracy. The most informative features are the nucleotides in the NAGNAG and in its immediate vicinity, along with the splice sites scores, as found earlier for NAGNAG AS in animals. Our results suggest that the mechanism behind NAGNAG AS in plants is similar to that in animals and is largely dependent on the splice site and its immediate neighborhood.",3.813,1776

The homodimeric enzyme is catalytically active only as a dimer. Interestingly, significant differences exist between the human and parasite TIMs interfaces with a sequence identity of 52%. Therefore, compounds able to specifically disrupt TcTIM but not Homo sapiens TIM (hTIM) dimer interface could become selective antichagasic drugs. In the present work, the binding modes of 1,2,4-thiadiazol, phenazine and 1,2,6-thiadiazine derivatives to TcTIM were investigated using molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results show that phenazine and 1,2,6-thiadiazine derivatives, 2 and 3, act as dimer-disrupting inhibitors of TcTIM having also allosteric effects in the conformation of the active site. On the other hand, the 1,2,4-thiadiazol derivative 1 binds into the active site causing a significant decrease in enzyme mobility in both monomers. The loss of conformational flexibility upon compound 1 binding suggests that this inhibitor could be preventing essential motions of the enzyme required for optimal activity. The lack of inhibitory activity of 1 against hTIM was also investigated and seems to be related with the high mobility of hTIM which would hinder the formation of a stable ligand-enzyme complex. This work has contributed to understand the mechanism of action of this kind of inhibitors and could result of great help for future rational novel drug design.",1.722,865

It seems that they were the main engine responsible for the integration of different mutations favorable for the environmental conditions. In cooperation with different transcription factors and other biochemical components, these regulatory regions dictate the synthesis frequency of RNA molecules. Predominantly in the last decade, it has become clear that nuclear organization impacts upon gene regulation. To fully understand the connections between Homo sapiens chromosomes and their gene promoters, we analyzed 1200 promoter sequences using our Kappa Index of Coincidence method. RESULTS: In order to measure the structural similarity of gene promoters, we used two-dimensional image-based patterns obtained through Kappa Index of Coincidence (Kappa IC) and (C+G)% values. The center of weight of each promoter pattern indicated a structure similarity between promoters of each chromosome. Furthermore, the proximity of chromosomes seems to be in accordance to the structural similarity of their gene promoters. The arrangement of chromosomes according to Kappa IC values of promoters, shows a striking symmetry between the chromosome length and the structure of promoters located on them. High Kappa IC and (C+G)% values of gene promoters were also directly associated with the most frequent genetic diseases. Taking into consideration these observations, a general hypothesis for the evolutionary dynamics of the genome has been proposed. In this hypothesis, heterochromatin and euchromatin domains exchange DNA sequences according to a difference in the rate of Slipped Strand Mispairing and point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper we showed that gene promoters appear to be specific to each chromosome. Furthermore, the proximity between chromosomes seems to be in accordance to the structural similarity of their gene promoters.

Additionally, significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for 10 traits from the three developmental components (basicranium, splanchnocranium, and neurocranium) of the craniofacial complex. These QTL were found on chromosomes 3, 6, 11, 12, and 14. This study of the genetic architecture of the craniofacial complex elucidates fundamental information of the genetic architecture of the craniofacial complex in humans.",1.542,169

First, amino acid sequences of the leptin protein from Homo sapiens (human, P41159), Sus scrofa (wild pig, Q29406), Felis catus (domestic cat, Q29406), Rattus norvegicus (rat, P50596), and Mus musculus (mouse, P41160) were randomly searched in the high-quality annotated and non-redundant protein sequence database UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. A dendogram showing the evolutionary relationships among specimens was constructed from the sequences of interest using the Mega 6.0 software with the neighbor-joining method. The resulting tree presenting the evolutionary relationships among specimens inferred from amino acid sequences of the leptin protein in mammals demonstrated 2 main branches: 1 cluster including the rat and mouse species (0.02) and a second cluster containing both wild pig and domestic cat species grouped in a sub-branch (0.04 and 0.06, respectively), linking them to the human sequence (0.08). These findings were reinforced by comparing estimates of evolutionary divergence among leptin sequences analyzed. Based on comparative analyses of multiple sequence alignments in the present study, there was a stronger conservation degree of the leptin protein in evolutionarily close species and several conservative changes along the sequences of interest, revealing information regarding the evolutionary biology among mammals.",0.775,839

Besides being deeply rooted in how we experience music, research suggests consonant intervals are more easily processed than dissonant intervals. In the present work we explore from a comparative perspective if such processing advantage extends to more complex tasks such as the detection of abstract rules. We ran experiments on rule learning over consonant and dissonant intervals with nonhuman animals and human participants. Results show differences across species regarding the extent to which they benefit from differences in consonance. Animals learn abstract rules with the same ease independently of whether they are implemented over consonant intervals (Experiment 1), dissonant intervals (Experiment 2), or over a combination of them (Experiment 3). Humans, on the contrary, learn an abstract rule better when it is implemented over consonant (Experiment 4) than over dissonant intervals (Experiment 5). Moreover, their performance improves when there is a mapping between abstract categories defining a rule and consonant and dissonant intervals (Experiments 6 and 7). Results suggest that for humans, consonance might be used as a perceptual anchor for other cognitive processes as to facilitate the detection of abstract patterns. Lacking extensive experience with harmonic stimuli, nonhuman animals tested here do not seem to benefit from a processing advantage for consonant intervals. (PsycINFO Database Record",1.52,27
22321512,Molecular evidence of host influences on the evolution and spread of human tapeworms.,"['Michelet L', 'Dauga C']",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,2012,"The taeniasis/cysticercosis complex is included in the list of neglected zoonotic diseases by the World Health Organization due to its significant impact on public health in tropical areas. Cysticercosis is still endemic in many regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Long absent in Europe and in other developed countries, cysticercosis has recently re-emerged in the United States and Canada, due to immigration, travel and local transmission. This has encouraged the use of molecular data to understand better the influence of animal and human hosts on the emergence and spread of Taenia species. The increasing number of mitochondrial sequences now available from human tapeworms and recent advances in computational tools has enabled reconstruction of the biogeography and evolutionary history of these organisms. New molecular data have provided insights into the biogeography of T. solium, T. asiatica and T. saginata. A Bayesian statistical framework using variable evolutionary rates from lineage to lineage has allowed an improved timescale analysis of human tapeworms. The dates of divergence obtained were compared to the timing of evolutionary events in the history of their hosts, based on the hypothesis that Taenia spp. and their hosts share a common history. Herein, we review changes in the definitive and secondary hosts and human interactions that underlie the differentiation and evolution of tapeworms. Species diversification of Taenia seems to be closely linked with the evolution of intermediate hosts in response to climatic events during the Pleistocene. Different genotypes of T. solium emerged when European and Asian wild boar Sus spp. populations diverged. Taenia saginata emerged when wild cattle Bos primigenius evolved and when zebu Bos indicus and taurine Bos taurus ancestors separated. Humans through migrations and later with the development of farming and animal husbandry may have had a significant impact on the spread and diversification of tapeworms. Migrations of Homo erectus from Africa to Asia and later of Homo sapiens facilitated the diversification and dispersal of T. solium and T. saginata populations. The development of animal husbandry, making Sus scrofa and Bos taurus preferential intermediate hosts, led to the worldwide distribution of parasites. New molecular data combined with an innovative dating method allow us to explain the ways in which ancient human migrations promoted the emergence and spread of taeniasis and cysticercosis around the world. Another intriguing phenomenon explained better by our approach is the influence of human settlement on the spread of these parasites in recently inhabited areas. The diverse nature of T. solium currently observed in Madagascar may correspond to multiple imports of the parasite during Austronesian migrations, while in Mexico a recent influence of humans during the colonial period is more likely. Human activities, especially food preparation and husbandry methods, remain responsible for the transmission and persistence of these parasites.",1.427,1178

 of reports on genes and genomes",2012,"Nucleosomes are the basic structural units of eukaryotic chromatin and play a key role in the regulation of gene expression. Nucleosome formation depends on several factors, including properties of the sequence itself, but also physical constraints and epigenetic factors such as chromatin-remodelling enzymes. In this view, a sequence-dependent approach is able to capture a general tendency of a region to bind a histone octamer. A reference data set of positioned nucleosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to study the role of DNA helical rise in histone-DNA interaction. Genomic sequences were transformed into arrays of helical rise values by a tetranucleotide code and then turned into profiles of mean helical rise values. These profiles resemble maps of nucleosome occupancy, suggesting that intrinsic histone-DNA interactions are linked to helical rise. The obtained results show that preferential nucleosome occupancy occurs where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values. Mean helical rise profiles obtained by using maps of positioned nucleosomes of the Drosophila melanogaster and Plasmodium falciparum genomes, as well as Homo sapiens chromosome 20 confirm that nucleosomes are mainly located where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values.",0,1396
24581555,A comprehensive evaluation of assembly scaffolding tools.,[],Genome biology,2014,"BACKGROUND: Genome assembly is typically a two-stage process: contig assembly followed by the use of paired sequencing reads to join contigs into scaffolds. Scaffolds are usually the focus of reported assembly statistics; longer scaffolds greatly facilitate the use of genome sequences in downstream analyses, and it is appealing to present larger numbers as metrics of assembly performance. However, scaffolds are highly prone to errors, especially when generated using short reads, which can directly result in inflated assembly statistics. RESULTS: Here we provide the first independent evaluation of scaffolding tools for second-generation sequencing data. We find large variations in the quality of results depending on the tool and dataset used. Even extremely simple test cases of perfect input, constructed to elucidate the behaviour of each algorithm, produced some surprising results. We further dissect the performance of the scaffolders using real and simulated sequencing data derived from the genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens. The results from simulated data are of high quality, with several of the tools producing perfect output. However, at least 10% of joins remains unidentified when using real data. CONCLUSIONS: The scaffolders vary in their usability, speed and number of correct and missed joins made between contigs. Results from real data highlight opportunities for further improvements of the tools. Overall, SGA, SOPRA and SSPACE generally outperform the other tools on our datasets. However, the quality of the results is highly dependent on the read mapper and genome complexity.",10.81,978

 Series B, Biological sciences",2011,"Crucial questions in the debate on the origin of quintessential human behaviours are whether modern cognition and associated innovations are unique to our species and whether they emerged abruptly, gradually or as the result of a discontinuous process. Three scenarios have been proposed to account for the origin of cultural modernity. The first argues that modern cognition is unique to our species and the consequence of a genetic mutation that took place approximately 50 ka in Africa among already evolved anatomically modern humans. The second posits that cultural modernity emerged gradually in Africa starting at least 200 ka in concert with the origin of our species on that continent. The third states that innovations indicative of modern cognition are not restricted to our species and appear and disappear in Africa and Eurasia between 200 and 40 ka before becoming fully consolidated. We evaluate these scenarios in the light of new evidence from Africa, Asia and Europe and explore the mechanisms that may have led to modern cultures. Such reflections will demonstrate the need for further inquiry into the relationship between climate and demographic/cultural change in order to better understand the mechanisms of cultural transmission at work in Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens populations.",2.147,1527

The objective of this study was to identify sand fly bloodmeals in the mixed leishmaniasis focus of the department of Sucre, northern Colombia. In all 141 engorged female sand flies were analyzed, after being captured in intradomiciliary, peridomiciliary and extradomiciliary habitats with Shannon and CDC traps and by active searching in diurnal resting sites. Bloodmeals were identified by sequencing and analysis of a 358bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b (CYB) and a 330bp fragment of the nuclear gene prepronociceptin (PNOC). Using both genes 105 vertebrate bloodmeals were identified, with an efficiency of 72% for CYB but only 7% for PNOC. Ten species of vertebrates were identified as providing bloodmeal sources for 8 sand fly species: Homo sapiens (Lutzomyia evansi, Lutzomyia panamensis, Lutzomyia micropyga, Lutzomyia shannoni and Lutzomyia atroclavata), Equus caballus (L. evansi, L. panamensis and Lutzomyia cayennensis cayennensis), Equus asinus (L. evansi and L. panamensis), Bos taurus (L. evansi, L. panamensis and L. c. cayennensis), Tamandua mexicana (L. shannoni and Lutzomyia trinidadensis), Proechimys guyanensis (L. evansi, L. panamensis and L. c. cayennensis), Mabuya sp.

Exon shuffling, intron-mediated recombination of exons from existing genes, is known to have been a major mechanism of domain shuffling in metazoans. Thus, we hypothesized that exon shuffling could have a significant influence in shaping the topology of PPI networks. RESULTS: We tested our hypothesis by compiling exon shuffling and PPI data from six eukaryotic species: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Arabidopsis thaliana. For all four metazoan species, genes enriched in exon shuffling events presented on average higher vertex degree (number of interacting partners) in PPI networks. Furthermore, we verified that a set of protein domains that are simultaneously promiscuous (known to interact to multiple types of other domains), self-interacting (able to interact with another copy of themselves) and abundant in the genomes presents a stronger signal for exon shuffling. CONCLUSIONS: Exon shuffling appears to have been a recurrent mechanism for the emergence of new PPIs along metazoan evolution. In metazoan genomes, exon shuffling also promoted the expansion of some protein domains. We speculate that their promiscuous and self-interacting properties may have been decisive for that expansion.",3.986,1597

Other subsamples of H. erectus (African, Chinese, and Indonesian) do not appear to increase significantly through time. Regression results generally corroborate results of the test for trend.

The expression of differentially regulated key genes was confirmed with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in post-silenced RB cell lines (Y79 and WERI Rb1). These deregulated genes were compared for their constitutive expression in primary RB tumors (n=10). Zymographic determination of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was performed in RB cells. A cell cycle assay and a proliferation assay were performed in post-transfected RB cells. RESULTS: HMGA2 gene silencing in cultured RB cells results in reduced cell proliferation and transition in the G1/S phase. The whole genome microarray analysis of HMGA2 silenced Y79 cells revealed overall upregulation of 1,132 genes (>/= 1.0 fold) and downregulation of 1,562 genes (</= -1.0 fold).

A close analysis of abnormal phenotypes can give clues into how sequence variations in regulatory genes and changes in transcriptional control may give rise to characteristics defined as complex traits.",0,534

While several tools have been developed for high-throughput mapping of longer mRNA-seq reads (>30 nt), there are few that are specifically designed for mapping of smRNA reads including microRNAs. The accuracy of these mappers has not been systematically determined in the case of smRNA-seq. In addition, it is unknown whether these aligners accurately map smRNA reads containing sequence errors and polymorphisms. By using simulated read sets, we determine the alignment sensitivity and accuracy of 16 short-read mappers and quantify their robustness to mismatches, indels, and nontemplated nucleotide additions. These were explored in the context of a plant genome (Oryza sativa,  approximately 500 Mbp) and a mammalian genome (Homo sapiens,  approximately 3.1 Gbp). Analysis of simulated and real smRNA-seq data demonstrates that mapper selection impacts differential expression results and interpretation. These results will inform on best practice for smRNA mapping and enable more accurate smRNA detection and quantification of expression and RNA editing.",0,614

Here ten new NAM-thiazoline derivatives were synthesized and subsequently characterized by NMR and HRMS. A preliminary bioassay showed that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited obvious selective inhibition against human O-GlcNAcase over human beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase. Among the compounds tested, compound 7d (IC50 = 6.4 microM, hOGA; IC50>1 mM, hHex) and 7f (IC50 = 11.9 microM, hOGA; IC50>1 mM, hHex) proved to be a highly selective and potent inhibitor.

Although originally identified and annotated as putative endopeptidases, a proteolytic activity could not be confirmed for these proteins. Our survey of genome databases revealed that all eukaryotic organisms contain two GCP genes [called GCP1 and GCP2/Kae1 (kinase-associated endopeptidase 1)], whereas prokaryotes have only one, either of the GCP1- (Bacteria) or the GCP2/Kae1- (Archaea) type. GCP2/Kae1 is essential for telomere elongation and transcription of essential genes, although little is known about the localization, expression and physiological role of GCP1. In the present study on GCP1-type proteins from eukaryotic organisms we demonstrated that GCP1 is a mitochondrial protein in Homo sapiens [called here GCP1/OSGEPL1 (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase)] and Arabidopsis thaliana, which is located/anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Analysis of mRNA and protein levels revealed that the expression of GCP1/OSGEPL1 in A. thaliana and H. sapiens is tissue- and organ-specific and depends on the developmental stage, suggesting a more specialized function for this protein. We showed that homozygous A. thaliana GCP1 T-DNA (transferred DNA) insertion lines were embryonic lethal. Embryos in homozygous seeds were arrested at the globular stage and failed to undergo the transition into the heart stage. On the basis of these data we propose that the mitochondrial GCP1 is essential for embryonic development in plants.",0,1852

However, the mechanism defining its substrate affinity remains unclear. Sequence comparisons of various dUTPases revealed that Arabidopsis thaliana dUTPase has a unique tryptophan at position 93, which potentially contributes to its degree of substrate affinity. To better understand the roles of tryptophan 93, A. thaliana dUTPase was studied. RESULTS: Enzyme assays showed that A. thaliana dUTPase belongs to a high-affinity group of isozymes, which also includes the enzymes from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Enzymes from Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are grouped as low-affinity dUTPases. The structure of the homo-trimeric A. thaliana dUTPase showed three active sites, each with a different set of ligand interactions between the amino acids and water molecules. On an alpha-helix, tryptophan 93 appears to keep serine 89 in place via a water molecule and to specifically direct the ligand. Upon being oriented in the active site, the C-terminal residues close the active site to promote the reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In the high-affinity group, the prefixed direction of the serine residues was oriented by a positively charged residue located four amino acids away, while low-affinity enzymes possess small hydrophobic residues at the corresponding sites.",0,617

Beyond the role in pathology, members of this protein family are synaptic proteins and have been associated with synaptogenesis, neuronal plasticity and memory, both in vertebrates and in invertebrates. Consolidation is necessary to convert a short-term labile memory to a long-term and stable form. During consolidation, gene expression and de novo protein synthesis are regulated in order to produce key proteins for the maintenance of plastic changes produced during the acquisition of new information. RESULTS: Here we partially cloned and sequenced the beta-amyloid precursor protein like gene homologue in the crab Chasmagnathus (cappl), showing a 37% of identity with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster homologue and 23% with Homo sapiens but with much higher degree of sequence similarity in certain regions. We observed a wide distribution of cappl mRNA in the nervous system as well as in muscle and gills. The protein localized in all tissues analyzed with the exception of muscle. Immunofluorescence revealed localization of cAPPL in associative and sensory brain areas. We studied gene and protein expression during long-term memory consolidation using a well characterized memory model: the context-signal associative memory in this crab species. mRNA levels varied at different time points during long-term memory consolidation and correlated with cAPPL protein levels CONCLUSIONS: cAPPL mRNA and protein is widely distributed in the central nervous system of the crab and the time course of expression suggests a role of cAPPL during long-term memory formation.",2.665,1683
22658331,"Did a discrete event 200,000-100,000 years ago produce modern humans?",['Weaver TD'],Journal of human evolution,2012,"Scenarios for modern human origins are often predicated on the assumption that modern humans arose 200,000-100,000 years ago in Africa. This assumption implies that something 'special' happened at this point in time in Africa, such as the speciation that produced Homo sapiens, a severe bottleneck in human population size, or a combination of the two. The common thread is that after the divergence of the modern human and Neandertal evolutionary lineages  approximately 400,000 years ago, there was another discrete event near in time to the Middle-Late Pleistocene boundary that produced modern humans. Alternatively, modern human origins could have been a lengthy process that lasted from the divergence of the modern human and Neandertal evolutionary lineages to the expansion of modern humans out of Africa, and nothing out of the ordinary happened 200,000-100,000 years ago in Africa. Three pieces of biological (fossil morphology and DNA sequences) evidence are typically cited in support of discrete event models. First, living human mitochondrial DNA haplotypes coalesce  approximately 200,000 years ago. Second, fossil specimens that are usually classified as 'anatomically modern' seem to appear shortly afterward in the African fossil record. Third, it is argued that these anatomically modern fossils are morphologically quite different from the fossils that preceded them. Here I use theory from population and quantitative genetics to show that lengthy process models are also consistent with current biological evidence. That this class of models is a viable option has implications for how modern human origins is conceptualized.",3.733,1213

All the gene products involved in different metabolic pathways of CA-MRSA in KEGG database were searched against the proteome of Homo sapiens using the BLASTp program and the threshold of E-value was set to as 0.001. After database searching, 152 putative targets were identified. Among all 152 putative targets, 39 genes encoding for putative targets were identified as the essential genes from the DEG database which are indispensable for the survival of CA-MRSA. After extensive literature review, 7 targets were identified as potential therapeutic drug target. These targets are Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, Phosphoglyceromutase, Purine nucleoside phosphorylase, Uridylate kinase, Tryptophan synthase subunit beta, Acetate kinase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase. Except Uridylate kinase all the identified targets were involved in more than one metabolic pathways of CA-MRSA which underlines the importance of drug targets.

E-3-methyl-2-hexanoic acid (3M2H) is one of the key odorous substances, but there are two contradictory reports about its precursor form. One report states that 3M2H linked non-covalently to apolipoprotein D (apoD) is the precursor, while a second report states that 3M2H-Gln identified in human axillary sweat is the precursor. Recently, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl hexanoic acid (HMHA) and 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexane-1-ol (3M3T) have also been identified and reported as characteristic components found in apocrine sweat. To better understand the formation of axillary odours and the structural relationships between these compounds and apoD, we characterized the linkage between odorous substances and apoD in human axillary secretions. ApoD was purified from human axillary secretions collected from 50 healthy female volunteers and was then digested by trypsin and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A Mascot search showed that 8 peaks identified in the trypsin-digested samples correspond to the masses calculated for theoretically digested apoD sequences and the purified protein was assigned as a precursor of apoD [Homo sapiens]. One spectrum corresponded to the theoretical peak of HMHA linked covalently to the N-terminal fragment of apoD. In contrast, no spectrum corresponded to the theoretical peak of a 3M2H adduct or to an unmodified N-terminal fragment of apoD.

Partly this is the result of historical influences, but it is also due to a rather fundamentalist adherence among paleoanthropologists to the tenets of the Neodarwinian Evolutionary Synthesis. The result has been a general paleoanthropological desire to project the species Homo sapiens back into the past as far and in as linear a manner as possible. However, it is clear that the human fossil record, like that of most other taxa, reveals a consistent pattern of systematic diversity--a diversity totally unreflected in the conventional minimalist interpretation of that record. Thus, the Neanderthals, both morphologically and behaviorally as distinctive a group of hominids as ever existed, are conventionally classified simply as a subspecies of our own species Homo sapiens--a classification that robs these extinct relatives of their evolutionary individuality. Only when we recognize the Neanderthals as a historically distinctive evolutionary entity, demanding understanding in its own terms, will we be able to do them proper justice.

With that motivation, we introduce IsoBase, the first publicly available ortholog database that focuses on functionally related proteins. The groupings were computed using the IsoRankN algorithm that uses spectral methods to combine sequence and PPI data and produce clusters of functionally related proteins.

However, they contain signals in the form of short stretches of nucleic acid sequences, for transcription start sites (TSS) that are recognized by the transcription factors (TFs). The core promoter region thus plays an important role in biological pathways (gene network and activation). It has been reported that these signals are composed of nucleotide hexamers in the promoter sequence (smaller sequences are likely to have too little information to be useful and longer sequences are too complex to be recognized by proteins) reasonably close to the TSS. The signals (nucleotide hexamers) have been identified by a similarity search on the eukaryotic promoter database (EPD, Homo sapiens). The signals have been classified, depending on their base composition. They have been have clustered using an algorithm, such that there are two and three nucleotide differences between the classes and a single nucleotide difference within a class. We have reclassified the hexamers taking the highest frequent hexamers present in the EPD (Homo sapiens) as the class representatives. Also we have tried to find whether the same composition is reflected on the miRNAs but found that they probably have other functions unrelated to promoter recognition.

The problem resolves itself into two parts, (i) the collection and collation of relevant data on human behaviour, and (ii) the taking of steps to change this behaviour. Part two has recently been greatly facilitated by the development of radio transmission via artificial satellite. While WHO is now making a start on both these aspects it is doing so at a relatively low level. Instead, the two phases of this new approach should be given top priority even if it means large scale reorganization of relevant university departments and even of WHO itself.

Three affiliative behaviours were recorded by focal sampling: spontaneous smiles, deliberate smiles and laughter. Interestingly, young men showed significantly higher proportions of deliberate smiles in comparison to laughter when interacting with people of a different age class than when interacting in same-age groups. The pattern of affiliative behaviours in women remained unaffected by the age composition of groups. This partly supports the power asymmetry hypothesis and suggests that in men, deliberate smiles could play a role in the regulation of hierarchical relationships.",0.889,431

We generated transgenic fly lines carrying constructs of both kinases under control of the GAL upstream activating sequence (UAS). Each UAS line was then crossed to a line in which GAL4 expression was driven by one of the following promoters, eyeless (ey), glass or decapentaplegic. Thus, different kinase mutants can be ectopically expressed in a promoter-dependent manner. We observed that the ectopic expression of either the wild-type or active form of Snk driven by the glass promoter resulted in a rough-eye phenotype. Nevertheless, the ectopic expression of HsHPK under the control of the ey promoter resulted in a small-eye phenotype. The results of this study demonstrated that ectopic expression of these two mammalian genes could be achieved by the regulation of Drosophila promoters. In addition, the effects of these ectopically expressed genes on eye development could be an implication of their functions with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, Drosophila eye, with the powerful genetic tools and vast information on eye development available, can be a useful system to probe the functions of mammalian genes in the postgenome era.",2.763,1742

Phylogenetic comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these strains with 23 closely related Paramecium species from GenBank Database enabled identification of Paramecium multimicronucleatum and Paramecium jenningsi. Some isolates did not show significant close association with other Paramecium species, and because of their unique position in the phylogenetic tree, they were considered new to the field.

In this article, secondary structure of 18SrRNA has also been analyzed as an additional and perhaps more reliable topological marker for species discrimination and for determining possible phylogenetic relationship between the ciliate species. On the basis of comparison of secondary structure of 18SrRNA of various isolated Paramacium strains, and among Paramecium caudatum pakistanicus, Tetrahymena thermophila, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens, it can be deduced that variable regions are more helpful in differentiating the species at interspecific level rather than at intraspecific level.

This paper presents a new computational approach, miRenSVM, for finding miRNA genes. Aiming at better prediction performance, an ensemble support vector machine (SVM) classifier is established to deal with the imbalance issue, and multi-loop features are included for identifying those pre-miRNAs with multi-loops. RESULTS: We collected a representative dataset, which contains 697 real miRNA precursors identified by experimental procedure and other computational methods, and 5428 pseudo ones from several datasets. Experiments showed that our miRenSVM achieved a 96.5% specificity and a 93.05% sensitivity on the dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, miRenSVM obtained better prediction results. We also applied our method to predict 14 Homo sapiens pre-miRNAs and 13 Anopheles gambiae pre-miRNAs that first appeared in miRBase13.0, MiRenSVM got a 100% prediction rate. Furthermore, performance evaluation was conducted over 27 additional species in miRBase13.0, and 92.84% (4863/5238) animal pre-miRNAs were correctly identified by miRenSVM. CONCLUSION: MiRenSVM is an ensemble support vector machine (SVM) classification system for better detecting miRNA genes, especially those with multi-loop secondary structure.",2.576,1601

The aberrant regulation of ACK1 promotes tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, ACK1 is regarded as a valid target in cancer therapy. Seven in absentia homolog (SIAH) ubiquitin ligases facilitate substrate ubiquitinylation that targets proteins to the proteasomal degradation pathway. Here we report that ACK1 and SIAH1 from Homo sapiens interact in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Protein-protein interaction studies and protein degradation analyses using deletion and point mutants of ACK1 verify that SIAH1 and the related SIAH2 interact with ACK1. The association between SIAHs and ACK1 depends on the integrity of a highly conserved SIAH-binding motif located in the far C-terminus of ACK1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interaction of ACK1 with SIAH1 and the induction of proteasomal degradation of ACK1 by SIAH1 are independent of ACK1's kinase activity. Chemical inhibitors blocking proteasomal activity corroborate that SIAH1 and SIAH2 destabilize the ACK1 protein by inducing its proteasomal turnover. This mechanism apparently differs from the lysosomal pathway targeting ACK1 after stimulation with the epidermal growth factor. Our data also show that ACK1, but not ACK1 mutants lacking the SIAH binding motif, has a discernable negative effect on SIAH levels. Additionally, knockdown approaches targeting the SIAH2 mRNA uncover specifically that the induction of SIAH2 expression, by hormonally-induced estrogen receptor (ER) activation, decreases the levels of ACK1 in luminal human breast cancer cells. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms modulating ACK1 and they position SIAH ubiquitin ligases as negative regulators of ACK1 in transformed cells.",8.459,1053

However, data about the volume and anatomical limits of visual brain structures in the extant taxa phylogenetically closest to humans-the apes-remain scarce, thus complicating tests of hypotheses about evolutionary changes. Here, we analyze new volumetric data for the primary visual cortex and the lateral geniculate nucleus to determine whether or not the human brain departs from allometrically-expected patterns of brain organization. Primary visual cortex volumes were compared to lunate sulcus position in apes to investigate whether or not inferences about brain reorganization made from fossil hominin endocasts are reliable in this context. In contrast to previous studies, in which all species were relatively poorly sampled, the current study attempted to evaluate the degree of intraspecific variability by including numerous hominoid individuals (particularly Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens). In addition, we present and compare volumetric data from three new hominoid species-Pan paniscus, Pongo pygmaeus, and Symphalangus syndactylus. These new data demonstrate that hominoid visual brain structure volumes vary more than previously appreciated. In addition, humans have relatively reduced primary visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus volumes as compared to allometric predictions from other hominoids. These results suggest that inferences about the position of the lunate sulcus on fossil endocasts may provide information about brain organization.",3.733,1721

 Psychiatric Genetics",2011,"Protocadherin11 is located on both the X and Y chromosomes in Homo sapiens but only on the X chromosome in other hominid species. The pairing of PCDH11Y with PCDH11X arose following a duplicative 3.5 Mb translocation from the ancestral X chromosome to the Y chromosome several million years ago. The genes are highly expressed in fetal brain and spinal cord. The evolutionary consequence of this duplication has been proposed to include the sexual dimorphism of cerebral asymmetry and the hominid specific transition to the capacity for language. We report a case of a male child referred for genetic investigation of severe language delay. Microarray analysis indicated the presence of a 220 Kb intragenic deletion at Xq21.31 involving the PCDH11X gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a BAC probe mapping to intron 2 of the Protocadherin11X/Y gene pair confirmed loss of the locus on both the X and Y chromosomes. The X chromosome deletion was maternally inherited, but the Y chromosome deletion was found to be a de novo occurrence in this child. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that the Protocadherin11X/Y gene plays a role in language development in humans and that rare copy number variation is a possible mechanism for communication disorders.",1.204,1498

Part B, New anatomist",2004,"The matter of biological differentiation among human beings has been a perennial concern of physical anthropologists, whose profession grew out of the monogenist/polygenist debates of the 18th century, and who periodically feel impelled to issue sonorous pronouncements on the subject. In spite of (or perhaps because of) the extensive and difficult cultural ramifications of the race issue, such pronouncements have usually presented the matter of race as one that requires extensive bioanthropological exegesis. In reality, however, race is the most banal of biological issues. Within any species, including Homo sapiens, two biological processes are possible: physical differentiation (as routinely occurs in small population isolates) and reintegration (should the resulting differentiated populations come together in the absence of any barrier to mating). The history of Homo sapiens reflects both of these processes: initial differentiation among small, scattered populations in the later part of the Pleistocene, and subsequent reintegration as the human population expanded and these populations came together once more. It is for this reason that, while certain modal physical types can be recognized on any urban street today (differentiation), it is impossible to recognize any clear boundaries between them (reintegration). All of this is perfectly unremarkable in evolutionary terms, and requires no special explanation. The complexities of the race issue are real, of course, and it is important that we come to terms with them; but they will not be resolved by biologists.",1.542,1757

A total of 100 patients with HCC, 100 cases of chronic hepatitis B and 100 health adults were enrolled in this present study. Two common polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs: Homo sapiens miRNA-146a (hsa-mir-146a) (rs291016, guanine to cytosine [G-C]) and hsa-mir-499 (rs3746444; adenine to guanine [C-T]) were genotyped by PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and confirmed by bidirectional DNA sequencing. Significant differences were found in frequency and distribution of the genotypes of miRNA-499 between the HCC and the control group. Compared with miRNA-499 T/T, the odds ratio (OR) of patients with miRNA-499 C/C for developing HCC was 3.630 (95% CI: 1.545-8.532), and OR for developing HBV-related HCC was 3.133 (95% CI: 1.248-7.861). There was no significant association between miRNA-146a polymorphism and the risk of HCC in all subjects.

C. apella milk averaged 5.22% fat, 2.40% CP, 6.94% lactose, 16.48% DM, and 0.89 kcal/g. Fat was the most variable macronutrient and was significantly higher in samples collected after 2 months of lactation. To explore the adaptive significance of C. apella milk composition, results were compared with data on milk composition from a closely related cebid, Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis, and another large-brained anthropoid, Homo sapiens. C. apella milk was only significantly different from Saimiri milk in CP and the proportion of energy from CP. Compared with human milk, C. apella milk was lower in lactose but higher in fat, CP, DM, GE, and the proportion of energy from CP.

A predominant factor influencing Homo sapiens' motivation to reciprocate is an individual's perceived benefit resulting from the value of received help. But hitherto it has been unclear whether other species also base their decision to cooperate on the quality of received help. Previous experiments have demonstrated that Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, cooperate using direct reciprocity decision rules in a variant of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, where they preferentially help cooperators instead of defectors. But, as the quality of obtained benefits has not been varied, it is yet unclear whether rats use the value of received help as decision criterion to pay help back. Here, we tested whether rats distinguish between different cooperators depending purely on the quality of their help. Our data show that a rat's propensity to reciprocate help is, indeed, adjusted to the perceived quality of the partner's previous help. When cooperating with two conspecific partners expending the same effort, rats apparently rely on obtained benefit to adjust their level of returned help.",3.248,1442

The plasmodium species vivax and falciparum cause over 75 % clinical malaria cases. Until now, gene-based strategies against malaria have only been applied to plasmodium species and their mosquito-vector. Merozoites of these two respective plasmodium species target and invade red blood cells (RBCs) by using the duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), and Sialic Acid (SLC4A1) residues of the O-linked glycans of Glycophorin A. RBCs of naturally selected duffy-negative blacks are resistant to P.vivax tropism. We hypothesized that artificial aberration of the host-pathway by target mutagenesis of either RBC -receptors, may abolish or reduce susceptibility of the host to malaria. As a first step towards the experimental actualization of these concepts, we aimed to identify zinc finger arrays (ZFAs) for constructing ZFNs that target genes of either wild-type host-RBC- receptors. METHODS: In-Silico Gene & Genome Informatics RESULTS: Using the genomic contextual nucleotide-sequences of homo-sapiens darc and glycophorin-a, and the ZFN-consortia software- CoDA-ZiFiT-ZFA and CoDA-ZiFiT-ZFN: we identified 163 and over 1,000 single zinc finger arrays (sZFAs) that bind sequences within the genes for the two respective RBC-receptors. Second, 2 and 18 paired zinc finger arrays (pZFAs) that are precursors for zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) capable of cleaving the genes for darc and glycophorin-a were respectively assembled. Third, a mega-BLAST evaluation of the genome-wide cleavage specificity of this set of ZFNs was done, revealing alternate homologous nucleotide targets in the human genome other than darc or glycophorin A. CONCLUSIONS: ZFNs engineered with these ZFA-precursors--with further optimization to enhance their specificity to only darc and glycophorin-a, could be used in constructing an experimental gene-based-malaria vaccine. Alternatively, meganucleases and transcription activator-like (TAL) nucleases that target conserved stretches of darc and glycophorin-a DNA may serve the purpose of abrogating invasion of RBCs by falciparam and vivax plasmodia species.",0,1135

While the functions of ribosomal protein-encoding genes (RPGs) are highly conserved, the evolution of their regulatory mechanisms is remarkably dynamic. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RPGs are unusual in that they are commonly present as two highly similar gene copies and in that they are over-represented among intron-containing genes. To investigate the role of introns in the regulation of RPG expression, we constructed 16 S. cerevisiae strains with precise deletions of RPG introns. We found that several yeast introns function to repress rather than to increase steady-state mRNA levels. Among these, the RPS9A and RPS9B introns were required for cross-regulation of the two paralogous gene copies, which is consistent with the duplication of an autoregulatory circuit. To test for similar intron function in animals, we performed an experimental test and comparative analyses for autoregulation among distantly related animal RPS9 orthologs. Overexpression of an exogenous RpS9 copy in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells induced alternative splicing and degradation of the endogenous copy by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Also, analysis of expressed sequence tag data from distantly related animals, including Homo sapiens and Ciona intestinalis, revealed diverse alternatively-spliced RPS9 isoforms predicted to elicit NMD. We propose that multiple forms of splicing regulation among RPS9 orthologs from various eukaryotes operate analogously to translational repression of the alpha operon by S4, the distant prokaryotic ortholog. Thus, RPS9 orthologs appear to have independently evolved variations on a fundamental autoregulatory circuit.",7.528,1394

We propose that the basic framework for physiologic gene regulation was selected during an era of obligatory physical activity, as the survival of our Late Palaeolithic (50 000-10 000 BC) ancestors depended on hunting and gathering. A sedentary lifestyle in such an environment probably meant elimination of that individual organism. The phenotype of the present day Homo sapiens genome is much different from that of our ancient ancestors, primarily as a consequence of expressing evolutionarily programmed Late Palaeolithic genes in an environment that is predominantly sedentary. In this sense, our current genome is maladapted, resulting in abnormal gene expression, which in turn frequently manifests itself as clinically overt disease. We speculate that some of these genes still play a role in survival by causing premature death from chronic diseases produced by physical inactivity. We also contend that the current scientific evidence supports the notion that disruptions in cellular homeostasis are diminished in magnitude in physically active individuals compared with sedentary individuals due to the natural selection of gene expression that supports the physically active lifestyle displayed by our ancestors. We speculate that genes evolved with the expectation of requiring a certain threshold of physical activity for normal physiologic gene expression, and thus habitual exercise in sedentary cultures restores perturbed homeostatic mechanisms towards the normal physiological range of the Palaeolithic Homo sapiens. This hypothesis allows us to ask the question of whether normal physiological values change as a result of becoming sedentary. In summary, in sedentary cultures, daily physical activity normalizes gene expression towards patterns established to maintain the survival in the Late Palaeolithic era.",0,1740

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate the net systemic load of acid (net endogenous acid production; NEAP) from retrojected ancestral preagricultural diets and to compare it with that of contemporary diets, which are characterized by an imbalance of nutrient precursors of hydrogen and bicarbonate ions that induces a lifelong, low-grade, pathogenically significant systemic metabolic acidosis. DESIGN: Using established computational methods, we computed NEAP for a large number of retrojected ancestral preagricultural diets and compared them with computed and measured values for typical American diets. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) NEAP for 159 retrojected preagricultural diets was -88 +/- 82 mEq/d; 87% were net base-producing. The computational model predicted NEAP for the average American diet (as recorded in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) as 48 mEq/d, within a few percentage points of published measured values for free-living Americans; the model, therefore, was not biased toward generating negative NEAP values. The historical shift from negative to positive NEAP was accounted for by the displacement of high-bicarbonate-yielding plant foods in the ancestral diet by cereal grains and energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods in the contemporary diet-neither of which are net base-producing. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that diet-induced metabolic acidosis and its sequelae in humans eating contemporary diets reflect a mismatch between the nutrient composition of the diet and genetically determined nutritional requirements for optimal systemic acid-base status.",0,466

Nevertheless, there are examples of polygenic traits that are bound to be under selection, but studies devoted to apply population genetics methods to unveil such occurrence are still lacking. Stature provides a relevant example of well-studied polygenic trait for which is now available a genome-wide association study which has identified the genes involved in this trait, and which is known to be under selection. We studied the behavior of F(ST) in a simulated toy model to detect population differentiation on a generic polygenic phenotype under selection. The simulations showed that the set of alleles involved in the trait has a higher mean F(ST) value than those undergoing genetic drift only. In view of this we looked for an increase in the mean F(ST) value of the 180 variants associated to human height. For this set of alleles we found F(ST) to be significantly higher than the genomic background (p = 0.0356). On the basis of a statistical analysis we excluded that the increase was just due to the presence of outliers. We also proved as marginal the role played by local adaptation phenomena, even on different phenotypes in linkage disequilibrium with genetic variants involved in height. The increase of F(ST) for the set of alleles involved in a polygenic trait seems to provide an example of symmetry breaking phenomenon concerning the population differentiation. The splitting in the allele frequencies would be driven by the initial conditions in the population dynamics which are stochastically modified by events like drift, bottlenecks, etc, and other stochastic events like the born of new mutations.",3.234,1579

Here we cloned and characterized a 15,792-bp full-length LdRyR cDNA that encoded a 5128-amino acid protein. LdRyR shares 85-92% amino acid similarities with other insect RyR homologues, and 59-61% similarities with those from Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens. All hallmarks of the RyR proteins are conserved in LdRyR. LdRyR has a MIR domain, two RIH domains, three SPRY domains, four copies of RyR domain and a RIH-associated domain in the N-terminus, and it possesses two consensus calcium ion-binding EF-hand motifs and six predicted transmembrane helices in the C-terminus. Temporal, spatial and tissue-specific expression patterns of LdRyR were evaluated. LdRyR expression level was increased constantly from egg to wandering stages, dropped in pupal stage and was increased again in the adult stage. It was widely expressed in the head, thorax and abdomen of day 3 fourth-instar larvae. Moreover, it was ubiquitously expressed in all inspected tissues including epidermis, foregut, midgut, ileum, rectum, fat body, ventral ganglia and Malpighian tubules in day 3 fourth-instar larvae. Dietary introduction of double-stranded RNA of LdRyR significantly reduced the mRNA levels of the target gene in the larvae and adults, respectively, and significantly decreased chlorantraniliprole-induced mortalities.

Discovered in the Kikorongo Crater of Queen Elizabeth National Park in 1961, this specimen was informally assigned to Homo sapiens (although never described) and tentatively dated to the late Pleistocene. However, because aspects of the external morphology of the femur align the fossil with the African great apes, we suggest that the Kikorongo femur may be the first postcranial fossil of the genus Pan. Like the African apes, the Kikorongo specimen lacks both an obturator externus groove and an intertrochanteric line. It has a short femoral neck with a circular cross section, and a narrow and deep superior notch. Using resampling statistics and discriminant function analysis, the Kikorongo femur clustered with the genus Pan, as opposed to Gorilla or Homo. However, if the specimen is from Pan, it would be large for this taxon. Furthermore, features that clearly distinguish the external morphology of Plio-Pleistocene hominin proximal femora from African ape femora, such as the shape of the femoral neck in cross section and femoral neck length, have converged in Holocene humans and African apes. Unfortunately, the internal morphology of the femoral neck of the Kikorongo fossil was not discernable. Although we hypothesize that the Kikorongo femur is from the genus Pan, there is such variability in the proximal femora of modern humans that, although it would be an unusual human, it remains possible that this fossil represents H. sapiens.",3.733,1837

 Series B, Biological sciences",2004,"During the processes of human population dispersal around the world over the past 50 000-100 000 years, along with associated cultural evolution and inter-population contact and conflict, there have been several major transitions in the relationships of Homo sapiens with the natural world, animate and inanimate. Each of these transitions has resulted in the emergence of new or unfamiliar infectious diseases. The three great historical transitions since the initial advent of agriculture and livestock herding, from ca. 10 000 years ago, occurred when: (i) early agrarian-based settlements enabled sylvatic enzootic microbes to make contact with Homo sapiens; (ii) early Eurasian civilizations (such as the Greek and Roman empires, China and south Asia) came into military and commercial contact, ca. 3000-2000 years ago, swapping their dominant infections; and (iii) European expansionism, over the past five centuries, caused the transoceanic spread of often lethal infectious diseases. This latter transition is best known in relation to the conquest of the Americas by Spanish conquistadores, when the inadvertent spread of measles, smallpox and influenza devastated the Amerindian populations.Today, we are living through the fourth of these great transitional periods. The contemporary spread and increased lability of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflect the combined and increasingly widespread impacts of demographic, environmental, behavioural, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology. Modern clinical medicine has, via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the use of hypodermic syringes, created new opportunities for microbes. These have contributed to the rising iatrogenic problems of hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and several other viral infections. Meanwhile, the injudicious use of antibiotics has been a rare instance of human action actually increasing 'biodiversity'. Another aspect of this fourth transition is that modern hyper-hygienic living restricts microbial exposure in early life. This, in the 1950s, may have contributed to an epidemic of more serious, disabling, poliomyelitis, affecting older children than those affected in earlier, more endemic decades. As with previous human-microbe transitions, a new equilibrial state may lie ahead. However, it certainly will not entail a world free of infectious diseases. Any mature, sustainable, human ecology must come to terms with both the need for, and the needs of, the microbial species that help to make up the interdependent system of life on Earth.

Least-square planes were generated for each articular surface, and the angles between the planes were compared. Each extant species displays an overall pattern that distinguishes it from the others. The observed angles in G. gorilla and P. troglodytes are more similar to one other than either is to H. sapiens. Our results, obtained from using new 3D modeling and analytical tools, raise interesting questions about the functional capabilities of the fossil trapezia. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that A.L.333-80 is morphologically more similar to that of modern humans, whereas the O.H.7 trapezium is more similar to that of the gorilla. Significant differences between A.L.333-80 and the extant species occur, but some similarities to humans suggest the ability to form the distinctively human forceful pad-to-side and three-jaw chuck grips. Some key morphological differences from humans highlighted and quantified by our research suggest limitations in the functional capabilities of the O.H.7 trapezium, particularly in those that facilitate pronation at the base of the second metacarpal. If the O.H.7 trapezium represents part of the hand responsible for manufacturing and using the stone tools found at Olduvai, our results suggest that the hand manipulated the stones in a way for which we have no modern analog. Alternative considerations are that the O.H.7 trapezium is not representative of other trapezia from its species (i.e., N=1), or that it represents another primate or hominid species.",2.379,1828

The molecular mechanisms responsible for thermal effects on spermatogenesis are, however, just beginning to be elucidated. The existence of specific messenger RNA (mRNA) remnants contained within freshly ejaculated sperm has been identified in several species. Investigators have obtained differential RNA profiles of infertile men compared with fertile individuals; however, there are limited to the probes, which are mostly derived from nucleic acids of testicular tissues of either human or mice. The objective of this study was to investigate mRNA remnants from ejaculated sperm of the domestic swine and uncover important clues regarding the molecular regulation of spermatogenesis under environmental thermo-impacts. We utilized the remnant mRNA collected from swine ejaculated sperm as the target source to detect the global gene expression in summer and in winter by swine sperm-specific oligonucleotide microarray. Sixty-seven transcripts were differentially expressed with statistical differences between seasons of sperm samples collected, including forty-nine in winter (49/67) and eighteen in summer (18/67). There were only 33 of these transcripts that could be annotated to gene ontology hierarchy with the database of Homo sapiens and their functions mostly were involved in variety of metabolic processes. Moreover, these studies also confirmed that significant differences of gene expression profiles were found in swine sperm when comparisons were made between ejaculates collected during the winter and the summer season under the subtropical area such as Taiwan. Even though most of the genes found in our experiments are still poorly understood in terms of their true functions in spermatogenesis, bioinformatics analysis suggested that they are involved in a broad spectrum of biochemical processes including gamete generation. These concordant profiles should permit the development of a non-invasive testing protocol to assess the functional capacity of sperm as well as a new molecular selection scheme for fine breeding swine.",1.511,1707
3657190,Codon usage in Homo sapiens: evidence for a coding pattern on the non-coding strand and evolutionary implications of dinucleotide discrimination.,['Alff-Steinberger C'],Journal of theoretical biology,1987,"This study reports the analysis of codon usage in 35 complete Homo sapiens genes. Both codon frequency and inter-codon interference exhibit patterns of evolutionary interest. There is a significant positive correlation between the frequency with which a given codon is used and the frequency with which its complement is used. Since the frequency of appearance of the complementary codon on the coding strand is equal to the frequency of appearance of the original codon on the non-coding strand, in the same phase, the non-coding strand is found to resemble the coding strand in triplet composition. The same effect has been observed in Escherichia coli. This preference for the use of certain complementary triplets as codons suggests that the evolution of the use of the genetic code depended to some extent upon the double-stranded nature of the coding material. In addition, the effect of discrimination against the use of two dinucleotides, CpG and UpA, is observed in codon usage and also in adjacent codon interference. Codons beginning with G, or A, are unlikely to be preceded by codons ending in C, or U, respectively. Consideration of codon assignment in the genetic code together with the observed CpG infrequency suggests that the evolution of the code may have been influenced by conditions in which the use of CpG dinucleotides was unfavorable. The infrequent use of UpA dinucleotides can be explained as the result of frameshift mutation during gene evolution.",2.116,374

Body and brain masses predict a 25-year life span for Cebus, although recorded life spans exceed 50 years. Cebus are geographically widespread, have a female-bonded social organization convergent with Old World monkeys, and are primarily frugivorous, though the diet is heavily supplemented with vertebrate prey. Regressions of phylogenetically independent contrasts indicate that body mass and brain mass relationships to longevity remain significant when phylogeny is controlled and that brain mass is a more robust predictor than body mass.

The commonly used random sampling is prone to yield less representative negative data with considerable false negatives. Meanwhile rational constraints are seldom exerted on model selection to reduce the risk of false positive predictions for most of the existing computational methods. In this work, we propose a novel negative data sampling method based on one-class SVM (support vector machine, SVM) to predict proteome-wide protein interactions between HTLV retrovirus and Homo sapiens, wherein one-class SVM is used to choose reliable and representative negative data, and two-class SVM is used to yield proteome-wide outcomes as predictive feedback for rational model selection. Computational results suggest that one-class SVM is more suited to be used as negative data sampling method than two-class PPI predictor, and the predictive feedback constrained model selection helps to yield a rational predictive model that reduces the risk of false positive predictions. Some predictions have been validated by the recent literature. Lastly, gene ontology based clustering of the predicted PPI networks is conducted to provide valuable cues for the pathogenesis of HTLV retrovirus.",5.578,850

In this study, the effects of this abundant modified nucleotide on the structure and stability of H69 were compared with those of uridine. The role of a loop nucleotide substitution from A in bacteria (position 1918 in Escherichia coli 23S rRNA) to G in eukaryotes (position in 3734 in H. sapiens) was also examined. The thermodynamic parameters were obtained through UV melting studies, and differences in the modified and unmodified RNA structures were examined by 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy. In addition, a [1,3-15N]Psi phosphoramidite was used to generate H69 analogs with site-specific 15N labels. By using this approach, different Psi residues can be clearly distinguished from one another in 1H NMR experiments. The effects of pseudouridine on H. sapiens H69 are consistent with previous studies on tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA models in which the nucleotide offers stabilization of duplex regions through PsiN1H-mediated hydrogen bonds. The overall secondary structure and base-pairing patterns of human H69 are similar to the bacterial RNA, consistent with the idea that ribosome structure and function are highly conserved. Nonetheless, pseudouridine-containing RNAs have subtle differences in their structures and stabilities compared to the corresponding uridine-containing analogs, suggesting possible roles for Psi such as maintaining translation fidelity.",0,1815

The specimens were assigned to Carnegie stages 11-13. Serial transverse sections were examined and graphic reconstructions were prepared. The early development of the neural tube is basically similar in all the species investigated but differences in detail are noticeable. The mesencephalic flexure serves in all cases as a landmark for malpighi's tripartite subdivision of the brain. The nonhuman embryos seem to show a little more variation than the human in the closure of the neuropores in relation to somitic count. With the exception of the later-appearing terminal-vomeronasal component, all major portions of the neural crest as classified by O'Rahilly ('65) are represented in both the nonhuman and the human embryos studied. No crest is present at the level of rhombomere 1, nor at rhombomere 3 except in the platyrrhines and some human embryos, nor at rhombomere 5 except in certain human specimens. An indication of the division of the trigeminal ganglion into its primary divisions is rare at stage 11 (C. apella), may be visible at stage 12 (Alouatta, macaca, Homo), and is definite (in Homo) at stage 13. Ganglionic contributions from head ectoderm (epipharyngeal placodes), as previously described in the human and some other vertebrate embryos, were sought and found in Cebus apella. In both nonhuman and human, a tendency is noted whereby the rostral limit of the occipitospinal crest, high at stage 11, seems to descend relatively at stage 12, and ascend again at stage 13 (at least in the human) to become associated with the appearance of the accessory and hypoglossal nerves.

Furthermore, in a monogamous mating system, a biased OSR is expected to lead to lowered mean fecundity among individuals of the more abundant sex. We studied the influence of OSR on the sex ratio of newborns and on the population birth rate using an extensive data set (n = 14,420 births) from pre-industrial (1775-1850) Finland. The overall effect of current OSR on sex ratio at birth was significant, and in the majority of the 21 parishes included in this study, more sons were produced when males were rarer than females. This suggests that humans adjusted the sex ratio of their offspring in response to the local OSR to maximize the reproductive success of their progeny. Birth rate and, presumably, also population growth rate increased when the sex ratio (males:females) among reproductive age classes approached equality. However, the strength of these patterns varied across the parishes, suggesting that factors other than OSR (e.g. socioeconomic or environmental factors may also have influenced the sex ratio at birth and the birth rate.",0,467

In various mammals such as rat, dog, macaque as well as in cheirogaleid primates, most of the large neurons, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells and neocortical pyramidal cells, show heavy lipofuscin accumulation in adulthood. In contrast, a well-known yet poorly studied feature of the aging human brain is that although lipofuscin accumulation is most marked in large neurons of the cerebral cortex, the large neurons of the cerebellar cortex-the Purkinje cells-appear to remain free of lipofuscin accumulation. It is however, not known whether this characteristic of human Purkinje cells is shared with other primates or other mammals. This study reports results from histological observation of Purkinje cells in humans, non-human primates, and other mammals.

The neandertal dural sinus drainage pattern is organized in a more asymmetric mode, in such a way that the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) drains either to the right or to the left transverse sinuses, but in no case in a confluent mode (i.e. simultaneous continuation of SSS with both right (RTS) and left (LTS) transverse sinuses). Besides, the superior sagittal sinus shows an accentuated deviation from of the mid-sagittal plane in its way to the RTS in 35% of neandertals. This condition, which increases the asymmetry of the system, is almost nonexistent neither in the analyzed Homo fossil species sample nor in that of anatomically modern humans. Regarding the cerebral occipito-petalias, neandertals manifest one of the lowest percentages of left petalia of the Homo sample (including modern H. sapiens). As left occipito-petalia is the predominant pattern in hominins, it seems as if neandertals would have developed a different pattern of brain hemispheres asymmetry.

This disease is difficult to control due to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogenic strains and the only available treatment antitoxin which can target the neurotoxin at the extracellular level and cannot reverse the paralysis. This study framework is based on comprehensive systems-scale analysis of genomic sequence homology and phylogenetic relationships among Clostridium, other infectious bacteria, host and human gut flora. First, the entire 2628-annotated genes of this bacterial genome were categorized into essential, non-essential and virulence genes. The results obtained showed that 39% of essential proteins that functionally interact with virulence proteins were identified, which could be a key to new interventions that may kill the bacteria and minimize the host damage caused by the virulence factors. Second, a comprehensive comparative COGs and blast sequence analysis of these proteins and host proteins to minimize the risks of side effects was carried out. This revealed that 47% of a set of C. botulinum proteins were evolutionary related with Homo sapiens proteins to sort out the non-human homologs. Third, orthology analysis with other infectious bacteria to assess broad-spectrum effects was executed and COGs were mostly found in Clostridia, Bacilli (Firmicutes), and in alpha and beta Proteobacteria. Fourth, a comparative phylogenetic analysis was performed with human microbiota to filter out drug targets that may also affect human gut flora. This reduced the list of candidate proteins down to 131. Finally, the role of these putative drug targets in clostridial biological pathways was studied while subcellular localization of these candidate proteins in bacterial cellular system exhibited that 68% of the proteins were located in the cytoplasm, out of which 6% was virulent. Finally, this framework may serve as a general computational strategy for future drug target identification in infectious diseases.",2.284,928

Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and microcephalin. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104]. In the present study, we found a significant correlation between the load of the derived alleles of ASPM and tone perception in a group of European Americans who did not speak a tone language. Moreover, preliminary results showed a significant correlation between ASPM load and hemodynamic responses to lexical tones in the auditory cortex, and such correlation remained after phonemic awareness, auditory working memory, and non-verbal IQ were controlled. As in previous studies, no significant correlation between ASPM and cognitive measures were found. MCPH1 did not correlate with any measures.

It is still debated, however, whether these hominids belong in their own species, Homo neanderthalensis, or represent an extinct variant of Homo sapiens. Our ongoing studies indicate that the Neanderthals differ from modern humans in their skeletal anatomy in more ways than have been recognized up to now. The purpose of this contribution is to describe specializations of the Neanderthal internal nasal region that make them unique not only among hominids but possibly among terrestrial mammals in general as well.

26540733,Why does multiple sclerosis only affect human primates?,"[""'t Hart BA""]","Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",2016,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) develops exclusively in humans. Non-human primates are resistant against MS, although they are highly susceptible to the MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Unravelling of the cause(s) underlying this discrepancy is highly relevant as insights might be gained into the elusive event(s) that trigger(s) MS. A well-established difference between the human primate (Homo sapiens) and non-human primates is that humans are unable to synthesize the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). VIEWPOINT: We propose the concept that long-term ingestion by human primates of the foreign Neu5Gc, via red meat consumption, is an ignored environmental risk factor for MS. Conceptually, incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc into vital regions of the central nervous system, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the axon-myelin unit, creates targets for binding of de novo synthesized heterophilic anti-NeuGc antibodies. Binding of the antibodies can cause BBB leakage and destabilization of the axon-myelin coupling. The ensuing cytodegeneration and release of self-antigens could be a start of the characteristic pathological features of MS.",0.884,635

These glucose kinases phosphorylate d-glucose with co-substrate ATP and yield glucose 6-phosphate and are involved in essential metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. An inhibitor class was conceived that is selective for T. cruzi glucokinase (TcGlcK) using structure-based drug design involving glucosamine having a linker from the C2 amino that terminates with a hydrophobic group either being phenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl, or dioxobenzo[b]thiophenyl groups. The synthesis and characterization for two of the four compounds are presented while the other two compounds were commercially available. Four high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of TcGlcK inhibitor complexes are reported along with enzyme inhibition constants (Ki) for TcGlcK and Homo sapiens hexokinase IV (HsHxKIV). These glucosamine analogue inhibitors include three strongly selective TcGlcK inhibitors and a fourth inhibitor, benzoyl glucosamine (BENZ-GlcN), which is a similar variant exhibiting a shorter linker. Carboxybenzyl glucosamine (CBZ-GlcN) was found to be the strongest glucokinase inhibitor known to date, having a Ki of 0.71+/-0.05muM. Also reported are two biologically active inhibitors against in vitro T. cruzi culture that were BENZ-GlcN and CBZ-GlcN, with intracellular amastigote growth inhibition IC50 values of 16.08+/-0.16muM and 48.73+/-0.69muM, respectively.

By utilizing modern high throughput microarray technology, it has become feasible to obtain gene expressions data and turn it into knowledge that explains the regulatory behavior of genes. In this study, an unsupervised nonlinear model was proposed to infer gene regulatory networks on a genome-wide scale. The proposed model consists of two components, a robust correlation estimator and a nonlinear recurrent model. The robust correlation estimator was used to initialize the parameters of the nonlinear recurrent curve-fitting model. Then the initialized model was used to fit the microarray data. The model was used to simulate the underlying nonlinear regulatory mechanisms in biological organisms. The proposed algorithm was applied to infer the regulatory mechanisms of the general network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the pulmonary disease pathways in Homo sapiens. The proposed algorithm requires no prior biological knowledge to predict linkages between genes. The prediction results were checked against true positive links obtained from the YEASTRACT database, the TRANSFAC database, and the KEGG database.

Though some results point to human-animal continuities in this domain, they face the dominant criticism that animals' performances might be associative. A persistent problem is that animal-metacognition paradigms present static environments of risk and reward that may foster inflexible and conditioned responding. Those environments do not challenge animals to show the flexibility in their decision strategies that could indicate an antecedent capacity to metacognition. Accordingly, we tested macaques and humans on an uncertainty-monitoring paradigm in which risk changed dynamically. Participants classified stimuli of different difficulties while also choosing when to use a cashout response to collect the accumulated rewards that would be forfeit on a discrimination error. Macaques (Macaca mulatta) and humans flexibly adjusted their decision criteria to achieve appropriate protection against the cost of error that could differ depending on trial difficulty and the number of rewards at risk. In particular, monkeys widened their cashout-response region as their accumulated rewards increased, providing more protection against a more costly error. These findings demonstrate a new continuity between humans' and animals' uncertainty systems. They reveal a calibration by macaques of present risk to trial difficulty tolerated. They show that animals' uncertainty-monitoring and risk-management systems have substantial trial-by-trial flexibility.",1.949,69

The purpose of this study was to determine if previously described Homo sapiens kinesin family member 21A (KIF21A) mutations were responsible for CFEOM in these two Chinese pedigrees. METHODS: Clinical characterization and genetic studies were performed. Microsatellite genotyping for linkage to the CFEOM1 and CFEOM3 loci was performed. The probands were screened for KIF21A mutations by bidirectional direct sequencing. Once a mutation was detected in the proband, all other participating family members and 100 unrelated control normal individuals were screened for the mutation. RESULTS: All affected individuals in family XT shared the common manifestations of CFEOM1. Family YT had two affected individuals, a mother and a daughter. The daughter had CFEOM1, while her mother never had congential ptosis but did have limited extraocular movements status post strabismus surgery. Haplotype analysis revealed that pedigree XT was linked to the 12q CFEOM1 locus and the affected memberes harbored the second most common missense mutation in KIF21A (2,861G>A, R954Q). Family YT harbored the most common missense de novo mutation in KIF21A (2,860C>T, R954W). Both of these mutations have been previously described.

The ptch1C727VfsX745 and ptch1-S733IfsX736 mutations have been identified in patients with NBCCSassociated keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). In the present study, we found that the molecular mechanisms regulated by the non-canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway through cyclin B1 are involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. In contrast to wild-type ptch1, ptch1-C727VfsX745 and ptch1S733IfsX736 clearly exhibited reduced binding to cyclin B1. Moreover, the cells expressing these two mutations demonstrated an increase in cell cycle progression and these two mutation constructs failed to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, the mutants enhanced the activity of glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), a downstream reporter of Hh signaling. Thus, our data suggest that the non-canonical Hh pathway mediated through ptch1 and cyclin B1 is involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs.

The composition and structure of microbial communities vary considerably depending on the host and environmental factors. We conducted comparative analyses of the primate vaginal microbiome using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of a phylogenetically broad range of primates to test for factors affecting the diversity of primate vaginal ecosystems. The nine primate species included: humans (Homo sapiens), yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), olive baboons (Papio anubis), lemurs (Propithecus diadema), howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra), red colobus (Piliocolobus rufomitratus), vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops), mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Our results indicated that all primates exhibited host-specific vaginal microbiota and that humans were distinct from other primates in both microbiome composition and diversity. In contrast to the gut microbiome, the vaginal microbiome showed limited congruence with host phylogeny, and neither captivity nor diet elicited substantial effects on the vaginal microbiomes of primates. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance and Wilcoxon tests revealed correlations among vaginal microbiota and host species-specific socioecological factors, particularly related to sexuality, including: female promiscuity, baculum length, gestation time, mating group size and neonatal birth weight. The proportion of unclassified taxa observed in nonhuman primate samples increased with phylogenetic distance from humans, indicative of the existence of previously unrecognized microbial taxa.

Polymorphism does not follow the classical pattern of three hypervariable regions per domain and is found in all species studied; exon 3 (equivalent to the alpha 2 protein domain) shows stop codons in the Cercopithecinae group but not in the Pongidae and human groups. Dendrograms show that cotton top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) Mhc-G sequences are closer to Homo sapiens and Pongidae than to Cercopithecinae, probably due to the stop codons existing at exon 3 of the latter. There is a clear trans-species evolution of allelism in Cercopithecinae and also in exon 2 of all the other apes studied, but a generation of allelism within each species may be present on exon 3 sequences. This discrepancy may be due to the preferential use of exon 2 over exon 3 at the mRNA splicing level within each species in order to obtain the appropriate functional G product. Mhc-G intron 2 shows conserved motifs in all species studied, particularly a 23 base pair deletion between positions 161 and 183 which is locus specific, and some of the invariant residues, important for peptide presentation, conserved in classical class I molecules from fish and reptiles to humans were not found in Mhc-G alleles; the intron 2 dendrogram also shows a particular pattern of allelism within each species. In summary, Mhc-G has substantial differences from other classical class I genes: polymorphism patterns, tissue distribution, gene structure, splicing variability, and probably an allelism variability within each species at exon 3. The G proteins may also be different. This indicates that the Mhc-G function may not be peptide presentation to the clonotypic T-cell receptor.",2.227,1723

From these substitutions and under the assumption that the orangutan and African apes diverged 13 million years ago, we obtained a divergence time for humans and chimpanzees of 4.9 million years. This divergence time permitted calibration of the synonymous substitution rate (3.89 x 10(-8)/site per year). To obtain the substitution rate in the displacement (D)-loop region, we compared the three human mtDNAs and measured the relative abundance of substitutions in the D-loop region and at synonymous sites. The estimated substitution rate in the D-loop region was 7.00 x 10(-8)/site per year.

The conventional view hypothesizes that gracilization of the human feeding system is related to a shift toward eating foods that were less mechanically challenging to consume and/or foods that were processed using tools before being ingested. This hypothesis predicts that human feeding systems should not be well-configured to produce forceful bites and that the cranium should be structurally weak. An alternate hypothesis, based on the observation that humans have mechanically efficient jaw adductors, states that the modern human face is adapted to generate and withstand high biting forces. We used finite element analysis (FEA) to test two opposing mechanical hypotheses: that compared to our closest living relative, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), the modern human craniofacial skeleton is (1) less well configured, or (2) better configured to generate and withstand high magnitude bite forces. We considered intraspecific variation in our examination of human feeding biomechanics by examining a sample of geographically diverse crania that differed notably in shape. We found that our biomechanical models of human crania had broadly similar mechanical behavior despite their shape variation and were, on average, less structurally stiff than the crania of chimpanzees during unilateral biting when loaded with physiologically-scaled muscle loads. Our results also show that modern humans are efficient producers of bite force, consistent with previous analyses. However, highly tensile reaction forces were generated at the working (biting) side jaw joint during unilateral molar bites in which the chewing muscles were recruited with bilateral symmetry. In life, such a configuration would have increased the risk of joint dislocation and constrained the maximum recruitment levels of the masticatory muscles on the balancing (non-biting) side of the head. Our results do not necessarily conflict with the hypothesis that anterior tooth (incisors, canines, premolars) biting could have been selectively important in humans, although the reduced size of the premolars in humans has been shown to increase the risk of tooth crown fracture. We interpret our results to suggest that human craniofacial evolution was probably not driven by selection for high magnitude unilateral biting, and that increased masticatory muscle efficiency in humans is likely to be a secondary byproduct of selection for some function unrelated to forceful biting behaviors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a shift to softer foods and/or the innovation of pre-oral food processing techniques relaxed selective pressures maintaining craniofacial features that favor forceful biting and chewing behaviors, leading to the characteristically small and gracile faces of modern humans.",2.112,643

It is understood that the topological information of reconstructed metabolic networks, such as modular organization, has crucial implications on biological functions. Recent interpretations of modularity in network settings provide a view of multiple network partitions induced by different resolution parameters. Here we ask the question: How do multiple network partitions affect the organization of metabolic networks? Since network motifs are often interpreted as the super families of evolved units, we further investigate their impact under multiple network partitions and investigate how the distribution of network motifs influences the organization of metabolic networks. We studied Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli metabolic networks; we analyzed the relationship between different community structures and motif distribution patterns. Further, we quantified the degree to which motifs participate in the modular organization of metabolic networks.",3.154,752

 crystallization communications",2012,"Human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent hemeprotein, whose catalytic activity is regulated by S-adenosylmethionine. CBS catalyzes the beta-replacement reaction of homocysteine (Hcy) with serine to yield cystathionine. CBS is a key regulator of plasma levels of the thrombogenic Hcy and deficiency in CBS is the single most common cause of homocystinuria, an inherited metabolic disorder of sulfur amino acids. The properties of CBS enzymes, such as domain organization, oligomerization degree or regulatory mechanisms, are not conserved across the eukaryotes. The current body of knowledge is insufficient to understand these differences and their impact on CBS function and physiology. To overcome this deficiency, we have addressed the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of a protein construct (hCBS516-525) that contains the full-length CBS from Homo sapiens (hCBS) and just lacks amino-acid residues 516-525, which are located in a disordered loop. The human enzyme yielded crystals belonging to space group I222, with unit-cell parameters a=124.98, b=136.33, c=169.83 A and diffracting X-rays to a resolution of 3.0 A.

The mitochondrial carriers ORC1, ORC2, and SLC25A29 from Homo sapiens, BAC1 and BAC2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Ort1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been biochemically characterized by transport assays in liposomes. All of them transport ornithine and amino acids with side chains terminating at least with one amine. There are, however, marked differences in their substrate specificities including their affinity for ornithine (KM values in the mM to muM range). These differences are most likely reflected by minor differences in the substrate binding sites of these carriers. The physiological role of the above-mentioned mitochondrial carriers is to link several metabolic pathways that take place partly in the cytosol and partly in the mitochondrial matrix and to provide basic amino acids for mitochondrial translation. In the liver, human ORC1 catalyzes the citrulline/ornithine exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is required for the urea cycle. Human ORC1, ORC2, and SLC25A29 are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis and transport of arginine, which can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of NO, agmatine, polyamines, creatine, glutamine, glutamate, and proline, as well as in the degradation of basic amino acids. BAC1 and BAC2 are implicated in some processes similar to those of their human counterparts and in nitrogen and amino acid metabolism linked to stress conditions and the development of plants.

The taxonomic assignment of PU-198 to H. sapiens was based predominantly on the small size of the specimen, following an analysis which found little to no overlap in premolar size between Homo erectus and terminal Pleistocene/Holocene H. sapiens. Here, we re-evaluate the use of size in the taxonomic assignment of PU-198 in light of 1) new buccolingual and mesiodistal measurements taken on the fossil, 2) comparisons to a larger sample of H. erectus and H. sapiens maxillary third premolars, and 3) evidence of a diachronic trend in post-canine dental size reduction among Javan H. erectus. Our results demonstrate PU-198 to be slightly larger than previously suggested, reveal substantial overlap in premolar size between H. erectus and H. sapiens, and indicate a statistically significant reduction in premolar size between early and late Javan H. erectus. Our findings cast doubt on the assignment of PU-198 to H. sapiens, and accordingly, question the appearance of H. sapiens on Java between 143,000 and 115,000 years ago.",3.733,6

Since last two decades the progressive rise in the alternative form of treatment cannot be ignored and population seems to be dissatisfied with the conventional treatment modalities and therefore, resort to other forms of treatment, mainly complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The use of CAM is predominantly more popular in older adults and therefore, numerous research studies and clinical trials have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of CAM in the management of both communicable and non-communicable disease. In this current mini review, we attempt to encompass the use of CAM in chronic non-communicable diseases that are most likely seen in geriatrics. The current review focuses not only on the reassurance of good health practices, emphasizing on the holistic development and strengthening the body's defense mechanisms, but also attempts to construct a pattern of self-care and patient empowerment in geriatrics. The issues of safety with CAM use cannot be sidelined and consultation with a health care professional is always advocated to the patient. Likewise, responsibility of the health care professional is to inform the patient about the safety and efficacy issues. In order to substantiate the efficacy and safety of CAMs, evidence-based studies and practices with consolidated standards should be planned and executed.",0,987

 Series B, Biological sciences",2015,"The fossil record of the human pelvis reveals the selective priorities acting on hominin anatomy at different points in our evolutionary history, during which mechanical requirements for locomotion, childbirth and thermoregulation often conflicted. In our earliest upright ancestors, fundamental alterations of the pelvis compared with non-human primates facilitated bipedal walking. Further changes early in hominin evolution produced a platypelloid birth canal in a pelvis that was wide overall, with flaring ilia. This pelvic form was maintained over 3-4 Myr with only moderate changes in response to greater habitat diversity, changes in locomotor behaviour and increases in brain size. It was not until Homo sapiens evolved in Africa and the Middle East 200 000 years ago that the narrow anatomically modern pelvis with a more circular birth canal emerged. This major change appears to reflect selective pressures for further increases in neonatal brain size and for a narrow body shape associated with heat dissipation in warm environments. The advent of the modern birth canal, the shape and alignment of which require fetal rotation during birth, allowed the earliest members of our species to deal obstetrically with increases in encephalization while maintaining a narrow body to meet thermoregulatory demands and enhance locomotor performance.",2.147,808

Biological sciences / The Royal Society,2015,"A variety of lines of evidence support the idea that neutral evolutionary processes (genetic drift, mutation) have been important in generating cranial differences between Neandertals and modern humans. But how do Neandertals and modern humans compare with other species? And how do these comparisons illuminate the evolutionary processes underlying cranial diversification? To address these questions, we used 27 standard cranial measurements collected on 2524 recent modern humans, 20 Neandertals and 237 common chimpanzees to estimate split times between Neandertals and modern humans, and between Pan troglodytes verus and two other subspecies of common chimpanzee. Consistent with a neutral divergence, the Neandertal versus modern human split-time estimates based on cranial measurements are similar to those based on DNA sequences. By contrast, the common chimpanzee cranial estimates are much lower than DNA-sequence estimates. Apparently, cranial evolution has been unconstrained in Neandertals and modern humans compared with common chimpanzees. Based on these and additional analyses, it appears that cranial differentiation in common chimpanzees has been restricted by stabilizing natural selection. Alternatively, this restriction could be due to genetic and/or developmental constraints on the amount of within-group variance (relative to effective population size) available for genetic drift to act on.",0,285

The results supported the hypothesis. Monkeys, more than humans, showed a gradual transition from same to different categories and an inclusive criterion for responding Same. The results have implications for comparing Same-Different performances across species--different species may not always construe or perform even identical tasks in the same way.

Part B, New anatomist",2006,"The cervical vertebral column bears or balances the weight of the head supported by the nuchal muscles that partly originate from the cervical vertebrae. The position of the head relative to the vertebral column, and consequently locomotion and posture behavior, could thus be associated with the form of the cervical vertebrae. In spite of this assumption and some empirical indications along these lines, primate vertebral morphologies have been reported to be very similar and not clearly related to locomotion. We therefore study the relationship between the morphology of the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, and the locomotion pattern within primates using a geometric morphometric approach. Our analysis is based on a total of 116 vertebrae of adult Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates lar, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, Ateles geoffroyi, and Alouatta palliata. On each atlas, 56 landmarks were digitized and superimposed by Procrustes registration. The resulting shape variables were analyzed by principal component analysis, multivariate regression, and partial least-squares analysis. We found that the nine primate species differ clearly in their atlas morphology and that allometric shape change is distinct between the nonhuman primates and Homo sapiens. We could further identify morphological features that relate to the species' locomotion pattern. Human atlas shape, however, cannot be predicted by an extrapolation of the nonhuman primate model. This implies that either the primate atlas is generalized enough to allow bipedal locomotion or else the human atlas morphology is a unique adaptation different from that in the more orthograde nonhuman primates.",1.542,1688

Such knowledge could be important for selection of animal models used in environmental studies. From the phylogenetic and ontogenetic point of view, a comparison between the animal and human nose is interesting. METHOD: Nose models of 5 even-toed ungulate species (he-goat, sheep, cow, roebuck, wild boar) and two humans (new born infant and adult) were examined. Anatomical and physiological features of the nasal cavities of all species were compared. All models were rinsed with water and the flow was visualized for observation. Geometric and rhinoresistometric measurements were then performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Even-toed ungulates have two turbinates directly in the main part of the nasal airflow (respiratory turbinates) and a different number of turbinates in a so-called dead space of the nasal airflow above the nasopharyngeal duct (ethmoidal turbinates). The latter correspond with the upper and middle turbinate in analogy to the human nose. Respiratory turbinates of even-toed ungulates insert immediately behind the external nasal ostium. Thus, the whole nasal cavity acts as a functional area with the exception of a small area acting as dead space only detectable in ruminants, possibly indicating a small evolutionary progress from suinae to bovidae. The shape of the animal nasal cavity is stretched and flat. The airflow runs nearly completely turbulent through the nose. The nasal cavity in the adult human is relatively short and high. The area between the external nasal ostium and the head of the inferior turbinate is called inflow area. It distributes the airflow over the whole nasal cross section and generates a turbulent flow. So the airflow is prepared to contact the mucosa in the functional area (turbinate area). The morphology of the inflow area is approximately formed by the shape of the external nose. The nasal cavity of a newborn child is also stretched and flat and more similar to the nasal shape of the investigated animals. The inflow area in the newborn nose is not yet developed and corresponds with the growing external newborn nose. One can hypothesize that the inflow area in human noses is a morphological adaptation in the changed length-height-ratio of the nasal cavity.",3.761,181

However, the mechanisms by which maternal effect genes regulate mammalian early embryonic development remain largely unknown. Recently, we identified a subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) that is composed of at least four proteins encoded by Mater, Floped, Tle6 and Filia and is critical for mouse preimplantation development. The present study demonstrates that human SCMC homologous genes (NLRP5, OOEP, TLE6 and KHDC3L) are specifically expressed in the oocytes of human fetal ovaries. The proteins of this complex co-localize in the subcortex of human oocytes and early embryos. Furthermore, the SCMC proteins physically interact with each other when they are co-expressed in cell lines. These results indicate that human NLRP5, OOEP, TLE6 and KHDC3L function as a complex in the oocytes and early embryos of Homo sapiens. Considering the important roles of the SCMC in mouse early embryogenesis, the characterization of the human SCMC will provide a basis for investigating human early embryonic development and will have clinical implications in human female infertility or recurrent spontaneous abortion.",3.747,795

Therefore, knowledge on the origin of these functionalities provides a better understanding of the domain and protein evolution in human. The lack of proper comprehension about such origin has impelled us to study the evolutionary origin of human proteome in a unique way as detailed in this study. RESULTS: This study reports a unique approach for understanding the evolution of human proteome by tracing the origin of its constituting domains hierarchically, along the Homo sapiens lineage. The uniqueness of this method lies in subtractive searching of functional and conserved domains in the human proteome resulting in higher efficiency of detecting their origins. From these analyses the nature of protein evolution and trends in domain evolution can be observed in the context of the entire human proteome data. The method adopted here also helps delineate the degree of divergence of functional families occurred during the course of evolution. CONCLUSION: This approach to trace the evolutionary origin of functional domains in the human proteome facilitates better understanding of their functional versatility as well as provides insights into the functionality of hypothetical proteins present in the human proteome. This work elucidates the origin of functional and conserved domains in human proteins, their distribution along the Homo sapiens lineage, occurrence frequency of different domain combinations and proteome-wide patterns of their distribution, providing insights into the evolutionary solution to the increased complexity of the human proteome.",3.368,1561

The sample included 160 recent Homo sapiens, 28 Upper Paleolithic H. sapiens, 10 early H. sapiens, and 33 H. neanderthalensis (Neandertal) individuals. Of these, 97 were dm(2) /M(1) pairs from the same individuals. A two-block partial least squares analysis of paired individuals revealed a significant correlation in crown shape between dm(2) and M(1) . A principal component analysis confirmed that Neandertal and H. sapiens dm(2) and M(1) shapes differ significantly and that this difference is primarily related to hypocone size and projection. Allometry accounted for a small but significant proportion of the total morphological variance. We found the magnitude of the allometric effect to be significantly stronger in Neandertals than in H. sapiens. Procrustes distances were significantly different between the two tooth classes in Neandertals, but not among H. sapiens groups. Nevertheless, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the two species share the same allometric trajectory. Although size clearly contributes to the unique shape of the Neandertal dm(2) and M(1) , the largest H. sapiens teeth do not exhibit the most Neandertal-like morphology. Hence, additional factors must contribute to the differences in dm(2) and M(1) crown shape between these two species. We suggest an investigation of the role of timing and rate of development on the shapes of the dm(2) and M(1) may provide further answers.",2.379,198

Our text-mining system recognizes over 640,000 biomedical concepts: some are specific (i.e., names of genes or proteins) others generic (e.g., 'Homo sapiens'). Generic concepts may play important roles in automated information retrieval, extraction, and inference but may also result in concept overload and confound retrieval and reasoning with low-relevance or even spurious links. Here, we attempted to optimize the retrieval performance for protein-protein interactions (PPI) by filtering generic concepts (node filtering) or links to generic concepts (edge filtering) from a weighted semantic network. First, we defined metrics based on network properties that quantify the specificity of concepts. Then using these metrics, we systematically filtered generic information from the network while monitoring retrieval performance of known protein-protein interactions. We also systematically filtered specific information from the network (inverse filtering), and assessed the retrieval performance of networks composed of generic information alone. RESULTS: Filtering generic or specific information induced a two-phase response in retrieval performance: initially the effects of filtering were minimal but beyond a critical threshold network performance suddenly drops. Contrary to expectations, networks composed exclusively of generic information demonstrated retrieval performance comparable to unfiltered networks that also contain specific concepts. Furthermore, an analysis using individual generic concepts demonstrated that they can effectively support the retrieval of known protein-protein interactions. For instance the concept",3.234,1617

This gracility predisposes contemporary humans to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. Explanations for this gracility include reduced levels of physical activity, the dissipation of load through enlarged joint surfaces, and selection for systemic physiological characteristics that differentiate modern humans from other primates. This study considered the skeletal remains of four behaviorally diverse recent human populations and a large sample of extant primates to assess variation in trabecular bone structure in the human hip joint. Proximal femur trabecular bone structure was quantified from microCT data for 229 individuals from 31 extant primate taxa and 59 individuals from four distinct archaeological human populations representing sedentary agriculturalists and mobile foragers. Analyses of mass-corrected trabecular bone variables reveal that the forager populations had significantly higher bone volume fraction, thicker trabeculae, and consequently lower relative bone surface area compared with the two agriculturalist groups. There were no significant differences between the agriculturalist and forager populations for trabecular spacing, number, or degree of anisotropy. These results reveal a correspondence between human behavior and bone structure in the proximal femur, indicating that more highly mobile human populations have trabecular bone structure similar to what would be expected for wild nonhuman primates of the same body mass.

The NBD-p53 motif complex enhances the p53 stabilization, thereby increasing the tumor suppression activity in cancer treatment. Therefore, we identified the interaction between NBD and p53 using STRING version 9.1 program. Then, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of p53 motif through homology modeling and determined the binding affinity and stability of NBD-p53 motif complex structure via molecular docking and dynamics (MD) simulation. Human DNA binding domain of p53 motif (SCMGGMNR) retrieved from UniProt (UniProtKB: P04637) was docked with the NBD protein, using the Autodock version 4.2 program. The binding energy and intermolecular energy for the NBD-p53 motif complex were -0.44 Kcal/mol and -9.90 Kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, RMSD, RMSF, hydrogen bonds, salt bridge, and secondary structure analyses revealed that the NBD protein had a strong bond with p53 motif and the protein-ligand complex was stable. Thus, the current data would be highly encouraging for designing Hsp70 structure based drug in cancer therapy.",0.953,907

 States of America",2012,"Human centromeres are defined by megabases of homogenous alpha-satellite DNA arrays that are packaged into specialized chromatin marked by the centromeric histone variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A). Although most human chromosomes have a single higher-order repeat (HOR) array of alpha satellites, several chromosomes have more than one HOR array. Homo sapiens chromosome 17 (HSA17) has two juxtaposed HOR arrays, D17Z1 and D17Z1-B. Only D17Z1 has been linked to CENP-A chromatin assembly. Here, we use human artificial chromosome assembly assays to show that both D17Z1 and D17Z1-B can support de novo centromere assembly independently. We extend these in vitro studies and demonstrate, using immunostaining and chromatin analyses, that in human cells the centromere can be assembled at D17Z1 or D17Z1-B. Intriguingly, some humans are functional heterozygotes, meaning that CENP-A is located at a different HOR array on the two HSA17 homologs. The site of CENP-A assembly on HSA17 is stable and is transmitted through meiosis, as evidenced by inheritance of CENP-A location through multigenerational families. Differences in histone modifications are not linked clearly with active and inactive D17Z1 and D17Z1-B arrays; however, we detect a correlation between the presence of variant repeat units of D17Z1 and CENP-A assembly at the opposite array, D17Z1-B. Our studies reveal the presence of centromeric epialleles on an endogenous human chromosome and suggest genomic complexities underlying the mechanisms that determine centromere identity in humans.",9.674,1266

Although these exercises were designed to supplement and enhance classroom instruction on phylogeny, cladistics, and systematics in the context of a postsecondary majors-level introductory biology course, the activities themselves require very little prior student exposure to these topics. Thus, they are well suited for students in a wide range of educational levels, including a biology class at the secondary level. In implementing this exercise, we have observed measurable gains, both in student comprehension of molecular phylogeny and in their acceptance of modern evolutionary theory.

It behaves as a suppressor of prostate cancer development by restricting cell cycle progression and implicating a possible protective role against tumor formation. On the basis of the above report, we selected 15-LOX-2 protein to study the structural classification and functional relationship with associated protein network at computational level. Sequence alignment and protein functional study shows that it contains a highly conserved LOX motif. PLAT domain with PF01477 and LH2 domain with PF00305 were successfully observed. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (PDB ID: 3O8Y) was selected as a template with 42% identity. 3D structure was successfully predicted and verified. Qualitative analysis suggests that the predicted model was reliable and stable with best quality. Quantitative study shows that the model contained expected volume and area with best resolution.

We propose a method for detecting past positive selection through ongoing negative selection, based on comparison of the parameters of intraspecies polymorphism at functionally important and selectively neutral sites where a nucleotide substitution of the same kind occurred recently. Reduced occurrence of recently replaced ancestral alleles at functionally important sites indicates that negative selection currently acts against these alleles and, therefore, that their replacements were driven by positive selection. Application of this method to the Drosophila melanogaster lineage shows that the fraction of adaptive amino acid replacements remained approximately 0.5 for a long time. In the Homo sapiens lineage, however, this fraction drops from approximately 0.5 before the Ponginae-Homininae divergence to approximately 0 after it. The proposed method is based on essentially the same data as the McDonald-Kreitman test but is free from some of its limitations, which may open new opportunities, especially when many genotypes within a species are known.",4.229,1580

21228547,Gorilla and orangutan brains conform to the primate cellular scaling rules: implications for human evolution.,"['Herculano-Houzel S', 'Kaas JH']","Brain, behavior and evolution",2011,"Gorillas and orangutans are primates at least as large as humans, but their brains amount to about one third of the size of the human brain. This discrepancy has been used as evidence that the human brain is about 3 times larger than it should be for a primate species of its body size. In contrast to the view that the human brain is special in its size, we have suggested that it is the great apes that might have evolved bodies that are unusually large, on the basis of our recent finding that the cellular composition of the human brain matches that expected for a primate brain of its size, making the human brain a linearly scaled-up primate brain in its number of cells. To investigate whether the brain of great apes also conforms to the primate cellular scaling rules identified previously, we determine the numbers of neuronal and other cells that compose the orangutan and gorilla cerebella, use these numbers to calculate the size of the brain and of the cerebral cortex expected for these species, and show that these match the sizes described in the literature. Our results suggest that the brains of great apes also scale linearly in their numbers of neurons like other primate brains, including humans. The conformity of great apes and humans to the linear cellular scaling rules that apply to other primates that diverged earlier in primate evolution indicates that prehistoric Homo species as well as other hominins must have had brains that conformed to the same scaling rules, irrespective of their body size. We then used those scaling rules and published estimated brain volumes for various hominin species to predict the numbers of neurons that composed their brains. We predict that Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis had brains with approximately 80 billion neurons, within the range of variation found in modern Homo sapiens. We propose that while the cellular scaling rules that apply to the primate brain have remained stable in hominin evolution (since they apply to simians, great apes and modern humans alike), the Colobinae and Pongidae lineages favored marked increases in body size rather than brain size from the common ancestor with the Homo lineage, while the Homo lineage seems to have favored a large brain instead of a large body, possibly due to the metabolic limitations to having both.",2.013,1236

Here we show that modern human head lice, Pediculus humanus, are composed of two ancient lineages, whose origin predates modern Homo sapiens by an order of magnitude (ca. 1.18 million years). One of the two louse lineages has a worldwide distribution and appears to have undergone a population bottleneck ca. 100,000 years ago along with its modern H. sapiens host. Phylogenetic and population genetic data suggest that the other lineage, found only in the New World, has remained isolated from the worldwide lineage for the last 1.18 million years. The ancient divergence between these two lice is contemporaneous with splits among early species of Homo, and cospeciation analyses suggest that the two louse lineages codiverged with a now extinct species of Homo and the lineage leading to modern H. sapiens. If these lice indeed codiverged with their hosts ca. 1.18 million years ago, then a recent host switch from an archaic species of Homo to modern H. sapiens is required to explain the occurrence of both lineages on modern H. sapiens.

However, the precise global gene expression alterations caused by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in the cardiovascular system need to be further elucidated. In this study, we profiled the gene expression of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to different concentrations of TCDD by high-throughput sequencing. Expression of 1,838 genes was changed significantly after TCDD stimulation. The FunDO analysis suggested that some CVDs were highly associated with TCDD treatment, including atherosclerosis, thromboangiitis obliterans, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and hypertension. KEGG pathway analysis showed that many genes in the signaling pathways of vascular smooth muscle contraction and apoptosis were altered distinctly. In addition, we revealed evidence regarding the gene network changes of chronic CVDs including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension, and PAH in TCDD-exposed HUVECs. We found that gene expression of beta1-adrenoceptors (ADRB1), beta2-adrenoceptors (ADRB2), endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1), and endothelin-1 gene (EDN1) that are involved in the blood pressure regulation pathway decreased apparently under TCDD treatment. Moreover, the transcripts of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), which are related to atherosclerosis, were up-regulated by TCDD stimulation. In addition, the transcripts of Homo sapiens collagen, type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1), and isoforms that trigger the MI pathway were up-regulated after TCDD exposure.

The cDNA sequence of ec-kifc3 had a full-length of 3033bp, including a 260bp 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), a 445bp 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and an open reading frame that encoded a 775-amino-acid protein. Additionally, the calculated molecular weight of the putative ec-KIFC3 was 87kDa and its estimated isoelectric point was 6.18. Structurally, the putative ec-KIFC3 had three domains: head domain, neck domain and tail domain. Protein alignment demonstrated that ec-KIFC3 had 47.2%, 67.8%, 68.8%, 69.3% and 76.8% identity with its homologues in Xenopus laevis, Mus musculus, Cricetulus griseus, Homo sapiens, and Gallus gallus. The phylogenetic analysis showed that ec-KIFC3 was more related to KIFC3 in vertebrates than invertebrates. Tissue expression results showed the presence of ec-KIFC3 in various tissues with its highest expression in the testis. In situ hybridization demonstrated that ec-KIFC3 mRNA was distributed around the nucleus in early and middle stage spermatids and expressed in the nucleus in the elongating spermatids during spermiogenesis. Besides, the ec-KIFC3 mRNA was expressed in the acrosome of the developmental spermatids.

This article highlights some of the current progress and open questions in nutrition-related areas of microbiome research. It also underscores the metabolic capabilities of microbial fermentation on nutritional substrates that require further mechanistic understanding and systems biology approaches of studying functional interactions between diet composition, gut microbiota, and host metabolism. Questions surrounding bacterial fermentation and degradation of dietary constituents (particularly by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) and deciphering how microbial encoding of enzymes and derived metabolites affect recovery of dietary energy by the host are more complex than previously thought. Moreover, it is essential to understand to what extent the intestinal microbiota is subject to dietary control and to integrate these data with functional metabolic signatures and biomarkers. Many lines of research have demonstrated the significant role of the gut microbiota in human physiology and disease. Probiotic and prebiotic products are proliferating in the market in response to consumer demand, and the science and technology around these products are progressing rapidly. With high-throughput molecular technologies driving the science, studying the bidirectional interactions of host-microbial cometabolism, epithelial cell maturation, shaping of innate immune development, normal vs. dysfunctional nutrient absorption and processing, and the complex signaling pathways involved is now possible.

Reinforcement was contingent on responding (approaching the food well) to the nine medium-durations range tones (56-255 ms) but not to the nine short-durations range (10-46 ms) or long-durations range tones (309-1420 ms). Rats also received post-discrimination transfer tests with 2 kHz and 4 kHz tones that varied over the same durations as the 3 kHz tones. Rats acquired the temporal discrimination to a slightly lower level of accuracy than seen in finches or humans by Weisman et al. (1999). We tested for transfer of the temporal discrimination to find that rats, similar to humans (data from Weisman et al., 1999), transferred to untrained 2-kHz and 4-kHz tones at levels approaching accuracy to that achieved to the trained 3-kHz tone. By contrast, zebra finches (data from Weisman et al., 1999) failed to transfer their discrimination to the trained tone. We conclude that (a) rats discriminate among tone durations at least as well as they do among auditory frequencies and (b) rats like humans, but unlike finches, are insensitive to absolute pitch in their temporal discrimination.",1.567,440

Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) together with splicing the EST sequence from a haemocyte cDNA liary, we found that Hs-BTG1 contains a 525 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 174 amino-acid polypeptide, a 306 bp 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), and a 571 bp 3' UTR with a Poly(A) tail as well as a transcription termination signal (AATAAA). Homologue searching against GenBank revealed that Hs-BTG1 was closest to Crassostrea gigas BTG1, sharing 50.57% of protein identities. Hs-BTG1 also shares some typical features of the BTG/TOB family, possessing two well-conserved A and B boxes. Clustering analysis of Hs-BTG1 and other known BTGs showed that Hs-BTG1 was also closely related to BTG1 of C. gigas from the inverteate BTG1 clade. Function prediction via homology modeling showed that both Hs-BTG1 and C. gigas BTG1 share a similar three-dimensional structure with Homo sapiens BTG1. Tissue-specific expression analysis of the Hs-BTG1 via real-time PCR showed that the transcripts were constitutively expressed, with the highest levels in the hepatopancreas and gills, and the lowest in both haemocyte and muscle tissue.

This indicates that not only human infants, but also chimpanzee infants formed categorical representations of a global-like level. Implications for the shared origins and species-specificity of categorization abilities, and the cognitive operations underlying categorization, are discussed.",3.808,488

METHODS: Colonic mucosal pinch biopsies from the descending part were obtained endoscopically from patients with active UC or CD, quiescent UC or CD, as well as healthy controls. Total RNA was isolated and miRNA expression assessed using the miRNA microarray Geniom Biochip miRNA Homo sapiens (Febit GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Data analysis was carried out by principal component analysis and projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis using the SIMCA-P+12 software package (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The microarray data were subsequently validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) performed on colonic tissue samples from active UC patients (n = 20), patients with quiescent UC (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 20). The qPCR results were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. In silico prediction analysis were performed to identify potential miRNA target genes and the predicted miRNA targets were then compared with all UC associated susceptibility genes reported in the literature. RESULTS: The colonic mucosal miRNA transcriptome differs significantly between UC and controls, UC and CD, as well as between UC patients with mucosal inflammation and those without. However, no clear differences in the transcriptome of patients with CD and controls were found. The miRNAs with the strongest differential power were identified (miR-20b, miR-99a, miR-203, miR-26b, and miR-98) and found to be up-regulated more than a 10-fold in active UC as compared to quiescent UC, CD, and controls. Two miRNAs, miR-125b-1* and let-7e*, were up-regulated more than 5-fold in quiescent UC compared to active UC, CD, and controls. Four of the seven miRNAs (miR-20b, miR-98, miR-125b-1*, and let-7e*) were validated by qPCR and found to be specifically upregulated in patients with UC. Using in silico analysis we found several predicted pro-inflammatory target genes involved in various pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and cytokine signaling, which are both key signaling pathways in UC. CONCLUSION: The present study provides the first evidence that miR-20b, miR-98, miR-125b-1*, and let-7e* are deregulated in patients with UC. The level of these miRNAs may serve as new potential biomarkers for this chronic disease.",2.369,1107

In this study, we investigated hLHX6.1 (an isoform of hLHX6), which functions as a tumor suppressor gene in the cervix. Firstly, the methylation levels of the hLHX6 and hLHX6.1 promoters were investigated in 8 cervical cancer cell lines and human tissue samples with a distinctive degree of malignant transformation. In spite of the presence of multiple cytosine guanine dinucleotides (CpG islands) in 2 proximal promoters of the hLHX6 and hLHX6.1 genes, only the hLHX6.1 promoters were found to be mostly hypermethylated and associated with transcriptional silencing by promoter methylation, whereas the hLHX6 promoters were not. Methylation levels in the hLHX6.1 promoter were also found to be strongly related to cervical cancer development. The level of hLHX6.1 gene expression was found to be relatively high in normal cells, in which the hLHX6.1 promoter was mostly unmethylated. However, the hLHX6.1 gene expression was down-regulated or undetectable in cervical cancer cell lines and cancer tissues, in which the hLHX6.1 promoter was hypermethylated. This epigenetic alteration in the hLHX6.1 promoter begins at a relatively early stage, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for the early diagnosis and prevention of cervical cancer. Moreover, the overexpression of the hLHX6.1 gene in cervical cancer cells suppressed the tumorigenic phenotype, as shown by soft agar colony formation and migration assays, suggesting that hLHX6.1 could be a new tumor suppressor gene in the cervix.",3.025,1548

Comparisons were made with a large sample of early groups of the genus Homo to assess primitive, derived, and unique craniofacial traits of LB1 and discuss its evolution. Principal cranial shape differences between H. floresiensis and Homo sapiens are also explored metrically. The LB1 specimen exhibits a marked reductive trend in its facial skeleton, which is comparable to the H. sapiens condition and is probably associated with reduced masticatory stresses. However, LB1 is craniometrically different from H. sapiens showing an extremely small overall cranial size, and the combination of a primitive low and anteriorly narrow vault shape, a relatively prognathic face, a rounded oval foramen that is greatly separated anteriorly from the carotid canal/jugular foramen, and a unique, tall orbital shape. Whereas the neurocranium of LB1 is as small as that of some Homo habilis specimens, it exhibits laterally expanded parietals, a weak suprameatal crest, a moderately flexed occipital, a marked facial reduction, and many other derived features that characterize post-habilis Homo. Other craniofacial characteristics of LB1 include, for example, a relatively narrow frontal squama with flattened right and left sides, a marked frontal keel, posteriorly divergent temporal lines, a posteriorly flexed anteromedial corner of the mandibular fossa, a bulbous lateral end of the supraorbital torus, and a forward protruding maxillary body with a distinct infraorbital sulcus. LB1 is most similar to early Javanese Homo erectus from Sangiran and Trinil in these and other aspects. We conclude that the craniofacial morphology of LB1 is consistent with the hypothesis that H. floresiensis evolved from early Javanese H. erectus with dramatic island dwarfism. However, further field discoveries of early hominin skeletal remains from Flores and detailed analyses of the finds are needed to understand the evolutionary history of this endemic hominin species.",3.733,264

In a bioinformatics approach, we now identified a new family of protein sequences from animals, plants, and fungi and characterized these sequences biochemically by expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This resulted in the identification of the enzyme sphingolipid Delta4-desaturase (dihydroceramide desaturase) from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Candida albicans, in addition to a bifunctional sphingolipid Delta4-desaturase/C-4-hydroxylase from M. musculus. Among the sequences investigated are the Homo sapiens membrane lipid desaturase, the M. musculus degenerative spermatocyte, and the Drosophila melanogaster degenerative spermatocyte proteins. During spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis of des mutant flies, both cell cycle and spermatid differentiation are specifically blocked at the entry into the first meiotic division, leading to male sterility. This mutant phenotype can be restored to wild-type by complementation with a functional copy of the des gene (Endo, K., Akiyama, T., Kobayashi S., and Okada, M. (1996) Mol. Gen. Genet. 253, 157-165). These results suggest that Delta4-desaturated sphingolipids provide an early signal necessary to trigger the entry into both meiotic and spermatid differentiation pathways during Drosophila spermatogenesis.",0,1762

Given the abundance of potentially confounding evolutionary and mechanical factors influencing pelvic form, it is important to tease apart the effects of shape and size in the major component of the primate pelvis, the os coxae. However, os coxae form is difficult to assess via traditional morphometric methods. Here, we adopt a 3D geometric morphometric approach to landmark data. Our analyses included data from 30 extant catarrhine taxa. Data were transformed and registered using Procrustes analysis and analyzed via examination of principal components. Two analyses were performed: one excluding Homo sapiens, and a second including them. Results of the first analysis demonstrate that the total diversity of os coxae morphology is significantly greater in hominoids than it is in cercopithecoids. This appears to be driven by the greater effects of size diversity (i.e., allometric effects) in the case of the hominoids. This analysis also revealed a clear taxonomic/phylogenetic distinction between hominoids and cercopithecoids in terms of os coxae shape. The second analysis showed that Procrustes distances in shape space are significantly greater between extant Pan and Homo than they are between any two non-human catarrhine taxa. This analysis thus quantifies, on a comparative basis, the dramatic effect that the course of hominin evolution had upon the morphology of the human pelvis, within what is - even by catarrhine standards--a relatively short span of evolutionary time.",3.733,1060

In the northeastern United States, EEE virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving the ornithophilic mosquito, Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) and passerine birds in freshwater swamp habitats. To evaluate the role of Cs. melanura and Culiseta morsitans (Theobald) in recent episodes of EEE virus activity in Massachusetts, we collected blood-fed mosquitoes between June, 2007, and October, 2008, from virus foci in 6 counties, and identified the source of blood meals by PCR amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and sequencing. Analysis of 529 Cs. melanura and 25 Cs. morsitans revealed that nearly 99% and 96% of mosquitoes, respectively, acquired blood meals solely from avian hosts. American Robin, Turdus migratorius Linnaeus was identified as the most common vertebrate host for Cs. melanura (21.7%, n=115), followed by Tufted Titmouse, Baeolophus bicolor (L.)

A comparative metabolic pathway analysis of the host Homo sapiens and the pathogen M. tuberculosis H37Rv has been performed with three level of analysis. In first level, the unique metabolic pathways of M. tuberculosis have been identified through its comparative study with H. sapiens and identification of non-homologous proteins has been done through BLAST similarity search. In second level, choke-point analysis has been performed with identified non-homologous proteins of metabolic pathways. In third level, two type of analysis have been performed through protein interaction network. First analysis has been done to find out the most potential metabolic functional associations among all identified choke point proteins whereas second analysis has been performed to find out the functional association of high metabolic interacting proteins to pathogenesis causing proteins. Most interactive metabolic proteins which have highest number of functional association with pathogenesis causing proteins have been considered as potential drug target. A list of 18 potential drug targets has been proposed which are various stages of progress at the TBSGC and proposed drug targets are also studied for other pathogenic strains.

An increase in XYLT1 mRNA expression and serum XT activity is associated with diseases characterized by abnormal extracellular matrix accumulation like, for instance, fibrosis. Nevertheless, physiological and pathological mechanisms of transcriptional XT regulation remain elusive. RESULTS: To elucidate whether promoter variations might affect the naturally occurring variability in serum XT activity, a complete sequence analysis of the XYLT1 promoter was performed in genomic DNA of healthy blood donors. Based on promoter amplification by a specialized PCR technique, sequence analysis revealed a fragment of 238 bp, termed XYLT1 238*, which has never been described in the human XYLT1 reference sequence so far. In silico characterization of this unconsidered fragment depicted an evolutionary conservation between sequences of Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) or Mus musculus (mouse), respectively. Promoter activity studies indicated that XYLT1 238* harbors various transcription factor binding sites affecting basal XYLT1 expression and inducibility by transforming growth factor-beta1, the key fibrotic mediator. A microsatellite and two single nucleotide variants (SNV), c.-403C>T and c.-1088C>A, were identified and genotyped in 100 healthy blood donors. Construct associated changes in XYLT1 promoter activity were detected for several sequence variants, whereas serum XT activity was only marginally affected. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe for the first time the entire XYLT1 promoter sequence and provide new insights into transcriptional regulation of XT-I. Future studies should analyze the impact of regulatory XYLT1 promoter variations on XT-associated diseases.",2.397,859

Humans exhibited faster response times in the trials in which the gestural cue signalled the target location (valid trials) as opposed to the opposite location (invalid trials) when the cue-target interval (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA) was 100 ms but not when the SOA was 500 ms. However, chimpanzees showed faster response times in valid trials than in invalid trials only when the SOA was 500 ms. The reflexive mechanism is known to activate attention quickly, while the slow onset of the cueing effect can be considered a sign of voluntary control of attentional shift. The present study used the cueing paradigm and a comparative cognitive perspective to clarify the effect of directional gestural cues for the first time. The results suggested that different mechanisms underlie the attentional shift triggered by gestural cues in humans and chimpanzees.",2.582,337

In 1964 the formulation of the central paradox of psychosis by Huxley, Mayr and co-authors and the subsequent critique by Kuttner et al. of the solution Huxley et al. had offered opened up evolutionary approaches to aetiology. Here it is argued that a resolution of this paradox requires identification of the speciation event for modern H. sapiens and elucidation of its neuroanatomical and physiological consequences. It necessitates a saltational account of species transitions and the recognition of species-specific genetic variation. Pursuit of these objectives leads to the hypothesis that speciation events occur selectively on the heterogametic chromosome (the Y in mammals) and are followed by a phase of sexual selection to establish a new specific mate recognition system. In H. sapiens the core component of this system is the capacity for language; the nuclear symptoms of schizophrenia are necessary clues to its neural structure.",3.689,1823

Much of the initial characterization of the circadian system has focused on transcriptional initiation, but it is now apparent that considerable regulation is exerted after this key regulatory step. Transcript processing, protein stability, and cofactor availability have all been reported to influence circadian rhythms in a variety of species. We used a genetic screen to identify a mutation within a putative RNA binding protein (spliceosomal timekeeper locus1 [STIPL1]) that induces a long circadian period phenotype under constant conditions. STIPL1 is a homolog of the spliceosomal proteins TFP11 (Homo sapiens) and Ntr1p (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) involved in spliceosome disassembly. Analysis of general and alternative splicing using a high-resolution RT-PCR system revealed that mutation of this protein causes less efficient splicing of most but not all of the introns analyzed. In particular, the altered accumulation of circadian-associated transcripts may contribute to the observed mutant phenotype. Interestingly, mutation of a close homolog of STIPL1, STIP-LIKE2, does not cause a circadian phenotype, which suggests divergence in function between these family members. Our work highlights the importance of posttranscriptional control within the clock mechanism.",0,1290

In this study we introduce a new paradigm, the hybrid delay task, which combines an initial delay choice with a subsequent delay maintenance stage. This allows testing how often choosing to wait is paired with the actual ability to do so. We tested 18 capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) from two laboratories in various conditions, and we found that subjects frequently chose the delayed reward but then failed to wait for it, due to poor delay maintenance. However, performance improved with experience and different behavioral responses for error correction were evident. These findings have far reaching implications: if such a high error rate was observed also in other species (possibly including Homo sapiens), this may indicate that delay choice tasks that make use of salient, prepotent stimuli do not reliably assess generalized self-control, insofar as choosing to wait does not entail always being able to do so.",1.567,1166

Two hundred male and female college students were assigned to one of four odor conditions (androstenone, methyl anthranilate, skatole, and a no-odor control) and were asked to rate photographs of a male stimulus and to rate their own mood in the presence of each odorant. There was a significant overall sex by treatment condition interaction. Men in the androstenone condition rated the stimulus male as more passive, and women in the androstenone condition rated themselves as less sexy; these effects were specific to the androstenone condition.",1.52,511

However, the absence of immediate advantages, if true, would leave adult play (costly but maintained by evolution, spanning lemurs to Homo sapiens) unexplained. Although a commonly held view maintains that play is limited by stress, an emergent hypothesis states that play can regulate stress in the short term. Here we explored this hypothesis in a captive family group of New World monkeys, Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset). We observed six subjects and gathered data on aggressive, play, and scratching behavior via focal (6 h/individual) and all occurrences sampling (115 h). We found that play levels were highest during pre-feeding, the period of maximum anxiety due to the forthcoming competition over food. Scratching (the most reliable indicator of stress in primates) and play showed opposite trends along hierarchy, with dominants scratching more and playing less than subordinates. Finally, scratching decreased after play, whereas play appeared to be unrelated to previous scratching events, symptoms of a potential stressful state. In conclusion, both play timing and hierarchical distribution indicate that play limits stress, more than vice versa, at least in the short term.",0,1569

Temporal bone pneumatization has been widely studied in great apes and in early hominids. However, this feature is rarely examined in the later hominids, particularly in Asian Homo erectus. We provide a comparative morphological and quantitative analysis of Asian Homo erectus from the sites of Ngandong, Sambungmacan, and Zhoukoudian, and of Neandertals and anatomically modern Homo sapiens in order to discuss causes and modalities of temporal bone pneumatization during hominid evolution. The evolution of temporal bone pneumatization in the genus Homo is more complex than previously described. Indeed, the Zhoukoudian fossils have a unique pattern of temporal bone pneumatization, whereas Ngandong and Sambungmacan fossils, as well as the Neandertals, more closely resemble the modern human pattern. Moreover, these Chinese fossils are characterized by a wide midvault and a relatively narrow occipital bone. Our results support the point of view that cell development does not play an active role in determining cranial base morphology. Instead, pneumatization is related to available space and to temporal bone morphology, and its development is related to correlated morphology and the relative disposition of the bones and cerebral lobes. Because variation in pneumatization is extensive within the same species, the phyletic implications of pneumatization are limited in the taxa considered here.",3.733,1214

These organisms typically possess multiple Rho paralogues and numerous downstream effectors, consistent with the highly complex contributions of Rho proteins to cellular physiology. By contrast, trypanosomatids have a much simpler Rho-signaling system, and the Trypanosoma brucei genome contains only a single divergent Rho-related gene, TbRHP (Tb927.10.6240). Further, only a single RhoGAP-like protein (Tb09.160.4180) is annotated, contrasting with the >70 Rho GAP proteins from Homo sapiens. We wished to establish the function(s) of TbRHP and if Tb09.160.4180 is a potential GAP for this protein. METHODS/FINDINGS: TbRHP represents an evolutionarily restricted member of the Rho GTPase clade and is likely trypanosomatid restricted. TbRHP is expressed in both mammalian and insect dwelling stages of T. brucei and presents with a diffuse cytoplasmic location and is excluded from the nucleus. RNAi ablation of TbRHP results in major cell cycle defects and accumulation of multi-nucleated cells, coinciding with a loss of detectable mitotic spindles. Using yeast two hybrid analysis we find that TbRHP interacts with both Tb11.01.3180 (TbRACK), a homolog of Rho-kinase, and the sole trypanosome RhoGAP protein Tb09.160.4180, which is related to human OCRL. CONCLUSIONS: Despite minimization of the Rho pathway, TbRHP retains an important role in spindle formation, and hence mitosis, in trypanosomes. TbRHP is a partner for TbRACK and an OCRL-related trypanosome Rho-GAP.",3.234,1622

Most investigators agree that our species arose in Africa and subsequently spread out to occupy much of Eurasia. Researchers have argued that populations expanded along the Indian Ocean rim at ca 60,000 years ago during a single rapid dispersal event, probably employing a coastal route towards Australasia. Archaeologists have been relatively silent about the movement and expansion of human populations in terrestrial environments along the Indian Ocean rim, although it is clear that Homo sapiens reached Australia by ca 45,000 years ago. Here, we synthesize and document current genetic and archaeological evidence from two major landmasses, the Arabian peninsula and the Indian subcontinent, regions that have been underplayed in the story of out of Africa dispersals. We suggest that modern humans were present in Arabia and South Asia earlier than currently believed, and probably coincident with the presence of Homo sapiens in the Levant between ca 130 and 70,000 years ago. We show that climatic and environmental fluctuations during the Late Pleistocene would have had significant demographic effects on Arabian and South Asian populations, though indigenous populations would have responded in different ways. Based on a review of the current genetic, archaeological and environmental data, we indicate that demographic patterns in Arabia and South Asia are more interesting and complex than surmised to date.",1.273,177

 States of America",2011,"NhaA, a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter critical for pH and Na(+) homeostasis in Escherichia coli, as well as other enterobacteria and possibly Homo sapiens, was modified for fluorescence spectroscopy by constructing a functional Trp-less NhaA mutant. Purified Trp-less NhaA lacks the Trp fluorescence emission characteristic of the wild type, thereby providing a background for studying structure-function relationships in NhaA by site-directed Trp fluorescence. Two single-Trp variants in the Trp-less background (F136W and F339W) were constructed. The mutants grow on selective media, have antiport activities that are similar to Trp-less NhaA, and exhibit Trp fluorescence with three different reversible responses to Li(+), Na(+), and/or pH. With single Trp/F136W, a pH shift from pH 6.0 to 8.5 induces a red shift and dramatically increases fluorescence in a reversible fashion; no effect is observed when either Na(+) or Li(+) is added. In marked contrast, with single Trp/F339W, changes in pH do not alter fluorescence, but addition of either Na(+) or Li(+) drastically quenches fluorescence at alkaline pH. Therefore, a Trp at position 136 specifically monitors a pH-induced conformational change that activates NhaA, whereas a Trp at position 339 senses a ligand-induced conformational change that does not occur until NhaA is activated at alkaline pH.",9.674,1504

Yet artifice depends on the skills of its creator, so that it is when coming close to nature that danger surfaces. Invasive species are natural, and the havoc they create is here to call for some modesty in the appraisal of our endeavours. The farther away, the less dangerous. Being distant from man, engineered plants are considerably less harmful than animal constructs, especially those that are close to man and meant for medical use. This reality contrasts with popular belief.

In particular, some of these measures are face size dependent and show only weak sexual dimorphism, which limits the ability to identify the relationship between masculinization and attractiveness. Here, the authors show that eye-mouth-eye (EME) angle is a quantitative and face size independent trait that is sexually dimorphic and a good indicator of masculinity and face symmetry. Using frontal photographs of female and male faces, the authors first confirmed that the EME angle (measured with the vertex in the middle of the mouth and the arms crossing the centers of pupils) was highly sexually dimorphic. Then, using pictures of young male faces whose attractiveness was assessed on a 7-point scale by young women, the authors showed that attractiveness rate was negatively correlated with EME angle and with the angle asymmetry. The results are compared with those that could be obtained with interpupilary or upper face height measurements.

9468348,Is schizophrenia the price that Homo sapiens pays for language?,['Crow TJ'],Schizophrenia research,1997,"The dichotomy between schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness is, as E. Kraepelin suspected, flawed; no unequivocal separation can be achieved. There are no categories of psychosis, but only continua of variation. However, the definition of nuclear symptoms by K. Schneider reveals the fundamental characteristics of the core syndrome--it is independent of the environment and constant in incidence across populations that have been separated for thousands of years. The associated genetic variation must be as old as Homo sapiens and represent a component of diversity that crosses the population as a whole. The fecundity disadvantage that accompanies the syndrome requires a balance in a substantial and universal advantage; this advantage, it is proposed, is the speciation characteristic of language; language and psychosis have a common evolutionary origin. Language, it is suggested, originated in a critical change on the sex chromosomes (the 'speciation event'--the genetic change that defined the species) occurring in East Africa between 100 and 250 thousand years ago that allowed the two hemispheres to develop with a degree of independence. Language can be understood as bi-hemispheric with one component function--a linear output sequence--confined to the dominant hemisphere--and a second--parallel distributed sampling occurring mainly in the non-dominant hemisphere. This mechanism provides an account of the generativity of language. The significance of nuclear symptoms is that these reflect a breakdown of bi-hemispheric coordination of language, perhaps specifically of the process of 'indexicalisation' (the distinction between 'I' and 'you') of self- versus other-generated references. Nuclear symptoms can be described as 'language at the end of its tether'; the phenomena and population characteristics of the nuclear syndrome of schizophrenia thus yield clues to the origin of the species.",3.923,390

METHODS: The structure, function, drug target and vaccine target of CPR from Plasmodium falciparum were analyzed and predicted by bioinformatics methods. RESULTS: PfCPR, which was older CPR, had close relationship with the CPR from other Plasmodium species, but it was distant from its hosts, such as Homo sapiens and Anopheles. PfCPR was located in the cellular nucleus of Plasmodium falciparum. 335aa-352aa and 591aa - 608aa were inserted the interior side of the nuclear membrane, while 151aa-265aa was located in the nucleolus organizer regions. PfCPR had 40 function sites and 44 protein-protein binding sites in amino acid sequence. The teriary structure of 1aa-700aa was forcep-shaped with wings. 15 segments of PfCPR had no homology with Homo sapien CPR and most were exposed on the surface of the protein. These segments had 25 protein-protein binding sites. While 13 other segments all possessed function sites. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution or genesis of Plasmodium falciparum is earlier than those of Homo sapiens. PfCPR is a possible resistance site of antimalarial drug and may involve immune evasion, which is associated with parasite of sporozoite in hepatocytes. PfCPR is unsuitable as vaccine target, but it has at least 13 ideal drug targets.",1.062,1294

One group of lncRNAs, which are antisense in orientation to coding mRNAs (ASs), have been recently described in cancers but are poorly understood. We sought to identify ASs involved in human gastric cancer (GC) and to elucidate their mechanisms of action in carcinogenesis. We performed massively parallel RNA sequencing in GCs and matched normal tissues, as well as in GC-derived and normal gastric epithelial cell lines. One AS, designated Homo sapiens keratin 7 (KRT7-AS), was selected due to its marked upregulation and concordant expression with its cognate sense counterpart, KRT7, in GC tissues and cell lines. KRT7-AS formed an RNA-RNA hybrid with KRT7 and controlled KRT7 expression at both the mRNA and the post-transcriptional levels. Moreover, forced overexpression of the KRT7-overlapping region (OL) of KRT7-AS (but not its non-KRT7-OL portions) increased keratin 7 protein levels in cells. Finally, forced overexpression of full-length KRT7-AS or OL KRT7-AS (but not its non-KRT7-OL regions) promoted GC cell proliferation and migration. We conclude that lncRNA KRT7-AS promotes GC, at least in part, by increasing KRT7 expression.Oncogene advance online publication, 15 February 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.25.",8.459,725

The two supraorbital structures were examined by visual assessment, and eight quantitative variables were included in the three-way ANOVA, canonical variates analysis and partial rank correlation. The influences of sex and the region of origin of the cranial samples on the relationships between the examined variables and the degrees of supraorbital structures expression were also considered. The results only partially supported the craniofacial size and spatial models and suggested that GL and ST experienced separate influences during development. In the sample of all crania, the neurocranial size more strongly influenced the morphological variation of the ST than of the GL, and sex influenced both of these structures the most. The results suggest that sex may be the main factor (having an influence independent of the other traits) on the morphological variation of the GL and ST.",2.379,66

For M. tuberculosis to transmit from person to person, it has to cause pulmonary disease. Therefore, M. tuberculosis virulence has likely been a significant determinant of the association between M. tuberculosis and humans. Indeed, the evolutionary success of some M. tuberculosis genotypes seems at least partially attributable to their increased virulence. The latter possibly evolved as a consequence of human demographic expansions. If co-evolution occurred, humans would have counteracted to minimize the deleterious effects of M. tuberculosis virulence. The fact that human resistance to infection has a strong genetic basis is a likely consequence of such a counter-response. The genetic architecture underlying human resistance to M. tuberculosis remains largely elusive. However, interactions between human genetic polymorphisms and M. tuberculosis genotypes have been reported. Such interactions are consistent with local adaptation and allow for a better understanding of protective immunity in TB. Future 'genome-to-genome' studies, in which locally associated human and M. tuberculosis genotypes are interrogated in conjunction, will help identify new protective antigens for the development of better TB vaccines.",10.12,62

This striking transformation from spermatogonium to spermatozoa is made possible by the stage-specific adaption of cytoskeleton and associated molecular motor proteins. KIFC1 is a C-terminal kinesin motor found to boast essential roles in acrosome biogenesis and nuclear reshaping during spermiogenesis in rat. To explore its functions during the same process in Macrobrachium nipponense, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA of a mammalian KIFC1 homologue (termed mn-KIFC1) from the total RNA of the testis. The 2,296 bp mn-KIFC1 cDNA contained a 87 bp 5' untranslated region, a 211 bp 3' untranslated region and a 1,998 bp open reading frame. Protein alignment demonstrated that mn-KIFC1 had 37.7, 58.7, 38.4, 37.2, 38.9 and 37.8% identity with its homologues in Salmo salar, Eriocheir sinensis, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis respectively. The phylogenetic tree revealed that mn-KIFC1 is most related to E. Sinensis KIFC1 among the examined species. Tissue expression analysis showed the presence of mn-KIFC1 in the testis, hepatopancreas, gill, muscle and heart. In situ hybridization showed that the mn-KIFC1 mRNA was localized at the periphery of the nuclear membrane and in the proacrosomal vesicle in early and middle spermatids. In late spermatids and spermatozoa, mn-KIFC1 was expressed in the acrosome and in the spike. In situ hybridization also indicated that KIFC1 works together with lamellar complex (LCx) and acroframosome (AFS) to drive acrosome formation and cellular transformation. LCx and AFS have both been previously proved to have essential roles during spermiogenesis in M. nipponense.

The number of psi residues per RNA varied from one in the mitochondrial RNAs to 57 in the cytoplasmic LSU RNA of D. melanogaster and M. musculus. Despite this, all of the psi residues were found in three domains, II, IV and V. All three are at or have been linked to the peptidyl transferase center according to the literature. Comparison of the sites for psi among the species examined revealed four conserved or semi-conserved segments. One is the region 1911 to 1917, which contains three psi or modified psi in almost all species examined. This site is also juxtaposed to the decoding site of the 30 S subunit in the 70 S ribosome and has been implicated in the fidelity of codon recognition. Three additional sites were at the peptidyl transferase center itself. The juxtaposition of the conserved sites for psi with the two important functions of the ribosome, codon recognition and peptide bond formation, implies an important role for psi in ribosome function. We report some new putative modified nucleosides in LSU RNAs as detected by reverse transcription, correct a segment of the sequence of Z. mays chloroplasts and D. melanogaster LSU RNA, correlate the secondary structural context for all known psi residues in ribosomal RNA, and compare the sites for psi with those known for methylated nucleosides in H. sapiens.",4.333,1819

Viruses have developed diverse strategies for evading or utilizing autophagy for survival. The response of the autophagy pathways to virus invasion is poorly documented. Here, we report on the induction of autophagy initiated by the pathogen receptor HSP90AA1 (heat shock protein 90 kDa alpha [cytosolic], class A member 1) via the AKT-MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin)-dependent pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that intracellular autolysosomes packaged avibirnavirus particles. Autophagy detection showed that early avibirnavirus infection not only increased the amount of light chain 3 (LC3)-II, but also upregulated AKT-MTOR dephosphorylation. HSP90AA1-AKT-MTOR knockdown by RNA interference resulted in inhibition of autophagy during avibirnavirus infection. Virus titer assays further verified that autophagy inhibition, but not induction, enhanced avibirnavirus replication. Subsequently, we found that HSP90AA1 binding to the viral protein VP2 resulted in induction of autophagy and AKT-MTOR pathway inactivation. Collectively, our findings suggest that the cell surface protein HSP90AA1, an avibirnavirus-binding receptor, induces autophagy through the HSP90AA1-AKT-MTOR pathway in early infection. We reveal that upon viral recognition, a direct connection between HSP90AA1 and the AKT-MTOR pathway trigger autophagy, a critical step for controlling infection.",11.753,576

The domino effect illustrates that libraries of purvalanol-A are attuned to fill allosteric binding site of HTLV-1 PR through molecular recognition and shows proper binding of ligand pharmacophoric features in receptor contours. Our screening evaluates seven compounds from purvalanol-A libraries, and these compounds' pharmacophore searches for an appropriate place in the binding site and it places well according to respective receptor contour surfaces.

Shu2 functions in the Shu complex with Shu1 and the Rad51 paralogs Csm2 and Psy3. Shu2 belongs to the SWS1 protein family, which is characterized by its SWIM domain (CXC...Xn...CXH), a zinc-binding motif. In humans, SWS1 interacts with the Rad51 paralog SWSAP1. Using genetic and evolutionary analyses, we examined the role of the Shu complex in mitotic and meiotic processes across eukaryotic lineages. We provide evidence that the SWS1 protein family contains orthologous genes in early-branching eukaryote lineages (e.g., Giardia lamblia), as well as in multicellular eukaryotes including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Using sequence analysis, we expanded the SWIM domain to include an invariant alanine three residues after the terminal CXH motif (CXC...Xn...CXHXXA). We found that the SWIM domain is conserved in all eukaryotic orthologs, and accordingly, in vivo disruption of the invariant residues within the canonical SWIM domain inhibits DNA damage tolerance in yeast and protein-protein interactions in yeast and humans. Furthermore, using evolutionary analyses, we found that yeast and Drosophila Shu2 exhibit strong coevolutionary signatures with meiotic proteins, and in yeast, its disruption leads to decreased meiotic progeny. Together our data indicate that the SWS1 family is an ancient and highly conserved eukaryotic regulator of meiotic and mitotic HR.",5.963,58

In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human (Homo sapiens), intermediate cleavage peptidase55 (ICP55) plays a role in stabilizing mitochondrial proteins by the removal of single amino acids from mitochondrial processing peptidase-processed proteins. We have investigated the role of a metallopeptidase (At1g09300) from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that has sequence similarity to yeast ICP55. We identified this protein in mitochondria by mass spectrometry and have studied its function in a transfer DNA insertion line (icp55). Monitoring of amino-terminal peptides showed that Arabidopsis ICP55 was responsible for the removal of single amino acids, and its action explained the -3 arginine processing motif of a number of mitochondrial proteins. ICP55 also removed single amino acids from mitochondrial proteins known to be cleaved at nonconserved arginine sites, a subset of mitochondrial proteins specific to plants. Faster mitochondrial protein degradation rates not only for ICP55 cleaved protein but also for some non-ICP55 cleaved proteins were observed in Arabidopsis mitochondrial samples isolated from icp55 than from the wild type, indicating that a complicated protease degradation network has been affected. The lower protein stability of isolated mitochondria and the lack of processing of target proteins in icp55 were complemented by transformation with the full-length ICP55. Analysis of in vitro degradation rates and protein turnover rates in vivo of specific proteins indicated that serine hydroxymethyltransferase was affected in icp55. The maturation of serine hydroxymethyltransferase by ICP55 is unusual, as it involves breaking an amino-terminal diserine that is not known as an ICP55 substrate in other organisms and that is typically considered a sequence that stabilizes rather than destabilizes a protein.",6.841,854

Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus. RESULTS: Nucleotide composition and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that MARV shows mutation bias and prefers U- and A-ended codons to code amino acids. Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed codon usage analysis of MARV and extends our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage and evolution of MARV.",3.368,582

The analysis of codon usage may improve our understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of Chlamydia and allow reengineering of target genes to improve their expression for gene therapy. Here, we analyzed the codon usage of C. muridarum, C. trachomatis (here indicating biovar trachoma and LGV), C. pneumoniae, and C. psittaci using the codon usage database and the CUSP (Create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). The results show that the four genomes have similar codon usage patterns, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the third codon position. Compared with Homo sapiens, the four chlamydial species show discordant seven or eight preferred codons. The ENC (effective number of codons used in a gene)-plot reveals that the genetic heterogeneity in Chlamydia is constrained by the G+C content, while translational selection and gene length exert relatively weaker influences. Moreover, mutational pressure appears to be the major determinant of the codon usage variation among the chlamydial genes. In addition, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of E. coli, yeast, adenovirus and Homo sapiens. There are 23 codons showing distinct usage differences between C. trachomatis and E. coli, 24 between C. trachomatis and adenovirus, 21 between C. trachomatis and Homo sapiens, but only six codons between C. trachomatis and yeast. Therefore, the yeast system may be more suitable for the expression of chlamydial genes. Finally, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of six eukaryotes, eight prokaryotes and 23 viruses. There is a strong positive correlation between the differences in coding GC content and the variations in codon bias (r=0.905, P<0.001). We conclude that the variation of codon bias between C. trachomatis and other organisms is much less influenced by phylogenetic lineage and primarily determined by the extent of disparities in GC content.",2.191,1562

We aim to give an evolutionary perspective and the possible evolution of the bony pelvis from Lucy to the modern female with the implications in terms of genital prolapse. METHODS: Thirteen pelvimetric measurements were performed on 178 bony pelves: 1 fossil pelvis from Australopithecus Lucy, 128 female Caucasian modern adult pelves and 49 female Catarrhine pelves (29 gorillas and 20 chimpanzees). RESULTS: Lucy's pelvis shape was the most transversely oval, short and broad, termed platypelloid. Modern female pelves were transversely oval only at the inlet. A protruding ischial spine, fairly small ischial tuberosities and a sacral concavity made Lucy closer to Homo sapiens and less like the great apes. In the last group, pelvic planes were anteroposteriorly oval, except in the gorilla, where the outlet was round or slightly transversely oval. The subpubic angle was narrowest in Lucy, whereas it was greater than 90 degrees  in the great apes. CONCLUSIONS: The female pelvis is involved in both visceral support and parturition and represents a compromise. The narrower pelvis of Australopithecus Lucy provided protection against genital prolapse, but resulted in complex obstetrical mechanics. From an evolutionary perspective, the pelvis of Homo sapiens became modified to make parturition easier, but increased the risk of genital prolapse: the ilia became wide open laterally and the sacrum broadened with a shorter distance between the sacroiliac and coxofemoral joints.",1.961,407

However, its utility for network inference in higher eukaryotes has been limited. An improved algorithm with an in-depth understanding of pathway evolution may overcome this limitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of taxonomic structures on co-inheritance analysis using 2,144 reference species in four query species: Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Homo sapiens. We observed three clusters of reference species based on a principal component analysis of the phylogenetic profiles, which correspond to the three domains of life-Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota-suggesting that pathways inherit primarily within specific domains or lower-ranked taxonomic groups during speciation. Hence, the co-inheritance pattern within a taxonomic group may be eroded by confounding inheritance patterns from irrelevant taxonomic groups. We demonstrated that co-inheritance analysis within domains substantially improved network inference not only in microbe species but also in the higher eukaryotes, including humans. Although we observed two sub-domain clusters of reference species within Eukaryota, co-inheritance analysis within these sub-domain taxonomic groups only marginally improved network inference. Therefore, we conclude that co-inheritance analysis within domains is the optimal approach to network inference with the given reference species. The construction of a series of human gene networks with increasing sample sizes of the reference species for each domain revealed that the size of the high-accuracy networks increased as additional reference species genomes were included, suggesting that within-domain co-inheritance analysis will continue to expand human gene networks as genomes of additional species are sequenced. Taken together, we propose that co-inheritance analysis within the domains of life will greatly potentiate the use of the expected onslaught of sequenced genomes in the study of molecular pathways in higher eukaryotes.",3.234,833
11414771,Comparative context of Plio-Pleistocene hominin brain evolution.,"['Elton S', 'Bishop LC', 'Wood B']",Journal of human evolution,2001,"One of the distinguishing features of Homo sapiens is its absolutely and relatively large brain. This feature is also seen in less extreme form in some fossil Homo species. However, are increases in brain size during the Plio-Pleistocene only seen in Homo, and is brain enlargement among Plio-Pleistocene primates confined to hominins? This study examines evidence for changes in brain size for species and lineage samples of three synchronic East African fossil primate groups, the two hominin genera Homo and Paranthropus, and the cercopithecoid genus Theropithecus. Hominin endocranial capacity data were taken from the literature, but it was necessary to develop an indirect method for estimating the endocranial volume of Theropithecus. Bivariate and multivariate regression equations relating measured endocranial volume to three external cranial dimensions were developed from a large (ca. 340) sample of modern African cercopithecoids. These equations were used to estimate the endocranial volumes of 20 Theropithecus specimens from the African Plio-Pleistocene. Spearman's rho and the Hubert nonparametric test were used to search for evidence of temporal trends in both the hominin and Theropithecus data. Endocranial volume apparently increased over time in both Homo and Paranthropus boisei, but there was no evidence for temporal trends in the endocranial volume of Theropithecus. Thus, hypotheses which suggest a mix of environmental, social, dietary, or other factors as catalysts for increasing brain in Plio-Pleistocene primates must accommodate evidence of brain enlargement in both Homo and Paranthropus, and explain why this phenomenon appears to be restricted to hominins.",3.733,1641

The experimental results from Hb solutions revealed a direct correlation between protein resilience, melting temperature and average body temperature of the different species on the 0.1 ns time scale. Molecular forces appeared to be adapted to permit conformational fluctuations with a root mean square displacement close to 1.2 A at the corresponding average body temperature of the endotherms. Strong forces within crocodile Hb maintain the amplitudes of motion within a narrow limit over the entire temperature range in which the animal lives. In fully hydrated powder samples of human and chicken, Hb mean square displacements and effective force constants on the 1 ns time scale showed no differences over the whole temperature range from 10 to 300 K, in contrast to the solution case. A complementary result of the study, therefore, is that one hydration layer is not sufficient to activate all conformational fluctuations of Hb in the pico- to nanosecond time scale which might be relevant for biological function. Coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations permitted to explore residue-specific effects.

Young wild-born chimpanzees from an African sanctuary and 3- to 4-year-old children observed a human demonstrator use a tool to retrieve a reward from a puzzle-box. The demonstration involved both causally relevant and irrelevant actions, and the box was presented in each of two conditions: opaque and clear. In the opaque condition, causal information about the effect of the tool inside the box was not available, and hence it was impossible to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant parts of the demonstration. However, in the clear condition causal information was available, and subjects could potentially determine which actions were necessary. When chimpanzees were presented with the opaque box, they reproduced both the relevant and irrelevant actions, thus imitating the overall structure of the task. When the box was presented in the clear condition they instead ignored the irrelevant actions in favour of a more efficient, emulative technique. These results suggest that emulation is the favoured strategy of chimpanzees when sufficient causal information is available. However, if such information is not available, chimpanzees are prone to employ a more comprehensive copy of an observed action. In contrast to the chimpanzees, children employed imitation to solve the task in both conditions, at the expense of efficiency. We suggest that the difference in performance of chimpanzees and children may be due to a greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions, perhaps combined with a differential focus on the results, actions and goals of the demonstrator.",2.582,529

To address open questions about the interactions of profilin with barbed ends, we measured the effects of a wide range of concentrations of Homo sapiens profilin 1 on the rate of elongation of individual skeletal muscle actin filaments by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Much higher concentrations of profilin were required to stop elongation by AMP-PNP-actin monomers than ADP-actin monomers. High concentrations of profilin depolymerized barbed ends at a rate much faster than the spontaneous dissociation rates of Mg-ATP-, Mg-AMP-PNP-, Mg-ADP-Pi-, and Mg-ADP-actin subunits. Fitting a thermodynamic model to these data allowed us to determine the affinities of profilin and profilin-actin for barbed ends and the influence of the nucleotide bound to actin on these interactions. Profilin has a much higher affinity for ADP-actin filament barbed ends (Kd = 1 muM) than AMP-PNP-actin filament barbed ends (Kd = 226 muM). ADP-actin monomers associated with profilin bind to ADP-actin filament barbed ends 10% as fast as free ADP-actin monomers, but bound profilin does not affect the rate of association of AMP-PNP-actin monomers with barbed ends. The differences in the affinities of AMP-PNP- and ADP-bound barbed ends for profilin and profilin-actin suggest that conformations of barbed end subunits differ from those of monomers and change upon nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release.

These sequences include nuclear receptors, nuclear-receptor factors and nuclear-receptor-like orphans. Working separately with both the central cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain and the carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain, we performed multialignment analyses that included drawings of paralog trees. Our results show that the cluster is highly multibranched, with considerable differences in the amino acid sequence in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and 17 proximal subbranches which are identifiable and fully coincident when independent trees from both domains are compared. We identified the six recently proposed subfamilies as groups of neighboring clusters in the LBD paralog tree. We found similarities of 80%-100% for the N-terminal transactivation domain among mammalian ortholog receptors, as well as some paralog resemblances within diverse subbranches. Our studies suggest that during the evolutionary process, the three domains were assembled in a modular fashion with a nonshuffled modular fusion of the LBD. We used the EMBL server PredictProtein to make secondary-structure predictions for all 38 LBD subsequences. Amino acid residues in the multialigned homologous domains--taking the beginning of helix H3 of the human retinoic acid receptor-gamma as the initial point of reference--were substituted with H or E, which identify residues predicted to be helical or extended, respectively. The result was a secondary structure multialignment with the surprising feature that the prediction follows a canonical pattern of alignable alpha-helices with some short extended elements in between, despite the fact that a number of subsequences resemble each other by less than 25% in terms of the similarity index. We also identified the presence of a binary patterning in all of the predicted helices that were conserved throughout the 38-sequence sample. Our results fit well with a recently proposed evolutionary model that combines protein secondary structure and amino acid replacement.

The present study has identified changes in both M(1) crown size and cusp proportions within the genus Homo, with M(1) overall crown size reduction apparently occurring in two main stages. The first stage (a reduction of ca. 17%) is associated with the emergence of Homo ergaster and Homo erectus sensu stricto. The second stage (a reduction of ca. 10%) occurs in Homo sapiens, but the reduced modern human M(1) tooth crown size was only attained in Upper Paleolithic times. The absolute sizes of the individual cusps are highly positively correlated with overall crown size and dental reduction produces a reduction in the absolute size of each of the cusps. Most of the individual cusps scale isometrically with crown size, but the paracone shows a negative allometric relationship, indicating that the reduction in paracone size is less than in the other M(1) cusps. Thus, the phylogenetically oldest cusp in the upper molars also seems to be the most stable cusp (at least in the M(1)). The most striking change in M(1) cusp proportions is a change in the relative size of the areas of the paracone and metacone. The combination of a small relative paracone and a large relative metacone generally characterizes specimens attributed to early Homo, and the presence of this character state in Australopithecus and Paranthropus suggests it may represent the primitive condition for the later part of the hominin clade. In contrast, nearly all later Homo taxa, with the exception of Homo antecessor, show the opposite condition (i.e. a relatively large paracone and a relatively small metacone). This change in the relationship between the relative sizes of the paracone and metacone is related to an isometric reduction of the absolute size of the metacone. This metacone reduction occurs in the context of relative stability in the paracone as crown size decreases. Among later Homo taxa, both Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis show a further reduction of the metacone and an enlargement of the hypocone. Fossil and contemporary H. sapiens samples show a trend toward increasing the relative size of the protocone and decreasing the relative size of the hypocone. In Europe, modern human M(1) cusp proportions are essentially reached during the Upper Paleolithic. Although some variation was documented among the fossil taxa, we suggest that the relative size of the M(1) paracone and metacone areas may be useful for differentiating the earliest members of our genus from subsequent Homo species.",2.097,1061

In this paper, we present ProNormz, an integrated approach for human proteins (HPs) tagging and normalization. In Homo sapiens, a greater number of biological processes are regulated by a large human gene family called protein kinases by post translational phosphorylation. Recognition and normalization of human protein kinases (HPKs) is considered to be important for the extraction of the underlying information on its regulatory mechanism from biomedical literature. ProNormz distinguishes HPKs from other HPs besides tagging and normalization. To our knowledge, ProNormz is the first normalization system available to distinguish HPKs from other HPs in addition to gene normalization task. ProNormz incorporates a specialized synonyms dictionary for human proteins and protein kinases, a set of 15 string matching rules and a disambiguation module to achieve the normalization. Experimental results on benchmark BioCreative II training and test datasets show that our integrated approach achieve a fairly good performance and outperforms more sophisticated semantic similarity and disambiguation systems presented in BioCreative II GN task. As a freely available web tool, ProNormz is useful to developers as extensible gene normalization implementation, to researchers as a standard for comparing their innovative techniques, and to biologists for normalization and categorization of HPs and HPKs mentions in biomedical literature.

We selected only one TFBS model per TF, unless there was a clear experimental evidence for two rather distinct TFBS models. We assigned a quality rating to each model.

The UROS protein sequences from various taxa were retrieved from GenBank database and were compared using Clustal-W (multiple sequence alignment) with defaults and a first-pass phylogenetic tree was built using neighbor-joining method as in DELTA BLAST 2.2.27+ version. A total of 163 BLAST hits were found for the uroporphyrinogen III synthase query sequence and these hits showed putative conserved domain, HemD superfamily (as on 14(th) Nov 2012). We then narrowed down the search by manually deleting the proteins which were not UROS sequences and sequences belonging to phyla other than Chordata were deleted.

The eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel Rp-NPs, which represent the only heme-binding lipocalins, are devoted to deliver NO into the blood vessel of the host and to scavenge histamine during blood sucking. Regarding Nbs, crystallographic data suggest the ability of At-Nb and Hs-THAP4 to bind ferric heme; however, no data are available with respect to these functions in the natural host. Here, a bioinformatics investigation based on the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of At-Nb and Hs-THAP4 suggests a conservation of the 10-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel Nb structural module in all life kingdoms of the evolutionary ladder. In particular, amino acid residues involved in the heme recognition and in the structure stabilization of the Nb structural module are highly conserved (identity > 29%; homology > 83%). Moreover, molecular models of putative Nbs from different organisms match very well with each other and known three-dimensional structures of Nbs. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree reconstruction indicates that NPs and Nbs group in distinct clades.

23124308,Archaic human genomics.,['Disotell TR'],American journal of physical anthropology,2012,"For much of the 20th century, the predominant view of human evolutionary history was derived from the fossil record. Homo erectus was seen arising in Africa from an earlier member of the genus and then spreading throughout the Old World and into the Oceania. A regional continuity model of anagenetic change from H. erectus via various intermediate archaic species into the modern humans in each of the regions inhabited by H. erectus was labeled the multiregional model of human evolution (MRE). A contrasting model positing a single origin, in Africa, of anatomically modern H. sapiens with some populations later migrating out of Africa and replacing the local archaic populations throughout the world with complete replacement became known as the recent African origin (RAO) model. Proponents of both models used different interpretations of the fossil record to bolster their views for decades. In the 1980s, molecular genetic techniques began providing evidence from modern human variation that allowed not only the different models of modern human origins to be tested but also the exploration demographic history and the types of selection that different regions of the genome and even specific traits had undergone. The majority of researchers interpreted these data as strongly supporting the RAO model, especially analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Extrapolating backward from modern patterns of variation and using various calibration points and substitution rates, a consensus arose that saw modern humans evolving from an African population around 200,000 years ago. Much later, around 50,000 years ago, a subset of this population migrated out of Africa replacing Neanderthals in Europe and western Asia as well as archaics in eastern Asia and Oceania. mtDNA sequences from more than two-dozen Neanderthals and early modern humans re-enforced this consensus. In 2010, however, the complete draft genomes of Neanderthals and of heretofore unknown hominins from Siberia, called Denisovans, demonstrated gene flow between these archaic human species and modern Eurasians but not sub-Saharan Africans. Although the levels of gene flow may be very limited, this unexpected finding does not fit well with either the RAO model or MRE model. More thorough sampling of modern human diversity, additional fossil discoveries, and the sequencing of additional hominin fossils are necessary to throw light onto our origins and our history.",2.379,1780

This conservatism in evolution has resulted in an astonishingly high sequence identity of genes, even between evolutionarily distant species such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens. The recycling of successful concepts in conjunction with gene duplication events has also led to the existence of highly homologous proteins within the genome of many species. Often, these homologous proteins show similar, yet distinct functions that, in combination with their individual tissue distribution, define their specific physiological role. One prominent example is the p53 protein family, which consists of p53, p63, and p73. Recent advances in understanding the specific biological functions of these members have shed some light onto the evolution of this crucial protein family, from a germ line-specific quality-control factor to a somatic tumor suppressor. Furthermore, structures of the oligomerization domains of the mammalian paralogs, p53 and p73, and invertebrate orthologs, CEP-1 and DMP53, have delineated evolutionary changes and revealed that the oligomerization domain of p53 lacks additional stabilizing structural elements present in all other p53 family members.

Although what constitutes living members of our own species is straightforward, in the fossil record this is still a matter of much debate. The issue is complicated by questions of species diagnoses and ideas about the mode by which a new species is born, by the arguments surrounding the behavioural and cognitive separateness of the species, by the increasing appreciation of variation in the early African H. sapiens record and by new DNA evidence of hybridization with extinct species. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study synthesizes thinking on the fossils, archaeology and underlying evolutionary models of the last several decades with recent DNA results from both H. sapiens and fossil species. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that, although it may not be possible or even desirable to cleanly partition out a homogenous morphological description of recent H. sapiens in the fossil record, there are key, distinguishing morphological traits in the cranium, dentition and pelvis that can be usefully employed to diagnose the H. sapiens lineage. Increasing advances in retrieving and understanding relevant genetic data provide a complementary and perhaps potentially even more fruitful means of characterizing the differences between H. sapiens and its close relatives.",1.273,32

Proponents of the single-origin model often view this group as a distinct species with little or no contribution to the evolution of modern humans. Adherents to the regional continuity model consider Neanderthals a subspecies or population of Homo sapiens, which contributed significantly to the evolution of early modern Europeans. Paleontologists generally agree that fossil species should be equivalent to extant ones in the amount of their morphological variation. Recognition of fossil species therefore hinges on analogy to living species. A previous study by one of the authors and recent work by other researchers [Schillachi, M. A. & Froelich, J. W. (2001) Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 115, 157-166] have supported specific status for Neanderthals based on analogy to chimpanzees and Sulawesi macaques, respectively. However, these taxa may not be the most appropriate models for Pleistocene humans. Here we test the hypothesis that Neanderthals represent a subspecies of H. sapiens by comparing the degree of their morphological differentiation from modern humans to that found within and between 12 species of extant primates. The model taxa comprised >1,000 specimens, including phylogenetic (modern humans and African apes) and ecological (eight papionin taxa) models for Pleistocene humans. Morphological distances between model taxon pairs were compared to the distances between Neanderthals and modern humans obtained by using a randomization technique.

No disease-causing mutation was found in MYH3. Segregation of microsatellite markers flanking the TNNI2 and TNNT3 genes at 11p15.5 was compatible with linkage. Subsequent sequencing of TNNI2 revealed a novel mutation, c.A493T (p.I165F), located in the C-terminal region, which is critical for proper protein function. This mutation was found to cosegregate with the FSS phenotype in this family, and assessment using SIFT and PolyPhen-2 predicted a damaging effect.

In this study, short chain fatty acid production was improved by combining a variety of novel enzyme and metabolic engineering strategies.

And then, we established the stable transfected cell lines. Next, after CVB3 infection, apoptosis in different groups was determined by flow cytometry; the expressions of Bim, Bax, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were examined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and western blot analysis; the expression of CVB3 mRNA and viral capsid protein VP1 were also analyzed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence, respectively. At the meantime, CVB3 replication was observed by transmission electron microscope. We found that CVB3-induced cytopathic effect and apoptosis in transfected groups were more obvious than that in controls. Unexpectedly, apoptosis rate in Akt1 group was higher than others at the early stage after viral infection and decreased with the viral-infected time increasing, which was opposite to other groups. Compared with controls, the expression of CVB3 mRNA was increased at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h postinfection (p. i.) in all groups. At the meantime, VP1 expression in 4EBP1 group was higher than control during the process of infection, while the expressions in the other groups were change dynamically. Moreover, overexpression of 4EBP1 did not affect the mRNA expressions of Bim, Bax, caspase-9 and caspase-3; while protein expressions of Bim and Bax were decreased, the self-cleavages of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were stimulated. Meanwhile, overexpression of p70S6K blocked the CVB3-induced Bim, Bax and caspase-9 expressions but promoted the self-cleavage of caspase-9. In the Akt1 group, it is noteworthy that the expressions of Bim protein were higher than controls at 3 and 6 h p. i. but lower at 24 h p. i., and the expression of Bax protein were higher at 6 and 24 h p. i., while their mRNA expressions were all decreased. Furthermore, overexpression of Akt1 stimulated the procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 expression but blocked their self-cleavages. Overexpression of Akt2, however, had little effect on Bim, Bax and caspase-3, while prevented caspase-9 from self-cleavage at the late stage of CVB3 infection. As stated above, our results demonstrated that overexpression of 4EBP1, p70S6K, Akt1 or Akt2 could promote the CVB3-induced apoptosis in diverse degree via different mediating ways in viral replication and proapoptotic factors in BcL-2 and caspase families.

Here, we predict the dimerization specificity properties of the 67 B-ZIP proteins in the A.thaliana genome based on three structural properties of the dimeric alpha-helical leucine zipper coiled coil structure: (i) length of the leucine zipper, (ii) placement of asparagine or a charged amino acid in the hydrophobic interface and (iii) presence of interhelical electrostatic interactions. Many A.thaliana B-ZIP leucine zippers are predicted to be eight or more heptads in length, in contrast to the four or five heptads typically found in H.sapiens, a prediction experimentally verified by circular dichroism analysis. Asparagine in the a position of the coiled coil is typically observed in the second heptad in H.sapiens. In A.thaliana, asparagine is abundant in the a position of both the second and fifth heptads. The particular placement of asparagine in the a position helps define 14 families of homodimerizing B-ZIP proteins in A.thaliana, in contrast to the six families found in H.sapiens. The repulsive interhelical electrostatic interactions that are used to specify heterodimerizing B-ZIP proteins in H.sapiens are not present in A.thaliana. Instead, we predict that plant leucine zippers rely on charged amino acids in the a position to drive heterodimerization. It appears that A.thaliana define many families of homodimerizing B-ZIP proteins by having long leucine zippers with asparagine judiciously placed in the a position of different heptads.",9.112,256

The complex shows considerable genetic diversity and strong phylogeographic relationships. One consequence of the considerable impact that members of the B. tabaci complex have on agriculture, is the view that human activity, particularly in relation to agricultural practices, such as use of insecticides, has driven the diversification found within the species complex. This has been particularly so in the case of two members of the complex, Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) and Mediterranean (MED), which have become globally distributed invasive species. An alternative hypothesis is that diversification is due to paleogeographic and paleoclimatological changes. RESULTS: The idea that human activity is driving speciation within the B. tabaci complex has never been tested, but the increased interest in fossil whiteflies and the growth in molecular data have enabled us to apply a relaxed molecular clock and so estimate divergence dates for the major lineages within the B. tabaci species complex. The divergence estimates do not support the view that human activity has been a major driver of diversification. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the major lineages within the complex arose approximately 60-30 mya and the highly invasive MED and MEAM1 split from the rest of the species complex around 12 mya well before the evolution of Homo sapiens and agriculture. Furthermore, the divergence dates coincide with a period of global diversification that occurred broadly across the plant and animal kingdoms and was most likely associated with major climatic and tectonic events.",3.368,1049

At present, the protein interaction between NBD and PNLVP motif is still unknown, but believed to enhance the rate of virus replication in tumor cells. Three mutant models (E229V, H225P and D230C) were built and simulated, and their interactions with PNLVP motif were studied. The PNLVP motif showed the binding energy and intermolecular energy values with the novel E229V mutant at -7.32 and -11.2 kcal/mol. The E229V mutant had the highest number of hydrogen bonds (7). Based on the root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, hydrogen bonds, salt bridge, secondary structure, surface-accessible solvent area, potential energy and distance matrices analyses, it was proved that the E229V had the strongest and most stable interaction with the PNLVP motif among all the four protein-ligand complex structures.

Several pathogenic bacteria similarly express NeuNAc on their cell surfaces, allowing evasion of their host's immune system. Prokaryotic NeuNAc biosynthesis proceeds via condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), a reaction catalysed by the domain-swapped homodimeric enzyme, N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (NeuNAcS). Conversely, the mammalian orthologue, N-acetylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate synthase (NeuNAc 9-PS) utilises the phosphorylated substrate N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc 6-P) in catalysis. Here we report an investigation into the determinants of substrate specificity of human NeuNAc 9-PS, using model-guided mutagenesis to delineate binding interactions with ManNAc 6-P. Modelling predicts the formation of a domain-swapped homodimer as observed for bacterial variants, which was supported by experimental small angle X-ray scattering. A number of conserved residues which may play key roles in the selection of ManNAc 6-P were identified and substituted for alanine to assess their function. Lys290 and Thr80 were identified as a putative phosphate binding pair, with the cationic lysine residue extending into the active site from the adjacent chain of the dimeric enzyme. Substitution of these residues results in a significant loss of activity and reduced affinity for ManNAc 6-P. These residues, along with the electropositive beta2alpha2 loop, are likely to facilitate the PEP dependent binding and stabilisation of ManNAc 6-P. By utilising a phosphorylated sugar-substrate, the mammalian enzyme gains considerable catalytic affinity advantage over its bacterial counterpart.",4.381,675

These results were replicated in a 2nd experiment in which control trials enabled the authors to rule out that children used spurious cues to solve the matching task. In a 3rd experiment featuring conditions in which the density of the stimuli was manipulated, monkeys' accuracy in the processing of the global shape of the stimuli was negatively affected by the separation of the local elements, whereas children's performance was robust across testing conditions.

Transcriptome analyses often have focused on housekeeping or tissue-specific genes or on gene coexpression. However, by analyzing thousands of single-gene expression distributions in multiple tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), human (Homo sapiens), and mouse (Mus musculus), we found that these organisms primarily operate by gene sharing, a phenomenon where, in each organism, most genes exhibit a high expression level in a few key tissues. We designed an analytical pipeline to characterize this phenomenon and then derived Arabidopsis and human gene-sharing networks, in which tissues are connected solely based on the extent of shared preferentially expressed genes. The results show that tissues or cell types from the same organ system tend to group together to form network modules. Tissues that are in consecutive developmental stages or have common physiological functions are connected in these networks, revealing the importance of shared preferentially expressed genes in conferring specialized functions of each tissue type. The networks provide predictive power for each tissue type regarding gene functions of both known and heretofore unknown genes, as shown by the identification of four new genes with functions in guard cell and abscisic acid response. We provide a Web interface that enables, based on the extent of gene sharing, both prediction of tissue-related functions for any Arabidopsis gene of interest and predictions concerning the relatedness of tissues. Common gene-sharing patterns observed in the four model organisms suggest that gene sharing evolved as a fundamental organizing principle of gene expression in diverse multicellular eukaryotes.",0,1331

Recent imaging studies in early AD patients showed that the parietal areas display the most prominent metabolic impairments. So far, neuroimaging studies have not been able to explain why the medial parietal regions possess this hub characteristic in AD. Paleoneurological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that our species, Homo sapiens, has a unique and derived organization of the parietal areas, which are involved in higher cognitive functions. Combining evidence from neuroimaging, paleontology, and comparative anatomy, we suggest that the vulnerability of the parietal lobe to neurodegenerative processes may be associated with the origin of our species. The species-specific parietal morphology in modern humans largely influenced the brain spatial organization, and it involved changes in vascularization and energy management, which may underlie the sensitivity of these areas to metabolic impairment. Metabolic constraints and anatomical evolutionary changes in the medial parietal regions of modern humans may be important in early AD onset. Taking into account the species-specific adaptations of the modern human parietal areas and their association with AD, we hypothesize that AD can be the evolutionary drawback of the specialized structure of our parietal lobes. The cognitive advantage is associated with increased sensitivity to neurodegenerative processes which, being limited to the post-reproductive period, have a minor effect on the overall genetic fitness. The changes of energy requirements associated with form and size variations at the parietal areas may support the hypothesis of AD as a metabolic syndrome.",4.151,1168

By sorting each high-frequency allele by homozygosity, we search for the expected decay of adjacent SNP linkage disequilibrium (LD) at recently selected alleles, eliminating the need for inferring haplotype. We designate this approach the LD decay (LDD) test. By these criteria, 1.6% of Perlegen SNPs were found to exhibit the genetic architecture of selection. These results were confirmed on an independently generated data set of 1.0 million SNP genotypes (International Human Haplotype Map Phase I freeze). Simulation studies indicate that the LDD test, at the megabase scale used, effectively distinguishes selection from other causes of extensive LD, such as inversions, population bottlenecks, and admixture. The approximately 1,800 genes identified by the LDD test were clustered according to Gene Ontology (GO) categories.

Previous histological works have studied the growth of different craniofacial regions and their relationship to functional spaces in humans up to 14 years old. Nevertheless, how the growth dynamics of the facial skeleton and the mandible are related and how this relationship changes through the late ontogeny remain poorly understood. To approach these two questions, we have compared the bone modelling activities of the craniofacial skeleton from a sample of subadult and adult humans. In this study, we have established for the first time the bone modelling pattern of the face and the mandible from adult humans. Our analyses reveal a patchy distribution of the bone modelling fields (overemphasized by the presence of surface islands with no histological information) reflecting the complex growth dynamics associated to the individual morphology. Subadult and adult specimens show important differences in the bone modelling patterns of the anterior region of the facial skeleton and the posterior region of the mandible. These differences indicate developmental changes in the growth directions of the whole craniofacial complex, from a predominantly downward growth in subadults that turns to a forward growth observed in the adult craniofacial skeleton. We hypothesize that these ontogenetic changes would respond to the physiological and physical requirements to enlarge the oral and nasal cavities once maturation of the brain and the closure of the cranial sutures have taken place during craniofacial development.",2.097,857

In humans and other intermediate hosts, toxoplasma develops into chronic infection that cannot be eliminated by host's immune response or by currently used drugs. In most cases, chronic infections are largely asymptomatic unless the host becomes immune compromised. Thus, toxoplasma is a global health problem and the situation has become more precarious due to the advent of HIV infections and poor toleration of drugs used to treat toxoplasma infection, having severe side effects and also resistance have been developed to the current generation of drugs. The emergence of these drug resistant varieties of T. gondii has led to a search for novel drug targets. We have performed a comparative analysis of metabolic pathways of the host Homo sapiens and the pathogen T. gondii. The enzymes in the unique pathways of T. gondii, which do not show similarity to any protein from the host, represent attractive potential drug targets. We have listed out 11 such potential drug targets which are playing some important work in more than one pathway. Out of these, one important target is Glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme; it plays crucial part in oxidation reduction, metabolic process and amino acid metabolic process. As this is also present in the targets of tropical diseases of TDR (Tropical disease related Drug) target database and no PDB and MODBASE 3D structural model is available, homology models for Glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme were generated using MODELLER9v6. The model was further explored for the molecular dynamics simulation study with GROMACS, virtual screening and docking studies with suitable inhibitors against the NCI diversity subset molecules from ZINC database, by using AutoDock-Vina.

Next-generation sequencing technologies have identified a series of miRNA variants (named isomiRs). In this study, paralogous isomiR assemblies (from the miRNA locus) were systematically analyzed based on data acquired from deep sequencing data sets. Evolutionary analysis of paralogous (members in miRNA gene family in a specific species) and orthologues (across different animal species) miRNAs was also performed. The sequence diversity of paralogous isomiRs was found to be similar to the diversity of paralogous and orthologues miRNAs. Additionally, both isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNAs were implicated in 5' and 3' ends (especially 3' ends), nucleotide substitutions, and insertions and deletions. Generally, multiple isomiRs can be produced from a single miRNA locus, but most of them had lower enrichment levels, and only several dominant isomiR sequences were detected. These dominant isomiR groups were always stable, and one of them would be selected as the most abundant miRNA sequence in specific animal species. Some isomiRs might be consistent to miRNA sequences in some species but not the other. Homologous miRNAs were often detected in similar isomiR repertoires, and showed similar expression patterns, while dominant isomiRs showed complex evolutionary patterns from miRNA sequences across the animal kingdom. These results indicate that the phenomenon of multiple isomiRs is not a random event, but rather the result of evolutionary pressures. The existence of multiple isomiRs enables different species to express advantageous sequences in different environments. Thus, dominant sequences emerge in response to functional and evolutionary pressures, allowing an organism to adapt to complex intra- and extra-cellular events.",2.138,884

Researchers have found that in humans, even at large frequency separations, synchronous tones are heard as a single auditory stream, whereas asynchronous tones with the same frequency separations are perceived as 2 distinct sounds. These findings demonstrate how both the timing and frequency separation of sounds are important for auditory scene analysis. It is unclear how animals, such as budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), perceive synchronous and asynchronous sounds. In this study, budgerigars and humans (Homo sapiens) were tested on their perception of synchronous, asynchronous, and partially overlapping pure tones using the same psychophysical procedures. Species differences were found between budgerigars and humans in how partially overlapping sounds were perceived, with budgerigars more likely to segregate overlapping sounds and humans more apt to fuse the 2 sounds together.

However, the detailed correspondence between hard and soft tissue structures in the proximal femoral region of extant great apes is relatively unknown, because dissection protocols typically do not comprise in-depth osteological descriptions. Here, we use computed tomography and virtopsy (virtual dissection) for non-invasive examination of the femoropelvic musculoskeletal anatomy in Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, and Homo sapiens. Specifically, we analyze the topographic relationship between muscle attachment sites and surface structures of the proximal femoral shaft such as the lateral spiral pilaster. Our results show that the origin of the vastus lateralis muscle is anterior to the insertion of gluteus maximus in all examined great ape specimens and humans. In gorillas and orangutans, the insertion of gluteus maximus is on the inferior (anterolateral) side of the lateral spiral pilaster. In chimpanzees, however, the maximus insertion is on its superior (posteromedial) side, similar to the situation in modern humans. These findings support the hypothesis that chimpanzees and humans exhibit a shared-derived musculoskeletal topography of the proximal femoral region, irrespective of their different locomotor modes, whereas gorillas and orangutans represent the primitive condition. Caution is thus warranted when inferring locomotor behavior from the surface topography of the proximal femur of fossil hominins, as the morphology of this region may contain a strong phyletic signal that tends to blur locomotor adaptation.",1.542,1379

Allometric trends were assessed by examining the correlation between relative cusp areas and MCBA and by calculating the slope of the regression line of log cusp area and log MCBA. With the exception of the metaconid in the Homo sapiens M-2S, the results of the intraspecific analyses provide little evidence of an allometric trend for relative reduction of the mesial cusps with increasing crown size. None of the samples provide consistent or reliable evidence of such a trend for the protoconid, nor do the M-1 samples provide evidence for such a trend for the metaconid.

In this paper, we report on a new reconstruction of this specimen and provide a detailed description and comparison of its morphology. Our reconstruction differs in important respects from the earlier one, especially in terms of neurocranial length, breadth, and height. However, given that Stw 53 exhibits extensive damage, these dimensions are most likely prone to much error in reconstruction. In areas of well-preserved bone, Stw 53 shares many cranial features with Homo habilis, and we propose retaining it within this species. We also consider the affinities of dental remains from Sterkfontein Member 5, along with those from Swartkrans and Drimolen previously assigned to Homo. We find evidence for sympatry of H. habilis and Australopithecus robustus and possibly Plio-Pleistocene Homo sapiens sensu lato in Sterkfontein Member 5. At Swartkrans and Drimolen, we find evidence of H. habilis. We also compare the morphologies of Stw 53 and SK 847 and find compelling evidence to assign the latter specimen to H. habilis, as has been proposed.",3.733,1277

The former has been identified in all three kingdoms of life and often pairs with tRNAGly that carries an A73 discriminator base, while the latter is found only in bacteria and chloroplasts and is almost always coupled with tRNAGly that contains U73. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single GlyRS gene, GRS1, provides both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions, and tRNAGly isoacceptors in both compartments possess A73. We showed herein that Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana cytoplasmic GlyRSs (both alpha2-type enzymes) can rescue both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial defects of a yeast grs1- strain, while Escherichia coli GlyRS (a alpha2beta2-type enzyme) and A. thaliana organellar GlyRS (a (alphabeta)2-type enzyme) failed to rescue either defect of the yeast mull allele. However, a head-to-tail alphabeta fusion of E. coli GlyRS effectively supported the mitochondrial function. Our study suggests that a alpha2-type eukaryotic GlyRS may be functionally substituted with a alpha2beta2-type bacterial cognate enzyme despite their remote evolutionary relationships.",3.234,1014

This mechanism consists of the coordinated activity of two cellular groups: osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone deposition and resorption, respectively. Information obtained from the study of these remodeling growth fields allows us to understand how species-specific craniofacial form is achieved. These data can help to explain the facial growth differences among Primates, both extinct and extant. The aim of this study was to obtain the distribution of growth remodeling fields of the Homo heidelbergensis mandible (Atapuerca-SH sample), and to infer the growth processes responsible for its specific morphology. A Reflected Light Microscope (RLM) was used to identify the microfeatures of the bone surface related to bone deposition and resorption. Results show that H. heidelbergensis presents a specific growth field distribution, which differs slightly between immature and adult individuals. Interpretation of these maps indicates that the mandible of H. heidelbergensis presents noteworthy variability in the symphyseal region. Two distinct patterns of growth are seen, one of those unique for this species and the other similar to that of Homo sapiens. The lingual side of the mandibular corpus has a resorption area found only in this species and one that includes a variable extension in immature and adult individuals. Finally, the mandibular ramus is characterized, among other aspects, by a large resorption field on its buccal surface. Considering the mandible as a whole, the bone remodeling pattern obtained in this work shows that lower facial growth in H. heidelbergensis is dominated mainly by forward growth, illustrated by the strong inward displacement of the ramus, which is in agreement with the Enlow's",3.733,1202

Here, the activity of one of the very few prokaryotic Dnmt2 homologs from Geobacter species (GsDnmt2) was investigated. GsDnmt2 was observed to methylate tRNA-Asp from flies and mice. Unexpectedly, it had only a weak activity toward its matching Geobacter tRNA-Asp, but methylated Geobacter tRNA-Glu with good activity. In agreement with this result, we show that tRNA-Glu is methylated in Geobacter while the methylation is absent in tRNA-Asp. The activities of Dnmt2 enzymes from Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Dictyostelium discoideum for methylation of the Geobacter tRNA-Asp and tRNA-Glu were determined showing that all these Dnmt2s preferentially methylate tRNA-Asp. Hence, the GsDnmt2 enzyme has a swapped transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) specificity. By comparing the different tRNAs, a characteristic sequence pattern was identified in the variable loop of all preferred tRNA substrates. An exchange of two nucleotides in the variable loop of murine tRNA-Asp converted it to the corresponding variable loop of tRNA-Glu and led to a strong reduction of GsDnmt2 activity. Interestingly, the same loss of activity was observed with human DNMT2, indicating that the variable loop functions as a specificity determinant in tRNA recognition of Dnmt2 enzymes.",9.112,945

Using these criteria, we selected heat shock protein 83.1 of Leishmania braziliensis for this study. We predicted three linear B-cell epitopes in its sequence. These peptides and the recombinant heat shock protein 83.1 (rHSP83.1) were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against serum samples from patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum (canine VL [CVL]). Our data show that rHSP83.1 is a promising target in the diagnosis of TL. We also identified specific epitopes derived from HSP83.1 that can be used in the diagnosis of human TL (peptide 3), both human and canine VL (peptides 1 and 3), and all TL, VL, and CVL clinical manifestations (peptide 3). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the superior performance of rHSP83.1 and peptides 1 and 3 compared to that of the soluble L. braziliensis antigen and the reference test kit for the diagnosis of CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC kit; Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz).

Despite the extensive efforts, PPI prediction still has much room to improve. Sequence-based co-evolution methods include the substitution rate method and the mirror tree method, which compare sequence substitution rates and topological similarity of phylogenetic trees, respectively. Although they have been used to predict PPI in species with small genomes like Escherichia coli, such methods have not been tested in large scale proteome like Homo sapiens. RESULT: In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based co-evolution method, co-evolutionary divergence (CD), for human PPI prediction. Built on the basic assumption that protein pairs with similar substitution rates are likely to interact with each other, the CD method converts the evolutionary information from 14 species of vertebrates into likelihood ratios and combined them together to infer PPI. We showed that the CD method outperformed the mirror tree method in three independent human PPI datasets by a large margin. With the arrival of more species genome information generated by next generation sequencing, the performance of the CD method can be further improved.

Collectively, both vertebrate and invertebrate DBHS proteins function throughout gene regulation, largely but not always, within the nucleus. In this study, we report a structural and bioinformatic analysis of the DBHS protein family to guide future studies into DBHS protein function. To explore the structural plasticity of the family, we describe the 2.4 A crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein 1 (NONO-1). The structure is dimeric, with a domain arrangement consistent with mammalian DBHS proteins. Comparison with the DBHS structures available from H. sapiens reveals that there is inherent domain flexibility within the homologous DBHS region. Mapping amino acid similarity within the family to the NONO-1 dimer highlights the dimer interface, coiled-coil oligomerization motif, and putative RNA binding surfaces. Surprisingly, the interior surface of RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) that faces a large internal void is highly variable, but the external beta2-beta3 loops of RRM2 show remarkable preservation. Overall, the DBHS region is under strong purifying selection, whereas the sequences N- and C-terminal to the DBHS region are less constrained.

This perspective was extended for the 1st time to the category learning of nonhuman primates. Humans (Homo sapiens) and macaques (Macaca mulatta) learned categories composed of sine-wave gratings that varied across trials in bar width and bar orientation. The categories had either a single-dimensional, rule-based solution or a two-dimensional, information-integration solution. Humans strongly dimensionalized the stimuli and learned the rule-based task far more quickly. Six macaques showed the same performance advantage in the rule-based task. In humans, rule-based category learning is linked to explicit cognition, consciousness, and declarative reports about the contents of cognition. These results demonstrate an empirical continuity between human and nonhuman primate cognition, suggesting that nonhuman primates may have some structural components of humans' capacity for explicit cognition.",1.087,237

Attempts to predict natural peptides are limited by the low performance of proteolytic site predictors and by the high combinatorial complexity of pairing such sites. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the site-wise evolutionary mutation rates of peptide hormone precursors, calculated using the Rate4Site algorithm. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that within their precursors, peptide residues are significantly more conserved than the pro-peptide residues. This disparity enables the prediction of peptides with a precision of  approximately 60% at a recall of 40% [receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) AUC 0.79]. Subsequently, combining the Rate4Site score with additional features and training a Random Forest classifier enable the prediction of natural peptides hidden within secreted human proteins at a precision of  approximately 90% at a recall of 50% (ROC AUC 0.96). The high performance of our method allows it to be applied to full secretomes and to predict naturally occurring active peptides. Our prediction on Homo sapiens revealed several putative peptides in the human secretome that are currently unannotated. Furthermore, the unique expression of some of these peptides implies a potential hormone function, including peptides that are highly expressed in endocrine glands.

A role for the CAPN10 gene in diabetes mellitus type II was recently identified. Hyper activation of the enzyme initiates a series of destructive cycles that can cause irreversible damage to cells. The development of inhibitors may be useful as therapeutic agents for a number of calpainopathies. In this paper, we have used the homology modelling technique to determine the 3D structure of calpain-10 from Homo sapiens. The model of calpain-10 obtained by homology modelling suggests that its active site is conserved among family members and the main interactions are similar to those observed for mu-calpain. Structural analysis revealed that there are small differences in the charge distribution and molecular surface of the enzyme. These differences are probably less dependent on calcium for calpain-10 than they are for mu-calpain. In addition, the ion pair Cys(-)/His(+) formation was observed using of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations that were based upon hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approaches.

Here, we isolated a full-length cDNA sequence inferred to encode a novel cystatin gene from a blood fluke, Schistosoma japonicum. The cDNA, designated SjCystatin, comprised an open reading frame (ORF) of 306 bp, and encoded 101 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 11.3 kDa. This predicted protein shared a significant degree of sequence identity with the type I cystatin (stefin) of Schistosoma mansoni and Homo sapiens. These proteins exhibited a typical cystatin topology, including the absence of disulfide bonds and three conserved catalytic motifs, Gly at the N-terminus (Gly(6)), Gln-X-Val-X-Gly motif (Q(49)VVAG(53)) and an LP pair at the C-terminus (L(76)P(77)). The SjCystatin gene spanned 376 bp and contained three exons. The positions of two introns were conserved between the cystatin genes of trematodes and their vertebrate hosts. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the transcription of SjCystatin in the egg, schistosomula and adult stages of S. japonicum. The encoding ORF region was cloned into pET-28a (+) prokaryotic expression vector. After purification, the recombinant protein SjCystatin (recSjCystatin), expressed in Escherichia coli, was used to immunize animals and produce its specific polyclonal antibody. Western blot analysis revealed that the native SjCystatin was expressed in the egg and adult stages. The enzyme activity assay of the recSjCystatin showed that it inhibited the proteolytic activity of papain. SjCystatin protein was mainly localized on the miracidium within eggs. Immunohistochemistry revealed that SjCystatin mainly localized in the epithelial cells lining the gut as well as the tegument on the surface of adult worms. The conserved genomic DNA structure among cystatin homologues of trematode and their vertebrate host emphasized the characteristics of compatibility between parasites and their hosts.

However, the mechanisms regarding these actions remain unclear. mRNA differential display was used in this study to identify genetic differences. A novel D. discoideum gene (GenBank accession number: KC759140) encoding a new zinc protease was cloned. The amino acid sequence of the novel gene exhibited a conserved zinc-binding domain (HEX2HX18E) that allowed its classification into the M1 family of metallopeptidases. The gene encoded a 345-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 39.69 kDa and a theoretical pI of 6.05. This protein showed strong homology with leukotriene A4 (LTA4) hydrolase of Homo sapiens (41% identity and 60% similarity at the amino acid level). By analyzing quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data, this zinc protease gene was more highly expressed in D. discoideum allC RNAi mutant type than in wild-type KAx-3 cells during the trophophase.

Two major routes of dispersal have been hypothesized: one through North Africa into the Levant, documented by fossil remains, and one through Ethiopia along South Asia, for which little, if any, evidence exists. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be used to trace maternal ancestry. The geographic distribution and variation of mtDNAs can be highly informative in defining potential range expansions and migration routes in the distant past. The mitochondrial haplogroup M, first regarded as an ancient marker of East-Asian origin, has been found at high frequency in India and Ethiopia, raising the question of its origin. (A haplogroup is a group of haplotypes that share some sequence variations.) Its variation and geographical distribution suggest that Asian haplogroup M separated from eastern-African haplogroup M more than 50,000 years ago. Two other variants (489C and 10873C) also support a single origin of haplogroup M in Africa. These findings, together with the virtual absence of haplogroup M in the Levant and its high frequency in the South-Arabian peninsula, render M the first genetic indicator for the hypothesized exit route from Africa through eastern Africa/western India.

Genetic data have been increasingly used to address these questions. Genetic data on living human populations have been used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the human species by considering how global patterns of human variation could be produced given different evolutionary scenarios. Of particular interest are gene trees that reconstruct the time and place of the most recent common ancestor of humanity for a given haplotype and the analysis of regional differences in genetic diversity. Ancient DNA has also allowed a direct assessment of genetic variation in European Neandertals. Together with the fossil record, genetic data provide insight into the origin of modern humans. The evidence points to an African origin of modern humans dating back to 200,000 years followed by later expansions of moderns out of Africa across the Old World. What is less clear is what happened when these early modern humans met preexisting 'archaic human' populations outside of Africa.

We were able to identify a near full-length expressed DQB sequence by RACE-PCR method from the Asiatic black bear, Ursus thibetanus in Japan. This is the first such full length expression in the Ursidae. The bear had at least one functional DQB locus. In phylogenetic tree analysis its DQB amino acid sequence formed a monophyletic group with DQB sequences from members of the order Carnivora and had a 90% nucleotide sequence similarity with the DQB allele of the California sea lion, Zalophus californianus. We compared the DQB amino acid composition of U. thibetanus with those of several other mammalian species including Homo sapiens. Amino acid residues known to be functionally important for human MHC genes, tended to be also conserved among other mammalian species while PBRs in the beta1 domain were heterogeneous among mammalian species. The DQB sequence obtained from the bear had not only no putative frameshifts or deletions but also no abnormal amino acid mutations such as had been observed in human DQB molecules. This suggests that the bear DQB sequence was an apparently functional DQB allele. As a preliminary study, we sequenced the exon 2 region of DQB alleles from genomic DNA, and succeeded to amplify the exon 2 of DQB loci.

The kuruma shrimp TNF (MjTNF) cDNA was composed of 1868 bp with a 262 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and a 220 bp 3'-UTR, which was translated into a protein of 462 amino acid residues that included a predicted transmembrane domain of 23 amino acid residues (Trp20-Val42) and the TNF family signature (Pro321-Leu448). Homology analysis of MjTNF showed 30.7% and 26.7% identities with fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) Eiger and human (Homo sapiens) ectodysplasin A, respectively. The MjTNF gene was constitutively expressed in unstimulated organs of shrimp such as the muscle, stomach, brain and gill. In lymphoid organ cells, an enhanced expression of the MjTNF gene was observed following stimulation with peptidoglycan and polycytidylic acid. A high expression level of MjTNF was observed in vivo 2 h and 4 h after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and Vibrio penaeicida, respectively. These observations suggest that MjTNF plays a role in the innate immune defense in kuruma shrimp. The discovery of shrimp TNF will allow a more complete and concrete understanding of shrimp inflammatory responses.",2.674,1778
25037487,Computational reconstruction of proteome-wide protein interaction networks between HTLV retroviruses and Homo sapiens.,"['Mei S', 'Zhu H']",BMC bioinformatics,2014,"BACKGROUND: Human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) tend to induce some fatal human diseases like Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) by targeting human T lymphocytes. To indentify the protein-protein interactions (PPI) between HTLV viruses and Homo sapiens is one of the significant approaches to reveal the underlying mechanism of HTLV infection and host defence. At present, as biological experiments are labor-intensive and expensive, the identified part of the HTLV-human PPI networks is rather small. Although recent years have witnessed much progress in computational modeling for reconstructing pathogen-host PPI networks, data scarcity and data unavailability are two major challenges to be effectively addressed. To our knowledge, no computational method for proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI networks reconstruction has been reported. RESULTS: In this work we develop Multi-instance Adaboost method to conduct homolog knowledge transfer for computationally reconstructing proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI networks. In this method, the homolog knowledge in the form of gene ontology (GO) is treated as auxiliary homolog instance to address the problems of data scarcity and data unavailability, while the potential negative knowledge transfer is automatically attenuated by AdaBoost instance reweighting. The cross validation experiments show that the homolog knowledge transfer in the form of independent homolog instances can effectively enrich the feature information and substitute for the missing GO information. Moreover, the independent tests show that the method can validate 70.3% of the recently curated interactions, significantly exceeding the 2.1% recognition rate by the HT-Y2H experiment. We have used the method to reconstruct the proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI networks and further conducted gene ontology based clustering of the predicted networks for further biomedical research. The gene ontology based clustering analysis of the predictions provides much biological insight into the pathogenesis of HTLV retroviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The Multi-instance AdaBoost method can effectively address the problems of data scarcity and data unavailability for the proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI interaction networks reconstruction. The gene ontology based clustering analysis of the predictions reveals some important signaling pathways and biological modules that HTLV retroviruses are likely to target.",2.576,67

Several previous reports suggest the existence of sequencing bias of NGS reads. To address this question in greater detail, we analyze NGS data from four organisms with different GC content, Plasmodium falciparum (19.39%), Arabidopsis thaliana (36.03%), Homo sapiens (40.91%) and Streptomyces coelicolor (72.00%). Using machine learning techniques, we recognize the pattern that the NGS read start is positioned in the local region where the nucleotide distribution is dissimilar from the global nucleotide distribution. We also demonstrate that the mono-nucleotide distribution underestimates sequencing bias, and the recognized pattern is explained largely by the distribution of multi-nucleotides (di-, tri-, and tetra- nucleotides) rather than mono-nucleotides. This implies that the correction of sequencing bias needs to be performed on the basis of the multi-nucleotide distribution. Providing companion software to quantify the effect of the recognized pattern on read positioning, we exemplify that the bias correction based on the mono-nucleotide distribution may not be sufficient to clean sequencing bias.",3.234,742

Firstly, 50 fresh tissues and 143 paraffin-embedded meningiomas samples were analyzed for LASS2 expression by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Subsequently, LASS2 immunostaining was evaluated for its clinical significance. Furthermore, Correlations of LASS2 expression with common biomarkers were assessed. Both PCR and IHC results showed LASS2 was downregulated in high-grade meningiomas in comparison with that of grade I or normal brain (all P < 0.01). IHC results demonstrated LASS2 intensity distribution (ID) score was significantly correlated with tumor size, brain invasion, tumor recurrence and clinical course (all P < 0.01), whereas no correlation of LASS2 ID score with sex or Simpson grade. Moreover, lower LASS2 ID score was strikingly associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival (P < 0.01). Pearson's analysis revealed the ID score was significantly reversely associated with Ki-67 and p53 but not with PR. More importantly,multivariate analyses revealed that LASS2 was an independent prognostic factor (P < 0.05). To our knowledge, it is the first time to investigate the expression of LASS2 and identify it as a potential biomarker for prognosis in meningiomas.",3.07,944

We have used this to determine the occupancy of the binding site during transhydrogenation reactions catalysed by mixtures of recombinant dI from the R. rubrum enzyme and either hsdIII or rrdIII.D155W. The standard redox potential of NADP(+)/NADPH bound to the dIII proteins is some 60-70 mV higher than that in free solution. This results in favoured reduction of NADP(+) by NADH at the catalytic site, and supports the view that changes in affinity at the nucleotide-binding site of dIII are central to the mechanism by which transhydrogenase is coupled to proton translocation across the membrane.",4.381,535

The traditional view is that there is an encapsulated reorientation module that can only process environmental geometry such as distances or angles (Cheng, 1986). Recently, this view has been challenged on the grounds that the reorientation mechanism is only able to accept geometric information and may instead depend on a more general ability to use relative cues. J. Huttenlocher and S. F. Lourenco (2007) demonstrated that toddlers are successfully able to reorient with continuous cues but show remarkable deficits using categorical cues that are similar in perceptual complexity for reorientation. Here, the authors show the same pattern of results with mice (Mus musculus). These findings provide evidence that there is a homologous reorientation mechanism between mice and humans.

In contrast, the paucity of hominin fossil evidence from East Asia from this period impedes a complete evolutionary picture of the genus Homo, as well as assessment of the possible contribution of or interaction with Asian hominins in the evolution of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. Here we present a comparative study of a hominin dental sample recovered from the Xujiayao site, in Northern China, attributed to the early Late Pleistocene (MIS 5 to 4). Our dental study reveals a mosaic of primitive and derived dental features for the Xujiayao hominins that can be summarized as follows: i) they are different from archaic and recent modern humans, ii) they present some features that are common but not exclusive to the Neanderthal lineage, and iii) they retain some primitive conformations classically found in East Asian Early and Middle Pleistocene hominins despite their young geological age. Thus, our study evinces the existence in China of a population of unclear taxonomic status with regard to other contemporary populations such as H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis. The morphological and metric studies of the Xujiayao teeth expand the variability known for early Late Pleistocene hominin fossils and suggest the possibility that a primitive hominin lineage may have survived late into the Late Pleistocene in China.",2.379,554

Genetic differences among populations interact with environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle, leading to differences in nutrient metabolism, which translate into differences in susceptibility to a variety of diseases. Individuals from different populations sharing the same environments can exhibit differences in disease risk, as do individuals from the same population living in various regions of the globe. Therefore, it is important to understand how adaptive genetic variations interact with environments to influence health. This knowledge will provide a broad foundation for designing experiments and approaches in nutrigenomics research and strengthening the knowledge base for dietary recommendations for disease prevention. The objectives of this chapter are to (1) understand the methodology employed in examining adaptive genetic variation across populations, (2) establish the importance of adaptive genetic variation to human health, and (3) discuss the implications for nutrigenomics research and disease prevention.",3.488,1380

Alternatively, recent studies suggest that different types of experience modulate some perceptual foundations for musical sounds. The present study tested whether the mechanisms involved in the perception of consonance are present in an animal with no extensive experience with harmonic stimuli and a relatively limited vocal repertoire. In Experiment 1, rats were trained to discriminate consonant from dissonant chords and tested to explore whether they could generalize such discrimination to novel chords. In Experiment 2, we tested if rats could discriminate between chords differing only in their interval ratios and generalize them to different octaves. To contrast the observed pattern of results, human adults were tested with the same stimuli in Experiment 3. Rats successfully discriminated across chords in both experiments, but they did not generalize to novel items in either Experiment 1 or Experiment 2. On the contrary, humans not only discriminated among both consonance-dissonance categories, and among sets of interval ratios, they also generalized their responses to novel items. These results suggest that experience with harmonic sounds may be required for the construction of categories among stimuli varying in frequency ratios. However, the discriminative capacity observed in rats suggests that at least some components of auditory processing needed to distinguish chords based on their interval ratios are shared across species.",1.52,60

We hypothesized that differences in codon bias, either between-species differences in orthologous genes, or within-species differences between genes, may play an evolutionary role. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the genome-wide codon bias in six species that occupy vital positions in the Eukaryotic Tree of Life. We acquired the entire protein coding sequences for these organisms, computed the codon bias for all genes in each organism and explored the output for relationships between codon bias and protein function, both within- and between-lineages. We discovered five notable coordinated patterns, with extreme codon bias most pronounced in traits considered highly characteristic of a given lineage. Firstly, the Homo sapiens genome had stronger codon bias for DNA-binding transcription factors than the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, whereas the opposite was true for ribosomal proteins--perhaps underscoring transcriptional regulation in the origin of complexity. Secondly, both mammalian species examined possessed extreme codon bias in genes relating to hair--a tissue unique to mammals. Thirdly, Arabidopsis thaliana showed extreme codon bias in genes implicated in cell wall formation and chloroplast function--which are unique to plants. Fourthly, Gallus gallus possessed strong codon bias in a subset of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins--perhaps reflecting the enhanced bioenergetic efficiency in birds that co-evolved with flight. And lastly, the G. gallus genome had extreme codon bias for the Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor--which may help to explain their spontaneous recovery from deafness. We propose that extreme codon bias in groups of genes that encode functionally related proteins has a pathway-level energetic explanation.",3.234,1571

Some studies emphasize only one of these indicators and other studies consider combinations of indicators. To better understand the biocultural nature of human size and proportions a new study of the growth of Maya-American youngsters was undertaken in 1999 and 2000. One purpose of this research is to assess changes in body proportion between Maya growing up in the US and Maya growing up in Guatemala. Height and sitting height of 6-12-year-old boys and girls (n=360) were measured and the sitting height ratio [sitting height/height]x100, a measure of proportion, was calculated. These data are compared with a sample of Maya of the same ages living in Guatemala and measured in 1998 (n=1297). Maya-American children are currently 10.24 cm taller, on average, and have a significantly lower sitting height ratio, (i.e. relatively longer legs, averaging 7.02 cm longer) than the Guatemala Maya. Maya-American children have body proportions more like those of white children in the US than like Maya children in Guatemala. Improvements in the environment for growth, in terms of nutrition and health, seem to explain both the trends in greater stature and relatively longer legs for the Maya-Americans. These findings are applied to the problem of modern human origins as assessed from fossil skeletons. It has been proposed that heat adapted, relatively long-legged Homo sapiens from Africa replaced the cold adapted, relatively short-legged Homo neandertalensis of the Levant and Europe [J Hum Evol 32 (1997a) 423]. Skeletal samples of Maya adults from rural Guatemala have body proportions similar to adult Neandertals and to skeletal samples from Europe with evidence of nutritional and disease stress. Just as nutrition and health status explains the differences in the body proportions of living Maya children, these factors, along with adaptation to climate, may also explain much of the differences between the Neandertal and African hominid samples.",2.055,1875

In the present study, we converted the BAC regulatory region of the Mus musculus Wap gene into a mammary gland-specific expression vector. Using the galK-based positive-negative selection method, we seamlessly replaced the Wap gene in a BAC with Homo sapiens GPX3, MT2, and Luc genes while keeping the original mammary gland-specific regulatory sequence intact, without introducing any extra sequences (Loxp/Frt). To improve the efficiency of creating BAC transgenic mice, we used a Tol2 transposon system optimized for mammalian codons and eliminated 100 kb of sequence from the BAC 5' end (173 kb), which resulted in an 8.5% rate of successful gene transmission via pronuclear injection.

The elements of extracellular domains (ECD) in CfTLR displayed high homology to the corresponding parts of the ECDs in TLRs from Homo sapiens. CfTLR protein was detected in hemocytes, mantle, gills, hepatopancreas, kidney and gonad of the scallops, and it was localized in both the plasma membranes and the lysosomes in HEK293T cells. CfTLR could activate NFkappaB in response to multiple HsTLR ligands including Pam3CSK4, glucan (GLU), peptidoglycan (PGN), polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C), Imiquimod and three types of CpG. Additionally, the scallop serum could enhance the induction of NFkappaB in the CfTLR expressing cells elicited by most PAMPs, including GLU, PGN, Imiquimod and four types of CpG.

To test these assumptions, ulnar articular proportions and the antebrachial index (radius length/ulna length) in Homo sapiens (n=51), Gorilla gorilla (n=88), Pan troglodytes (n=49), Pongo pygmaeus (n=36) and Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1 and A.L. 438-1 are compared.

Open-data global data bases now exist on animal migration, species distribution, conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom world-wide. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository, which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species world-wide, from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices. COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, taxonomy, biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide R code to some of these examples.

We studied the effects of HSJ1a on the protein levels of both normal and the disease--related polyQ-expanded forms of ataxin-3 (Atx3) in cells. The results demonstrate that the N-terminal J-domain and the C-terminal UIM domain of HSJ1a exert opposite functions in regulating the protein level of cellular overexpressed Atx3. This dual regulation is dependent on the binding of the J-domain with HSP70, and the UIM domain with polyUb chains. The J-domain down-regulates the protein level of Atx3 through HSP70 mediated proteasomal degradation, while the UIM domain may alleviate this process via maintaining the ubiquitinated Atx3. We propose that co-chaperone HSJ1a orchestrates the balance of substrates in stressed cells in a Yin-Yang manner.",3.234,1582

In coastal archaeology worldwide, there has been a debate over the general productivity of intertidal foraging, leading to studies that directly measure productivity in some regions, but there have been no such studies in South Africa. Here we present energetic return rate estimates for intertidal foraging along the southern coast of South Africa from Blombos Cave to Pinnacle Point. Foraging experiments were conducted with Khoi-San descendants of the region, and hourly caloric return rates for experienced foragers were measured on 41 days near low tide and through three seasons over two study years. On-site return rates varied as a function of sex, tidal level, marine habitat type and weather conditions. The overall energetic return rate from the entire sample (1492 kcal h(-1)) equals or exceeds intertidal returns reported from other hunter-gatherer studies, as well as measured return rates for activities as diverse as hunting mammals and plant collecting. Returns are projected to be exceptionally high ( approximately  3400 kcal h(-1) for men,  approximately  1900 kcal h(-1) for women) under the best combination of conditions. However, because of the monthly tidal cycle, high return foraging is only possible for about 10 days per month and for only 2-3 h on those days. These experiments suggest that while intertidal resources are attractive, women and children could not have subsisted independently, nor met all their protein-lipid needs from marine resources alone, and would have required substantial additional energy and nutrients from plant gathering and/or from males contributing game.",3.733,708
10423830,Bolkian and Bokian retardation in Homo sapiens.,['Verhulst J'],Acta biotheoretica,1999,"Although a low genetic barrier is said to separate humans from apes, Homo sapiens is characterized by striking developmental and anatomical particularities. On the one hand, humans have a very extended life history (retardation). On the other hand, human anatomy shows many instances of both neoteny and hypermorphosis. In 1918, Bolk proposed his 'retardation theory' that links both aspects of the human condition. We show in this paper that his theory becomes surprisingly powerful when Bolk's retardation principle is applied to generalized developmental gradients (such as the cephalocaudal gradient that dominates overall ontogeny). In this way, the main particularities of the human body (extended life history; long limbs, and very long legs; very low brachial and crural indices; highly developed pollex and hallux; reduced prognathism; advanced telencephalization etc.) can be reduced to a single developmental matrix. In 1926, Bok noted that, in a series of equivalent organs (such as the finger row), the ontogenetic latecomer tends to be more neotenic than a corresponding forerunner. We show that Bok's observation is a logical corollary of Bolk's retardation theory and that it is important for understanding some pecularities of human anatomy such as the pronounced differentiation between hands and feet.",0.704,340

Thus, changes induced by the presence of a ligand can be directly translated to binding affinities for the eukaryotic decoding center. Binding data for the eukaryotic ribosomal decoding center can be easily obtained by this method and are in excellent agreement with previously reported values measured by alternative techniques. Furthermore, a good correlation is obtained between the experimental binding affinities and the biological activity of the compounds examined.

22839428,Newly evolved introns in human retrogenes provide novel insights into their evolutionary roles.,"['Kang LF', 'Zhu ZL', 'Zhao Q', 'Chen LY', 'Zhang Z']",BMC evolutionary biology,2012,"BACKGROUND: Retrogenes generally do not contain introns. However, in some instances, retrogenes may recruit internal exonic sequences as introns, which is known as intronization. A retrogene that undergoes intronization is a good model with which to investigate the origin of introns. Nevertheless, previously, only two cases in vertebrates have been reported. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically screened the human (Homo sapiens) genome for retrogenes that evolved introns and analyzed their patterns in structure, expression and origin. In total, we identified nine intron-containing retrogenes. Alignment of pairs of retrogenes and their parents indicated that, in addition to intronization (five cases), retrogenes also may have gained introns by insertion of external sequences into the genes (one case) or reversal of the orientation of transcription (three cases). Interestingly, many intronizations were promoted not by base substitutions but by cryptic splice sites, which were silent in the parental genes but active in the retrogenes. We also observed that the majority of introns generated by intronization did not involve frameshifts. CONCLUSIONS: Intron gains in retrogenes are not as rare as previously thought. Furthermore, diverse mechanisms may lead to intron creation in retrogenes. The activation of cryptic splice sites in the intronization of retrogenes may be triggered by the change of gene structure after retroposition. A high percentage of non-frameshift introns in retrogenes may be because non-frameshift introns do not dramatically affect host proteins. Introns generated by intronization in human retrogenes are generally young, which is consistent with previous findings for Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results provide novel insights into the evolutionary role of introns.",3.368,1283

In 84 families affected by schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder no tendency toward increased allele sharing amongst siblings was observed (chi(2) = 0.002). We conclude either that this region does not include a gene predisposing to psychosis or that if it does, the relevant variation is epigenetic rather than sequence-based. With respect to the latter possibility we draw attention to the recent evolutionary history of the Xq21.3/Yp region.

This enzyme has a unique arrangement of the fourth and fifth amino acid upstream from the first aspartic rich motif (FARM) where the fourth amino acid is aromatic and the fifth is a cysteine. We mutated these amino acids, converting the enzyme to an absolute FPPS by changing the cysteine to a tyrosine. The enzyme could be converted to an absolute GGPPS by changing both the fourth and fifth amino acids to alanines. We also constructed four mutated TgFPPSs whose regions around the first aspartate rich motif were replaced with the corresponding regions of FPP synthases from Arabidopsis thaliana or Saccharomyces cerevisiae or with the corresponding regions of GGPP synthases from Homo sapiens or S. cerevisiae. We determined that the presence of a cysteine at the fifth position is essential for the TgFPPS bifunctionality. We also found that the length of the N-terminal domain plays a role in determining the specificity and the length of the isoprenoid product. Phylogenetic analysis supports the grouping of this enzyme with other type I FPPSs, but the biochemical data indicate that TgFPPS has unique characteristics that differentiate it from mammalian FPPSs and GGPPSs and is therefore an important drug target.",3.015,1307

They rapidly interrupt feeding of the target pest and eventually kill the pest due to starvation. However, information about the structure and function of insect RyRs is still limited. In this study, we isolated a 15,985bp full-length cDNA (named SfRyR) from Sogatella furcifera, a serious rice planthopper pest throughout Asia. SfRyR encodes a 5140-amino acid protein, which shares 78-97% sequence identities with other insect homologues, and less than 50% identities with Homo sapiens RyR1-3. All hallmarks of the RyR proteins are conserved in SfRyR. In the N-terminus, SfRyR has a MIR domain, two RIH domains, three SPRY domains, four copies of RyR repeated domain and a RIH-associated domain. In the C-terminus, SfRyR possesses two consensus calcium ion-binding EF-hand motifs, and six transmembrane helices. Temporal and spatial expression analysis showed that SfRyR was widely found in all development stages including egg, first through fifth instar nymphs, macropterous adult females and males. On day 2 fifth-instar nymphs, SfRyR was ubiquitously expressed in the head, thorax and abdomen. Dietary ingestion of dsSfRyR1 and dsSfRyR2 significantly reduced the mRNA level of SfRyR in the treated nymphs by 77.9% and 81.8% respectively, and greatly decreased chlorantraniliprole-induced mortality. Thus, our results suggested that SfRyR gene encoded a functional RyR that mediates chlorantraniliprole toxicity to S. furcifera.",2.014,1078

Developmental and comparative perspectives can contribute to identifying the mechanisms that underlie systematic perceptual errors often referred to as perceptual illusions. In the visual domain, some illusions appear to remain constant across the lifespan, whereas others change with age. From a comparative perspective, many of the illusions observed in humans appear to be shared with nonhuman primates. Numerosity illusions are a subset of visual illusions and occur when the spatial arrangement of stimuli within a set influences the perception of quantity. Previous research has found one such illusion that readily occurs in human adults, the Solitaire illusion. This illusion appears to be less robust in two monkey species, rhesus macaques and capuchin monkeys. We attempted to clarify the ontogeny of this illusion from a developmental and comparative perspective by testing human children and task-naive capuchin monkeys in a computerized quantity judgment task. The overall performance of the monkeys suggested that they perceived the numerosity illusion, although there were large differences among individuals. Younger children performed similarly to the monkeys, whereas older children more consistently perceived the illusion. These findings suggest that human-unique perceptual experiences with the world might play an important role in the emergence of the Solitaire illusion in human adults, although other factors also may contribute.",2.549,35

Following from previous work indicating that adult human participants can exhibit cumulative learning on the basis of product copying alone, we now investigate whether such learning involves high fidelity transmission. Eighty adult human (Homo sapiens) participants were presented with a task previously shown to elicit cumulative learning under experimental conditions, which involved building a tower from spaghetti and modeling clay. Each participant was shown two completed towers, ostensibly built by previous participants, but actually built to prespecified designs by the experimenter. This end state information was provided either in the form of photographs, or the presence of actual towers. High fidelity matching to these end states was apparent in both demonstration conditions, even for a design that was demonstrably suboptimal with regard to the goal of the task (maximizing tower height). We conclude that, although high fidelity transmission is likely to be implicated in cumulative culture, action copying is not always necessary for this to occur. Furthermore, since chimpanzees apparently copy behavioral processes and well as products, and also transmit behavior with high fidelity, the stark absence of unequivocal examples of cumulative culture in nonhumans may be attributable to factors other than imitative ability.",1.52,125

An essay of a long term reflection.,"['Robillard PY', 'Hulsey TC', 'Dekker GA', 'Chaouat G']",Journal of reproductive immunology,2003,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP: pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia) affect approximately 10% of human births. Women are at increased risk for HDP during their first conception; and/or when the conception is with a new partner (new paternity); when conception occurs very shortly after the beginning of their sexual relationship. A primary cause of preeclampsia is the defect of the normal human-specific deep endovascular invasion of trophoblast, which is a consequence of the nutritional demands of growth of the human fetal brain. The occurrence of preeclampsia represents a reproductive disadvantage unique to humans compared with other mammals. As such, it may have played a significant role in shaping human reproduction and, therefore, human sexuality. This deep implantation/preeclampsia phenomenon may explain many anthropological mysteries of human sexuality that do not exist in other mammalian species (and primates). These include: very low fertility rate, concealed ovulation, all year long 'apparent-waste-of-efficiency' sexuality, absence of sperm competition in human females at the time of conception, and the unexplained testicle size in human males compared with relevant primates. Further, this deep trophoblastic implantation (and its failure in preeclampsia) in humans might be a decisive condition of hominization between great apes and all the other Homo genuses. This frontier might even have occurred inside these Homo lineages: because of their relatively small brains, the first species of Homo might not have presented the deep trophoblastic invasion described in Homo sapiens.",2.815,1726

However, obtaining an accurate prediction is not always a simple task and can be modeled as a problem of classification between positive sequences (protein codifiers) and negative sequences (non-codifiers). The problem is highly imbalanced because each molecule of mRNA has a unique translation initiation site and various others that are not initiators. Therefore, this study focuses on the problem from the perspective of balancing classes and we present an undersampling balancing method, M-clus, which is based on clustering. The method also adds features to sequences and improves the performance of the classifier through the inclusion of knowledge obtained by the model, called InAKnow. RESULTS: Through this methodology, the measures of performance used (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and adjusted accuracy) are greater than 93% for the Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus organisms, and varied between 72.97% and 97.43% for the other organisms evaluated: Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Nasonia vitripennis. The precision increases significantly by 39% and 22.9% for Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus, respectively, when the knowledge obtained by the model is included. For the other organisms, the precision increases by between 37.10% and 59.49%. The inclusion of certain features during training, for example, the presence of ATG in the upstream region of the Translation Initiation Site, improves the rate of sensitivity by approximately 7%. Using the M-Clus balancing method generates a significant increase in the rate of sensitivity from 51.39% to 91.55% (Mus musculus) and from 47.45% to 88.09% (Rattus norvegicus).

Philosophers have discussed at length the various attributes of consciousness. At the same time, most of the philosophical or scientific frameworks have directly or indirectly implied mind-body duality. It is now imperative that we develop an integrated approach to understand the interconnection between mind and consciousness on one hand and brain on the other. This paper begins with the proposition that the structure of the brain is analogous, at least to certain extent, to that of the computer system. Of course, it is much more sophisticated and complex. The second proposition is that the Chomskyean concept of 'mental organs' is a good working hypothesis that tries to characterise this complexity in terms of an innate cognitive framework. By following this dual approach, brain as a data processing system and brain as a superstructure of intricately linked mental organs, we can move toward a better understanding of 'mind' within the framework of empirical science. The one 'mental organ' studied extensively in Chomskyean terms is 'language faculty' which is unique in its relation to brain, mind and consciousness.",0,1629

The results of Study 1 showed that 4-year-old children and chimpanzees were very similar in their ability to monitor two identical devices and to sequentially switch between the two to collect a reward, and that they were less successful at doing so than 5-year-old children. In Study 2, which required subjects to alternate between two different tasks, one of which had rewards continuously available whereas the other one only occasionally released rewards, no species differences were found.

Living under high UVR near the equator, ancestral Homo sapiens had skin rich in protective eumelanin. Dispersals outside of the tropics were associated with positive selection for depigmentation to maximize cutaneous biosynthesis of pre-vitamin D(3) under low and highly seasonal UVB conditions. In recent centuries, migrations and high-speed transportation have brought many people into UVR regimes different from those experienced by their ancestors and, accordingly, exposed them to new disease risks. These have been increased by urbanization and changes in diet and lifestyle. Three examples-nutritional rickets, multiple sclerosis (MS) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM)-are chosen to illustrate the serious health effects of mismatches between skin pigmentation and UVR. The aetiology of MS in particular provides insight into complex and contingent interactions of genetic and environmental factors necessary to trigger lethal disease states.

Only social bonding predicted the occurrence, frequency, and latency of yawn contagion. As with other measures of empathy, the rate of contagion was greatest in response to kin, then friends, then acquaintances, and lastly strangers. Related individuals (r>/=0.25) showed the greatest contagion, in terms of both occurrence of yawning and frequency of yawns. Strangers and acquaintances showed a longer delay in the yawn response (latency) compared to friends and kin. This outcome suggests that the neuronal activation magnitude related to yawn contagion can differ as a function of subject familiarity.

Initially, humans and monkeys showed indifference between the two options of either staying with their initial choice or switching. With experience, members of both species learned to use the switch strategy at above chance levels, but there were individual differences with only approximately half of the participants in each species learning to choose the more optimal response.

Accidental genetic modifications and their innovative results make the successful adaptation possible. As we know the human evolution started 7-8 million years ago in the African savannah, where upright position and bipedalism were significantly advantageous. The main drive of improving manual actions and tool making could be to obtain more food. Our ancestor got more meat due to more successful hunting, resulting in more caloric intake, more protein and essential fatty acid in the meal. The nervous system uses disproportionally high level of energy, so better quality of food was a basic condition for the evolution of huge human brain. The size of human brain was tripled during 3.5 million years, it increased from the average of 450 cm3 of Australopithecinae to the average of 1350 cm3 of Homo sapiens. A genetic change in the system controlling gene expression could happen about 200 000 years ago, which influenced the development of nervous system, the sensorimotor function and learning ability for motor processes. The appearance and stabilisation of FOXP2 gene structure as feature of modern man coincided with the first presence and quick spread of Homo sapiens on the whole Earth. This genetic modification made opportunity for human language, as the basis of abrupt evolution of human intelligence. The brain region being responsible for human language is the left planum temporale, which is much larger in left hemisphere. This shows the most typical human brain asymmetry. In this case the anatomical asymmetry means a clearly defined functional asymmetry as well, where the brain hemispheres act differently. The preference in using hands, the lateralised using of tools resulted in the brain asymmetry, which is the precondition of human language and intelligence.

 States of America",2006,"At the center of the debate on the emergence of modern humans and their spread throughout the globe is the question of whether archaic Homo lineages contributed to the modern human gene pool, and more importantly, whether such contributions impacted the evolutionary adaptation of our species. A major obstacle to answering this question is that low levels of admixture with archaic lineages are not expected to leave extensive traces in the modern human gene pool because of genetic drift. Loci that have undergone strong positive selection, however, offer a unique opportunity to identify low-level admixture with archaic lineages, provided that the introgressed archaic allele has risen to high frequency under positive selection. The gene microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size during development and has experienced positive selection in the lineage leading to Homo sapiens. Within modern humans, a group of closely related haplotypes at this locus, known as haplogroup D, rose from a single copy approximately 37,000 years ago and swept to exceptionally high frequency (approximately 70% worldwide today) because of positive selection. Here, we examine the origin of haplogroup D. By using the interhaplogroup divergence test, we show that haplogroup D likely originated from a lineage separated from modern humans approximately 1.1 million years ago and introgressed into humans by approximately 37,000 years ago. This finding supports the possibility of admixture between modern humans and archaic Homo populations (Neanderthals being one possibility). Furthermore, it buttresses the important notion that, through such adminture, our species has benefited evolutionarily by gaining new advantageous alleles. The interhaplogroup divergence test developed here may be broadly applicable to the detection of introgression at other loci in the human genome or in genomes of other species.",9.674,273

This work reports an electrochemical method for gene-specific methylation detection and MTase activity assay using HpaII endonuclease to improve selectivity and employing signal amplification of graphene oxide (GO) to enhance the assay sensitivity. The method was developed by designing a probe DNA, which was immobilized on electrode surface, to hybridize with target DNA (one 137 mer DNA from exon 8 promoter region of the Homo sapiens p53 gene, was extracted from HCT116 cells). The assay is based on the electrochemical responses of the reporter (thionine), which was conjugated to 3'-terminus of the probe DNA via GO, after the DNA hybrid was methylated (under catalysis of M.SssI MTase) and cleaved by HpaII endonuclease (a site-specific endonuclease recognizing the duplex symmetrical sequence of 5'-CCGG-3' and catalyzing cleavage between the cytosines). This model can determine DNA methylation at the site of CpG and has an ability to discriminate the target DNA sequence from even single-base mismatched sequence. The electrochemical signal has a linear relationship with M.SssI activities ranging from 0.1 to 450 U/mL with a detection limit of ~(0.05 +/- 0.02) U/mL at a signal/noise of 3. The advantages of this assay are ease of performance having a good specificity and selectivity.

Meanwhile, over the past five decades the exceptionalist view of Homo sapiens inherent in the social and religious traditions of the West has similarly undergone radical changes. H. sapiens is now best understood as a microecosystem integrated into a much broader ecosystem: the biosphere. That human microecosystem is composed of constituents derived from the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryan domains via endosymbiotic, commensalistic and mutualistic interactions. This amalgamation of 100 trillion cells and viral elements is regulated by a composite genome aggregated over the 3.8 billion years of evolutionary history of organic life. No component of H. sapiens or its genome can be identified as irreducibly and exclusively human. H. sapiens' humanity is an emergent property of the microecosystem. Ironically as H. sapiens is viewed by evolutionary science in a highly integrated manner medicine approaches it as a balkanized, deaggregated entity through the eye of 150 different specialties. To effectively address the needs of H sapiens in its role as patient by the same species in its role as physician the disparate views must be harmonized.

The common property of these two protein families is a complex domain organization that combines species-specific regions, commonly occurring domains and disordered segments. Besides highlighting promising novel drug target candidates in M. tuberculosis, the presented analysis can also be viewed as a general protocol to identify proteins involved in species-specific functions in a given organism.

Sperm DNA fragmentation of samples exposed to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide was assessed by means of the two-tailed comet assay. The sperm DNA of the marsupial species studied were significantly more sensitive to oxidative stress than the spermatozoa of eutherian species. Such susceptibility is consistent with the lack of disulfide cross-linking in marsupial sperm chromatin and suggests that the oxidation of thiols to disulfides for chromatin condensation during epididymal transit in eutherian mammals is likely to be important in order to provide stability and protect these cells from the genotoxic effects of adverse environments.",2.4,1574

Here we report that Upper Palaeolithic-Mesolithic H. sapiens shared an identical dental development pattern with modern humans, but that H. antecessor and H. heidelbergensis had shorter periods of dental growth. Surprisingly, Neanderthals were characterized by having the shortest period of dental growth. Because dental growth is an excellent indicator of somatic development, our results suggest that Neanderthals developed faster even than their immediate ancestor, H. heidelbergensis. Dental growth became longer and brain size increased from the Plio-Pleistocene in hominid evolution. Neanderthals, despite having a large brain, were characterized by a short period of development.

Since causal mutations are generally not included in genomic marker data, LD between those and available markers is essential for capturing the effects of causal loci on localizing genes responsible for traits. Thus, the interpretation of association studies requires a detailed knowledge of LD patterns. It is well known that most LD measures depend on minor allele frequencies (MAF) of the considered loci and the magnitude of LD is influenced by the physical distances between loci. In the present study, a procedure to compare the LD structure between genomic regions comprising several markers each is suggested. The approach accounts for different scaling factors, namely the distribution of MAF, the distribution of pair-wise differences in MAF, and the physical extent of compared regions, reflected by the distribution of pair-wise physical distances. In the first step, genomic regions are matched based on similarity in these scaling factors. In the second step, chromosome- and genome-wide significance tests for differences in medians of LD measures in each pair are performed. The proposed framework was applied to test the hypothesis that the average LD is different in genic and non-genic regions. This was tested with a genome-wide approach with data sets for humans (Homo sapiens), a highly selected chicken line (Gallus gallus domesticus) and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In all three data sets we found a significantly higher level of LD in genic regions compared to non-genic regions. About 31% more LD was detected genome-wide in genic compared to non-genic regions in Arabidopsis thaliana, followed by 13.6% in human and 6% chicken. Chromosome-wide comparison discovered significant differences on all 5 chromosomes in Arabidopsis thaliana and on one third of the human and of the chicken chromosomes.",3.234,829

3107397,Evolution of the lumbosacral angle.,[],American journal of physical anthropology,1987,"The lumbosacral angle (LSA) was studied in 131 children ranging in age from birth to 5 years. This angle increases from an average of 20 degrees at birth to an average of 70 degrees at the age of 5 years; it remains at that level thereafter. This study demonstrates that the formation of the LSA is not related to increasing age, height, or weight. Nor do obstetrical requirements seems to play any major role in the formation of the lumbosacral angle. Rather, it appears that the development of the LSA is related to the progressive acquisition of erect posture and the ontogeny of bipedal locomotion. This angle is almost nil in the nonprimate mammals (who only infrequently stand erect). It is minimal in monkeys who occasionally assume bipedal postures and increases somewhat in living apes who engage in facultative bipedal positional behavior. In the early australopithecines, the LSA is increased over that in apes, and it reaches its maximum in Homo sapiens. Deviations from normal and healthy erect posture in Homo sapiens result in corresponding changes in the lumbosacral angle. Lumbar and sacral angles (both forming the lumbosacral angle) are almost equal in all mammalian species. Since the sacral angle of Australopithecus afarensis is approximately 15 degrees, it can be implied that its lumbosacral angle was small, thus attesting to its",2.379,1770

In plants, programmed cell death is necessary for development and the hypersensitive response to stress or pathogenic infection. A common feature in programmed cell death across organisms is the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. To better understand the role of cytochrome c in the onset of programmed cell death in plants, a proteomic approach was developed based on affinity chromatography and using Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome c as bait. Using this approach, ten putative new cytochrome c partners were identified. Of these putative partners and as indicated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation, nine of them bind the heme protein in plant protoplasts and human cells as a heterologous system. The in vitro interaction between cytochrome c and such soluble cytochrome c-targets was further corroborated using surface plasmon resonance. Taken together, the results obtained in the study indicate that Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome c interacts with several distinct proteins involved in protein folding, translational regulation, cell death, oxidative stress, DNA damage, energetic metabolism, and mRNA metabolism. Interestingly, some of these novel Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome c-targets are closely related to those for Homo sapiens cytochrome c (Martinez-Fabregas et al., unpublished). These results indicate that the evolutionarily well-conserved cytosolic cytochrome c, appearing in organisms from plants to mammals, interacts with a wide range of targets on programmed cell death.

LASS2/TMSG-1 could directly interact with the C subunit of Vacuolar H(+) ATPase (V-ATPase), which suggested that LASS2/TMSG1 might inhibit the invasion and metastasis through regulating the function of V-ATPase. In this study, we explored the effect of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting LASS2/TMSG1 on the invasion and metastasis of human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3M-2B4 with low metastatic potential and its functional interaction with V-ATPase. Silencing of LASS2/TMSG1 gene in PC-3M-2B4 cells increased V-ATPase activity, extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and in turn the activation of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9, which coincided with enhancing cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell invasion in vitro, as well as acceleration of prostate cancer (PCA) growth and lymph node metastases in vivo.

Although EBLNs are non-transposable, they share some features with retrotransposons. Here, to test whether hosts control the expression of EBLNs similarly to retrotransposons, we profiled the transcription of all Homo sapiens EBLNs (hsEBLN-1 to hsEBLN-7). We could detect transcription of all hsEBLNs in at least one tissue. Among them, hsEBLN-1 is transcribed almost exclusively in the testis. In most tissues, expression from the hsEBLN-1 locus is silenced epigenetically. Finally, we showed the possibility that hsEBLN-1 integration at this locus affects the expression of a neighboring gene.

Despite its ubiquity and functional importance, the specific origins of this unique amino acid have eluded characterization. In this study, we describe the discovery and characterization of two enzyme pairs consisting of a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-linked aminotransferase and an unprecedented isomerase synergistically responsible for the biosynthesis of L-allo-Ile from L-isoleucine (L-Ile) in natural products. DsaD/DsaE from the desotamide biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces scopuliridis SCSIO ZJ46, and MfnO/MfnH from the marformycin biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces drozdowiczii SCSIO 10141 drive L-allo-Ile generation in each respective system. In vivo gene inactivations validated the importance of the DsaD/DsaE pair and MfnO/MfnH pair in L-allo-Ile unit biosynthesis. Inactivation of PLP-linked aminotransferases DsaD and MfnO led to significantly diminished desotamide and marformycin titers, respectively. Additionally, inactivation of the isomerase genes dsaE and mfnH completely abolished production of all L-allo-Ile-containing metabolites in both biosynthetic pathways. Notably, in vitro biochemical assays revealed that DsaD/DsaE and MfnO/MfnH each catalyze a bidirectional reaction between L-allo-Ile and L-Ile. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the enzymatic reaction involves a PLP-linked ketimine intermediate and uses an arginine residue from the C-terminus of each isomerase to epimerize the amino acid beta-position. Consequently, these data provide important new insight into the origins of L-allo-Ile in natural products with medicinal potential and illuminate new possibilities for biotool development.",12.113,744
19249816,Is Homo heidelbergensis a distinct species? New insight on the Mauer mandible.,"['Mounier A', 'Marchal F', 'Condemi S']",Journal of human evolution,2009,"The discovery of new fossils in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and the recognition of a greater diversity in the middle Pleistocene fossil record, has led to a reconsideration of the species Homo heidelbergensis. This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen's inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. However, the results of this study fail to entirely discount the hypothesis that considers H. heidelbergensis as a chronospecies leading to the Neandertals.",3.733,1589

Proximal tubular epithelial cells are the main sites of MK expression in the kidneys. The pathophysiological roles of MK are diverse, ranging from the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) to the progression of chronic kidney disease, often accompanied by hypertension, renal ischaemia and diabetic nephropathy. The obvious hypertension that develops in Mdk(+/+) mouse models of renal ablation compared with Mdk(-/-) mice eventually leads to progressive renal failure, such as glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage associated with elevated plasma angiotensin (Ang) II levels. MK is also induced in the lung endothelium by oxidative stress and subsequently up-regulated by ACE, which hydrolyzes Ang II to induce further oxidative stress, thus accelerating MK generation; this leads to a vicious cycle of positive feedback in the MK-Ang II pathway. Kidney-lung interactions involving positive feedback between the renin-angiotensin system and MK might partly account for the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney damage. MK is also involved in the pathogenesis of AKI and diabetic nephropathy through the recruitment of inflammatory cells. In contrast, MK plays a protective role against crescentic glomerulonephritis, by down-regulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These diverse actions of MK might open up new avenues for targeted approaches to treating hypertension and various renal diseases.

Here, we report the identification of 53 human-specific NumtS by inspection of the UCSC genome browser, showing that they may be direct insertions of mitochondrial DNA into the human nuclear DNA after the human-chimpanzee split. In silico analyses allowed us to identify 14 NumtS which are polymorphic in terms of their presence/absence within the human genome in individuals of different ancestry. The allele frequencies of these polymorphic NumtS were calculated for 1000 Genomes Project sequence data from 13 populations worldwide, and principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering methods allowed the detection of strong signals of geographical structure related to the genetic diversity of these loci. All identified polymorphic human-specific NumtS together with a tandemly duplicated NumtS have also been validated by PCR amplification on a panel of 60 samples belonging to five native populations worldwide, confirming the expected NumtS variability.

Thus, the classic phylogenetic differences are reflected also by the distribution of NCA. Hyperimmunization of Macaca irus, in which the NCA content of serum and cells is low, led to occurrence of anti-NCA IgG in all animals. The phylogenetic differences may accordingly have to do with slight antigenic NCA differences between Homo and other Primates rather than differences in amount only.

While the cognitive, social, and evolutionary implications of this phenomenon have been emphasised, the statistical basis of a mean inference of EQ in the Neandertal hypodigm has not been appropriately demonstrated. A demonstrable male bias in the available postcranial, not cranial, series has skewed perceptions of Neandertal brain-to-body size scaling towards a rejection of the null hypothesis. A simple resolution to this problem is a concise assessment of paired associated covariates against a suitable recent human comparator series. Permutations of Fisher's z and Student's t statistics are valid metrics in tests of significance in single datum hypotheses. Bootstrapped single observation tests determined significance in body size, absolute and relative endocranial volume in Pleistocene archaic, early modern, and late Pleistocene H. sapiens. With respect to absolute ECV, all current Middle-Upper Pleistocene crania fall within the substantial recent Homo range. Nevertheless, simple indices derived from raw and modified data in normal and logarithmic space reveal that Western European Neandertal males approach the lower extremes of our observed size range in relative ECV, yet none exceed statistical significance. Results confirm that relative ECV/brain size in Neandertals was not significantly depressed relative to recent and fossil H. sapiens and this is consistent with a substantial body of data from living humans dismissing any simple correspondence of relative brain size with intelligence and, by extension, evolutionary success.",0,136

The recent availability of complete genome data of pathogenic strains of the S. enterica gives new avenues for the identification of drug targets and drug candidates. We have used the genomic and metabolic pathway data to identify pathways and proteins essential to the pathogen and absent from the host. METHODS: We took the whole proteome sequence data of 42 strains of S. enterica and Homo sapiens along with KEGG-annotated metabolic pathway data, clustered proteins sequences using CD-HIT, identified essential genes using DEG database and discarded S. enterica homologs of human proteins in unique metabolic pathways (UMPs) and characterized hypothetical proteins with SVM-prot and InterProScan. Through this core proteomic analysis we have identified enzymes essential to the pathogen. RESULTS: The identification of 73 enzymes common in 42 strains of S. enterica is the real strength of the current study. We proposed all 73 unexplored enzymes as potential drug targets against the infections caused by the S. enterica. The study is comprehensive around S. enterica and simultaneously considered every possible pathogenic strain of S. enterica. This comprehensiveness turned the current study significant since, to the best of our knowledge it is the first subtractive core proteomic analysis of the unique metabolic pathways applied to any pathogen for the identification of drug targets. We applied extensive computational methods to shortlist few potential drug targets considering the druggability criteria e.g. Non-homologous to the human host, essential to the pathogen and playing significant role in essential metabolic pathways of the pathogen (i.e. S. enterica). In the current study, the subtractive proteomics through a novel approach was applied i.e. by considering only proteins of the unique metabolic pathways of the pathogens and mining the proteomic data of all completely sequenced strains of the pathogen, thus improving the quality and application of the results.

Superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior cortical thicknesses were automatically measured directly from these digital images. Throughout the femoral neck H. sapiens displays thin superior cortical bone and inferior cortical bone that thickens distally. In marked contrast, cortical bone in the femoral neck of African apes is more uniformly thick in all directions, with even greater thickening of the superior cortical bone distally. Because the femoral neck acts as a cantilevered beam, its anchorage at the neck-shaft junction is subjected to the highest bending stresses and is the most biomechanically relevant region to inspect for response to strain. As evinced by A.L. 128-1, A.L. 211-1 and MAK-VP-1/1, Australopithecus afarensis is indistinguishable from H. sapiens, but markedly different from African apes in cortical bone distribution at the femoral neck-shaft junction. Cortical distribution in the African ape indicates much greater variation in loading conditions consistent with their more varied locomotor repertoire. Cortical distribution in hominids is a response to the more stereotypic loading pattern imposed by habitual bipedality, and thin superior cortex in A. afarensis confirms the absence of a significant arboreal component in its locomotor repertoire.",2.379,1818

Although the study of human mitochondrial DNAs supported this single-origin and complete-replacement model, a recent paper(1) argues that humans expanded out of Africa more than once and regionally interbred. However, both the genetic antiquity and the impact of the African contribution to modern Homo sapiens are so great as to view Africa as a central place of human evolution. Despite the possibility that out-of-Africa H. sapiens interbred with other populations, this evidence is more consistent with the uniregional hypothesis than the multiregional hypothesis of modern human origins.",0,1888

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is characterized by the t(2;13) or t(1;13) chromosomal translocations, which generate the PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 fusion genes, respectively. The oncogenic activity of PAX3-FOXO1 has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, yet expression of the fusion protein alone in primary myoblasts or a mouse model is insufficient for tumorigenic transformation. To identify genes cooperating with PAX3-FOXO1 in ARMS tumorigenesis, we generated a retroviral complementary DNA (cDNA) expression library from the Rh30 ARMS cell line. Arf-/- myoblasts expressing PAX3-FOXO1 and the retroviral cDNA library rapidly formed tumors after subcutaneous injection into NOD-SCID mice. Tumors formed by Arf-/-/PAX3-FOXO1/MarX-library myoblasts contained an unknown cDNA, encoding the C-terminus of the Homo sapiens hypothetical protein, FLJ10404, herein named IRIZIO. Expression of full length IRIZIO cDNA also cooperated with PAX3-FOXO1 in the transformation of Arf-/- myoblasts. Given that IRIZIO is expressed at increased levels in RMS, it might contribute to rhabdomyosarcomagenesis in humans.",5.334,1528

The kinesin-13 motor protein MCAK is a potent microtubule depolymerase. The divergent non-motor regions flanking the ATPase domain are critical in regulating its targeting and activity. However, the molecular basis for the function of the non-motor regions within the context of full-length MCAK is unknown. Here, we determine the structure of MCAK motor domain bound to its regulatory C-terminus. Our analysis reveals that the MCAK C-terminus binds to two motor domains in solution and is displaced allosterically upon microtubule binding, which allows its robust accumulation at microtubule ends. These results demonstrate that MCAK undergoes long-range conformational changes involving its C-terminus during the soluble to microtubule-bound transition and that the C-terminus-motor interaction represents a structural intermediate in the MCAK catalytic cycle. Together, our work reveals intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of kinesin-13 activity.",9.322,589

Vervets, which have the smallest interaural distance of the species that we tested, exhibited the greatest high-frequency sensitivity. This result is consistent with Masterton, Heffner, and Ravizza's (1969) observations that head size and high-frequency acuity are inversely correlated in mammals. Vervets were also the most sensitive in the middle frequency range. Furthermore, we found that de Brazza's monkeys, though they produce a specialized, low-pitched boom call, did not show the enhanced low-frequency sensitivity that Brown and Waser (1984) showed for blue monkeys (C. mitis), a species with a similar sound. This discrepancy may be related to differences in the acoustics of the respective habitats of these animals or in the way their boom calls are used. The acuity of Japanese monkeys was found to closely resemble that of rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) that were tested in previous studies. Finally, humans tested in the same apparatus exhibited normative sensitivities.

The ESI (eukarya-specific insertion 1) in the CP1 domain of GlLeuRS (Giardia lamblia LeuRS) has been identified. Similar substitution with the ESI from HsLeuRS (Homo sapiens LeuRS) impeded the leucine activation, aminoacylation and post-transfer editing of the enzyme, but had no effect on the editing specificity toward non-specific amino acids. Thr341 in GlLeuRS served as a specificity discriminator, as found in other LeuRS systems, although its substitution with an alanine residue did not destroy Leu-tRNALeu synthesis in vitro and in vivo. The Arg338 was crucial for tRNALeu charging and the Asp440 was crucial for leucine activation and aminoacylation. The post-transfer editing required the CTD (C-terminal domain), Arg338 and Asp440 of GlLeuRS. Interestingly, GlLeuRS was completely resistant to the AN2690, which is an inhibitor of various LeuRSs. The universally conserved aspartate residue in the LeuRS CP1 domains was responsible for the resistance of GlLeuRS and another recently reported AN2690-resistant AaLeuRS (Aquifex aeolicus LeuRS).

In order to understand the role of the interaction between LASS2 and V-ATPase in HCC cell growth, we transiently transfected plasmid pCMV-HA2-LASS2 into HCCLM3, a HCC cell line without the significant expression of endogenous LASS2. The pH-sensitive fluorescence probes, BCECF and BCECF-AM, were used to measure the intracellular and extracellular H(+) concentrations of HCCLM3 cells respectively. The effect of LASS2 gene on apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin-V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI) by flow cytometry. Western blot was used to detect cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the cytosol and mitochondria, as well as pro-caspase-3 in cytosol. The results showed that the cell growth of LASS2-transfected HCCLM3 cells was significantly inhibited compared with that of the mock control. LASS2 transfection increased intracellular H(+) concentration of HCCLM3 cells, while decreased extracellular H(+) concentration. Moreover, LASS2 transfection significantly enhanced the apoptosis of HCCLM3 cells. In LASS2-transfected cells, the amounts of Cyt c increased in the cytosol, while decreased in the mitochondria.

Four female spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) and twelve human subjects (Homo sapiens) tested in parallel were found to detect the same six odorants at concentrations <0.01 ppm, and with four of the six odorants the best-scoring animals and subjects even detected concentrations <10 ppt. With all three species, the threshold values obtained here are generally lower than (or in the lower range of) those reported for other chemical classes tested previously, suggesting that sulfur-containing odorants may play a special role in olfaction. Across-species comparisons showed that the mice were significantly more sensitive than the human subjects and the spider monkeys with four of the six predator odorants. However, the human subjects were significantly more sensitive than the mice with the remaining two odorants. Human subjects and spider monkeys significantly differed in their sensitivity with only two of the six odorants. These comparisons lend further support to the notion that the number of functional olfactory receptor genes or the relative or absolute size of the olfactory bulbs are poor predictors of a species' olfactory sensitivity.

Bones of the vault are in fact quite thick, and the cranium is small.

Unfortunately, the facial skeleton and frontal bone are very incomplete, and little useful information can be obtained from these parts of the existing reconstruction. The parietals are also damaged, but the left temporal is more satisfactorily preserved, and the occiput is nearly complete. Occipital morphology, mastoid shape, and characteristics of the glenoid cavity and tympanic plate probably provide the best available guide to affinities of the Ndutu hominid. In many of these features the cranium resembles Broken Hill, Elandsfontein, and other African fossils referred to archaic H. sapiens. There are some similarities to modern humans also, but no ties to the Neanderthals of Europe.

We examined wide-scale geographic variation in the behavior of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) across five long-term field sites in Central America using a well established ethnographic cross-site survey method. Spider monkeys possess a relatively rare social system with a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics, also typical of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans (Homo sapiens). From the initial 62 behaviors surveyed 65% failed to meet the necessary criteria for traditions. The remaining 22 behaviors showed cross-site variation in occurrence ranging from absent through to customary, representing to our knowledge, the first documented cases of traditions in this taxon and only the second case of multiple traditions in a New World monkey species. Of the 22 behavioral variants recorded across all sites, on average 57% occurred in the social domain, 19% in food-related domains and 24% in other domains. This social bias contrasts with the food-related bias reported in great ape cross-site comparison studies and has implications for the evolution of human culture.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are identified through various experimental methods and are stored in curated databases. The noisiness of the existing PPI data is evident, and it is essential that a more reliable data is generated. Furthermore, the selection of a set of PPIs at different confidence levels might be necessary for many studies. Although different methodologies were introduced to evaluate the confidence scores for binary interactions, a highly reliable, almost complete PPI network of Homo sapiens is not proposed yet. The quality and coverage of human protein interactome need to be improved to be used in various disciplines, especially in biomedicine. In the present work, we propose an unsupervised statistical approach to assign confidence scores to PPIs of H. sapiens. To achieve this goal PPI data from six different databases were collected and a total of 295,288 non-redundant interactions between 15,950 proteins were acquired. The present scoring system included the context information that was assigned to PPIs derived from eight biological attributes. A high confidence network, which included 147,923 binary interactions between 13,213 proteins, had scores greater than the cutoff value of 0.80, for which sensitivity, specificity, and coverage were 94.5%, 80.9%, and 82.8%, respectively. We compared the present scoring method with others for evaluation. Reducing the noise inherent in experimental PPIs via our scoring scheme increased the accuracy significantly.

25077818,Towards a HPC-oriented parallel implementation of a learning algorithm for bioinformatics applications.,[],BMC bioinformatics,2014,"BACKGROUND: The huge quantity of data produced in Biomedical research needs sophisticated algorithmic methodologies for its storage, analysis, and processing. High Performance Computing (HPC) appears as a magic bullet in this challenge. However, several hard to solve parallelization and load balancing problems arise in this context. Here we discuss the HPC-oriented implementation of a general purpose learning algorithm, originally conceived for DNA analysis and recently extended to treat uncertainty on data (U-BRAIN). The U-BRAIN algorithm is a learning algorithm that finds a Boolean formula in disjunctive normal form (DNF), of approximately minimum complexity, that is consistent with a set of data (instances) which may have missing bits. The conjunctive terms of the formula are computed in an iterative way by identifying, from the given data, a family of sets of conditions that must be satisfied by all the positive instances and violated by all the negative ones; such conditions allow the computation of a set of coefficients (relevances) for each attribute (literal), that form a probability distribution, allowing the selection of the term literals. The great versatility that characterizes it, makes U-BRAIN applicable in many of the fields in which there are data to be analyzed. However the memory and the execution time required by the running are of O(n(3)) and of O(n(5)) order, respectively, and so, the algorithm is unaffordable for huge data sets. RESULTS: We find mathematical and programming solutions able to lead us towards the implementation of the algorithm U-BRAIN on parallel computers. First we give a Dynamic Programming model of the U-BRAIN algorithm, then we minimize the representation of the relevances. When the data are of great size we are forced to use the mass memory, and depending on where the data are actually stored, the access times can be quite different. According to the evaluation of algorithmic efficiency based on the Disk Model, in order to reduce the costs of the communications between different memories (RAM, Cache, Mass, Virtual) and to achieve efficient I/O performance, we design a mass storage structure able to access its data with a high degree of temporal and spatial locality. Then we develop a parallel implementation of the algorithm. We model it as a SPMD system together to a Message-Passing Programming Paradigm. Here, we adopt the high-level message-passing systems MPI (Message Passing Interface) in the version for the Java programming language, MPJ. The parallel processing is organized into four stages: partitioning, communication, agglomeration and mapping. The decomposition of the U-BRAIN algorithm determines the necessity of a communication protocol design among the processors involved. Efficient synchronization design is also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of a collaboration between public and private institutions, the parallel model of U-BRAIN has been implemented and tested on the INTEL XEON E7xxx and E5xxx family of the CRESCO structure of Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), developed in the framework of the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI), a series of efforts to provide access to high-throughput computing resources across Europe using grid computing techniques. The implementation is able to minimize both the memory space and the execution time. The test data used in this study are IPDATA (Irvine Primate splice- junction DATA set), a subset of HS3D (Homo Sapiens Splice Sites Dataset) and a subset of COSMIC (the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer). The execution time and the speed-up on IPDATA reach the best values within about 90 processors. Then the parallelization advantage is balanced by the greater cost of non-local communications between the processors. A similar behaviour is evident on HS3D, but at a greater number of processors, so evidencing the direct relationship between data size and parallelization gain. This behaviour is confirmed on COSMIC. Overall, the results obtained show that the parallel version is up to 30 times faster than the serial one.",2.576,1009

Although previous studies have elucidated the impact of glucocorticoids on these cells' specific gene expression the exact differential transcriptomes and comprehensive gene expression profiles remain unknown. Using microarray-based platforms we investigated the transcriptome patterns before and after hydrocortisone administration of bone microvascular endothelial cells from human femoral head. Our results highlight the involvement of development differentiation and apoptosis in the bone microvascular endothelial cells. Elucidation of differential gene expression before and after hydrocortisone administration emphasizes the importance of regulatory networks to gene co-expression within biological processes induced by glucocorticoids. With Benjamini-Hochberg characterization we identified 73 up-regulated and 166 down-regulated long noncoding RNAs the expression of 107 of which significantly correlated with 172 mRNAs after administration of hydrocortisone. Transcriptome analysis of bone microvascular endothelial cells from human femoral head samples is highly informative because it is deduced from data comprised of large number of genes expressed above background.

Here it is examined in the light of current neuroscientific and archaeological understanding, and it is shown that the most parsimonious explanation is via the domestication hypothesis of recent humans. Accordingly, rapid atrophy of the brain is partly explained by the culturally based process of sexual selection, first detectable in late robust Homo sapiens perhaps 40,000 years ago. Furthermore it is suggested that this deleterious process of neotenization and brain atrophy was compensated for by the concurrent development of exograms, i.e. means of storing memory outside the brain. Consequently most of human memory and cultural information is now stored external to the brain, which has altered that organ significantly and facilitated a cultural complexity that would be impossible to maintain by biological memory alone. The escalating use of exograms, neotenization and reduction in cranial volume all appear to co-occur with numerous other changes to the human genome.",0,253

Nucleotide sequences for 24 representative human KIR haplotypes were determined. With three previously defined haplotypes, this gave a set of 12 group A and 15 group B haplotypes for assessment of KIR variation. The seven gene-content haplotypes are all combinations of four centromeric and two telomeric motifs. 2DL5, 2DS5 and 2DS3 can be present in centromeric and telomeric locations. With one exception, haplotypes having identical gene content differed in their combinations of KIR alleles. Sequence diversity varied between haplotype groups and between centromeric and telomeric halves of the KIR locus. The most variable A haplotype genes are in the telomeric half, whereas the most variable genes characterizing B haplotypes are in the centromeric half. Of the highly polymorphic genes, only the 3DL3 framework gene exhibits a similar diversity when carried by A and B haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimates, point to the centromeric gene-content motifs that distinguish A and B haplotypes having emerged ~6 million years ago, contemporaneously with the separation of human and chimpanzee ancestors. In contrast, the telomeric motifs that distinguish A and B haplotypes emerged more recently, ~1.7 million years ago, before the emergence of Homo sapiens. Thus the centromeric and telomeric motifs that typify A and B haplotypes have likely been present throughout human evolution. The results suggest the common ancestor of A and B haplotypes combined a B-like centromeric region with an A-like telomeric region.",3.234,1600

RESULTS: A comparative analysis of the genomes of primates, including species in the genus Homo, identified a group of miRNA genes having fixed substitutions with important implications for the evolution of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens denisova. The mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with mutations specific for Homo sapiens denisova exhibited enhanced expression during postnatal brain development in modern humans. By contrast, the expression of mRNAs targeted by miRNAs bearing variations specific for Homo sapiens neanderthalensis was shown to be enhanced in prenatal brain development. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of changes in miRNA gene sequences in the course of Homo sapiens denisova and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis evolution. The genetic alterations of miRNAs regulating the spatiotemporal expression of multiple genes in the prenatal and postnatal brain may contribute to the progressive evolution of brain function, which is consistent with the observations of fine technical and typological properties of tools and decorative items reported from archaeological Denisovan sites. The data also suggest that differential spatial-temporal regulation of gene products promoted by the subspecies-specific mutations in the miRNA genes might have occurred in the brains of Homo sapiens denisova and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, potentially contributing to the cultural differences between these two archaic hominines.",3.986,1

Acinetobacter baylyi is chosen because of its high competence for natural transformation, and its ability to undergo direct homology-based recombination. An in silico comparative analysis of the metabolic pathways of the host Homo sapiens and the pathogen Acinetobacter baylyi was performed by using BLASTp search. This search is against the non-redundant database restricted to the Homo sapiens subset. Sixteen unique pathways identified enlisted a total of 183 drug targets of which 31 belong to the metabolic pathways unique to pathogen having no human homolog. Of these potential drug targets enlisted, RmlA enzyme (d-glucose-1 phosphate thymidylyltransferase) is the first enzyme in the polyketide sugar unit synthesis metabolic pathway, which leads to the formation of l-rhamnose. In gram-negative bacteria, l-rhamnose is one of the important residues of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, a key determinant factor for the virulence of these species. Moreover, these proteins are highly conserved among microorganisms, and therefore, conclusions drawn from the structure of a protein from one species will have strong implications for the corresponding enzyme structure of another origin. Homology modeling of RmlA was performed by MODELLER and the PMDB ID obtained is PM0076419. Further, molecular docking studies were performed for RmlA, which might aid drug design for nosocomial infections.",2.485,1181

For example, the cell cycle is coordinated with the 24 h diurnal rhythm in animals and plants, and with the 40 min ultradian rhythm in budding yeast. To examine the evolution of periodic gene expression during these processes, we performed the first systematic comparison in three organisms (Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by using public microarray data. We observed that although diurnal-regulated and ultradian-regulated genes are not generally cell-cycle-regulated, they tend to have cell-cycle-regulated paralogues. Thus, diverged temporal expression of paralogues seems to facilitate cellular orchestration under different periodic stimuli. Lineage-specific functional repertoires of periodic-associated paralogues imply that this mode of regulation might have evolved independently in several organisms.",9.055,1795

Incorporating this haplotype, the authors estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the Y tree to be 338,000 years ago (95% CI=237,000-581,000). Such an extraordinarily early estimate contradicts all previous estimates in the literature and is over a 100,000 years older than the earliest fossils of anatomically modern humans. This estimate raises two astonishing possibilities, either the novel Y chromosome was inherited after ancestral humans interbred with another species, or anatomically modern Homo sapiens emerged earlier than previously estimated and quickly became subdivided into genetically differentiated subpopulations. We demonstrate that the TMRCA estimate was reached through inadequate statistical and analytical methods, each of which contributed to its inflation. We show that the authors ignored previously inferred Y-specific rates of substitution, incorrectly derived the Y-specific substitution rate from autosomal mutation rates, and compared unequal lengths of the novel Y chromosome with the previously recognized basal lineage. Our analysis indicates that the A00 lineage was derived from all the other lineages 208,300 (95% CI=163,900-260,200) years ago.",2.649,885

To address this problem, we need scalable, cost-effective methods to obtain assemblies with chromosome-scale contiguity. Here we show that genome-wide chromatin interaction data sets, such as those generated by Hi-C, are a rich source of long-range information for assigning, ordering and orienting genomic sequences to chromosomes, including across centromeres. To exploit this finding, we developed an algorithm that uses Hi-C data for ultra-long-range scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies. We demonstrate the approach by combining shotgun fragment and short jump mate-pair sequences with Hi-C data to generate chromosome-scale de novo assemblies of the human, mouse and Drosophila genomes, achieving--for the human genome--98% accuracy in assigning scaffolds to chromosome groups and 99% accuracy in ordering and orienting scaffolds within chromosome groups.

Although it has been reported previously that some miRNAs suppress their target genes on the opposite strand with a fully complementary sequence (i.e., natural antisense miRNAs that act in cis), there is no report to systematically study such cis-antisense miRNAs in different animal species. Here we report that cis-antisense miRNAs do exist in different animal species: 48 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 17 in Drosophila, 36 in Mus musculus, and 52 in Homo sapiens using a systematical bioinformatics approach. We show that most of these cis-antisense miRNAs can efficiently reduce the expression levels of their target genes in human cells. We further investigate hsa-miR-3661, one of the predicted cis-antisense miRNAs, in detail and demonstrate that this miRNA directly targets the coding sequence of PPP2CA located on the opposite DNA strand and inhibits the PPP2CA expression. Taken together, these results indicate that cis-antisense miRNAs are conservative and functional in animal species including humans.",0,620

H. sapiens foragers were present at Batadomba-lena from ca. 36,000 cal BP to the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene. Human occupation was sporadic before the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Batadomba-lena's Late Pleistocene inhabitants foraged for a broad spectrum of plant and mainly arboreal animal resources (monkeys, squirrels and abundant rainforest snails), derived from a landscape that retained equatorial rainforest cover through periods of pronounced regional aridity during the LGM. Juxtaposed hearths, palaeofloors with habitation debris, postholes, excavated pits, and animal and plant remains, including abundant Canarium nutshells, reflect intensive habitation of the rockshelter in times of monsoon intensification and biome reorganisation after ca. 16,000 cal BP. This period corresponds with further broadening of the economic spectrum, evidenced though increased contribution of squirrels, freshwater snails and Canarium nuts in the diet of the rockshelter occupants. Microliths are more abundant and morphologically diverse in the earliest, pre-LGM layer and decline markedly during intensified rockshelter use on the wane of the LGM. We propose that changing toolkits and subsistence base reflect changing foraging practices, from shorter-lived visits of highly mobile foraging bands in the period before the LGM, to intensified use of Batadomba-lena and intense foraging for diverse resources around the site during and, especially, following the LGM. Traces of ochre, marine shell beads and other objects from an 80 km-distant shore, and, possibly burials reflect symbolic practices from the outset of human presence at the rockshelter. Evidence for differentiated use of space (individual hearths, possible habitation structures) is present in LGM and terminal Pleistocene layers. The record of Batadomba-lena demonstrates that Late Pleistocene pathways to (aspects of) behavioural 'modernity' (composite tools, practice of symbolism and ritual, broad spectrum economy) were diverse and ecologically contingent.",3.733,1360

The two lymphoma cell lines were cultured in vitro, using different concentrations of As2S2 for different time periods. The cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Apoptosis was assessed via flow cytometry. Expression levels of the apoptosis-associated genes [Homo sapiens Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), Homo sapiens B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Homo sapiens Bcl-2-like protein 1 (BCL2L1, Bcl-xL), Homo sapiens v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (MYC, c-Myc) and Homo sapiens pim-1 oncogene (PIM)] were measured via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The results demonstrated that As2S2 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in the two lymphoma cell lines in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with the Raji cells being more sensitive to As2S2 compared to Jurkat cells. As2S2 may also alter the expression levels of different apoptosis-associated genes, with the alterations of the mRNA expression levels being different between Raji and Jurkat cells. These findings indicated that As2S2 may inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines and that B-cell lymphoma cell lines are more sensitive compared to T-cell lymphoma cell lines. The possible underlying mechanism is that As2S2 alters the expression levels of the apoptosis-associated genes and activates apoptosis-associated signaling pathways.",0,220

Especially useful is the concept of the adaptive workaround-an adaptation that manages the maladaptive elements of a pre-existing evolutionary constraint. The current review organizes 7 features of human mating into their phylogenetic context and presents evidence that 2 adaptive workarounds played a critical role as Homo sapiens's mating psychology evolved.

Experimental procedures for protein function prediction are low throughput by nature and thus can't be used to keep up with the rate at which new proteins are discovered. On the other hand, proteins are the prominent stakeholders in almost all biological processes, and therefore the need to precisely know their functions for a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanism is inevitable. The challenge of annotating uncharacterized proteins in functional genomics and biology in general motivates the use of computational techniques well orchestrated to accurately predict their functions. METHODS: We propose a computational flow for the functional annotation of a protein able to assign the most probable functions to a protein by aggregating heterogeneous information. Considered information include: protein motifs, protein sequence similarity, and protein homology data gathered from interacting proteins, combined with data from highly similar non-interacting proteins (hereinafter called Similactors). Moreover, to increase the predictive power of our model we also compute and integrate term specific relationships among functional terms based on Gene Ontology (GO). RESULTS: We tested our method on Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and Homo sapiens species proteins. The aggregation of different structural and functional evidence with GO relationships outperforms, in terms of precision and accuracy of prediction than the other methods reported in literature.

Internal consistencies and interrater reliabilities of factors were stable across age groups and approximately 6.8 year retest reliabilities were high. Age-related declines in Extraversion and Openness and increases in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness paralleled human age differences. The mean change in absolute standardized units for all five factors was virtually identical in humans and chimpanzees after adjustment for different developmental rates. Consistent with their aggressive behavior in the wild, male chimpanzees were rated as more aggressive, emotional, and impulsive than females. Chimpanzee sex differences in personality were greater than comparable human gender differences. These findings suggest that chimpanzee and human personality develop via an unfolding maturational process.",1.52,430

The cDNA and the genomic sequence of GAPDH were cloned successfully from the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) using the RT-PCR technology and Touchdown-PCR, respectively. Both sequences were analyzed preliminarily. The cDNA of GAPDH cloned from the Giant Panda is 1191 bp in size, contains an open reading frame of 1002 bp encoding 333 amino acids. The genomic sequence is 3941 bp in length and was found to possess 10 exons and 9 introns. Alignment analysis indicates that the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are highly conserved in some mammalian species, including Homo sapiens, Mu musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis lupus familiaris and Bos taurus. The homologies for the nucleotide sequences of the Giant Panda GAPDH to that of these species are 90.67, 90.92, 90.62, 95.01 and 92.32% respectively, while the homologies for the amino acid sequences are 94.93, 95.5, 95.8, 98.8 and 97.0%. Primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative GAPDH protein is 35.7899 kDa with a theoretical pI of 8.21. Topology prediction showed that there is one Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase active site, two N-glycosylation sites, four Casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, seven Protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and eight N-myristoylation sites in the GAPDH protein of the Giant Panda. The GAPDH gene was overexpressed in E. coli BL21. The results indicated that the fusion of GAPDH with the N-terminally His-tagged form gave rise to the accumulation of an expected 43 kDa polypeptide.

The crucial homology search and DNA strand exchange steps of HR are catalyzed by presynaptic filaments-helical filaments of a recombinase enzyme bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Presynaptic filaments are fundamentally dynamic structures, the assembly, catalytic turnover, and disassembly of which must be closely coordinated with other elements of the DNA recombination, repair, and replication machinery in order for genome maintenance functions to be effective. Here, we reviewed the major dynamic elements controlling the assembly, activity, and disassembly of presynaptic filaments; some intrinsic such as recombinase ATP-binding and hydrolytic activities, others extrinsic such as ssDNA-binding proteins, mediator proteins, and DNA motor proteins. We examined dynamic behavior on multiple levels, including atomic- and filament-level structural changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis as evidenced in crystal structures, as well as subunit binding and dissociation events driven by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We examined the biochemical properties of recombination proteins from four model systems (T4 phage, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens), demonstrating how their properties are tailored for the context-specific requirements in these diverse species. We proposed that the presynaptic filament has evolved to rely on multiple external factors for increased multilevel regulation of HR processes in genomes with greater structural and sequence complexity.",7.714,1507

Unlike other phosphotyrosine proteins, such as CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) and Homo sapiens chromosome 9 open reading frame 10/oxidative stress-associated Src activator (C9orf10/Ossa), which are overexpressed and hyperphosphorylated in scirrhous gastric carcinoma cell lines, ARAP3 was underexpressed in cancerous human gastric tissues. In this study, we found that overexpression of ARAP3 in the scirrhous gastric carcinoma cell lines significantly reduced peritoneal dissemination. In vitro studies also showed that ARAP3 regulated cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, as well as invasive activities. These effects were suppressed by mutations in the Rho-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain or in the C-terminal two tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by Src. Thus, the expression and phosphorylation state of ARAP3 may affect the invasiveness of cancer by modulating cell adhesion and motility.

 : JASS / Istituto italiano di antropologia",2015,"The role of the brain in the somatic development, as well as in the establishment of the different variables of the life history pattern in vertebrates has been largely debated. Moreover, during the last thirty years, dental development has been used as a good proxy to infer different aspects of the life history in hominins, primarily due to the correlation that exists between age at first molar eruption and brain size in the order Primates. We review these questions using what is known about brain growth and maturation, dental development and life history pattern, mainly in Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes. It has been assumed that the brain represents the pace-maker of our development. However, we consider that our particular phenotype is the result of a hierarchical genetic program modulated by epigenetic and environmental factors. The particular bauplan of any kind of organisms (e.g. primates) may explain the high correlation observed between different variables of its life history pattern, brain size or dental development. However, the correlation of these variables seems to be less reliable when dealing with low-rank taxonomical categories (i.e., species). We suggest that, while there is likely some relationship between the rate of somatic development and tooth development, our brain size and maturation (and, by extension, those of other species of the genus Homo) have derived towards a particular trajectory, with a unique pattern of prenatal and postnatal time and rate of growth and, particularly, with remarkable slow brain maturation. We suggest that extremely slow brain maturation could be a very recent acquisition of the last H. sapiens populations. Furthermore, our review of the literature suggests caution in drawing conclusions about aspects of the life history of the hominins from the information we can obtain from dental development in fossil specimens.",2.095,553

The other was a polymorphous rule: No single feature was essential for distinguishing the categories, and all the features overlapped between the categories. Pigeons learned the categories with ease and then showed a prototype effect in accord with the degrees of family resemblance for novel stimuli.

Some studies suggest that these factors do not operate in the same way at the upper (ribs 1-5) and lower thorax (ribs 6-10) during postnatal growth, but it is unknown if the ontogenetic thoracic changes are produced by morphological changes of the ribs (intrinsic rib factors) or by external factors related to costal joints (extrinsic rib factors). MATERIAL AND METHODS: To clarify these questions, we applied 3D geometric morphometrics of landmarks and sliding semilandmarks (N = 20/rib) to 280 individual ribs (1-10) of Homo sapiens comprising the entire human ontogeny and growth simulations were carried out. RESULTS: PCA shows that intrinsic rib factors (rib torsion and axial rib curvature) are ontogenetic factors of variability that contribute to configuring the adult thorax shape. Moreover, growth simulations and regression slopes suggest that the upper thorax unit is comprised by ribs 1-7 and the lower unit at least by ribs 8-10. DISCUSSION: These results suggest anatomical constraints for ontogenetic rib variation, since ribs 1-7 (true ribs) are directly linked to the sternum. Moreover, these results are supported by functional anatomy because pulmonary kinematics would influence the upper unit and diaphragmatic kinematics would influence the lower one. Our findings are relevant not only to understanding how changes at individual ribs contribute to the adult thorax morphology, but also to the development and evolution of the modern human rib cage.",2.379,710

We constructed phage-display peptide libraries to select epitope peptides derived from human posterior head 20 (hPH20) and homo sapiens sperm acrosome associated 1 (hSPACA1) using sera collected from infertile women harbouring anti-sperm antibodies. Following five rounds of selection, positive colonies were reconfirmed for reactivity with the immunoinfertile sera. We biopanned and analysed the chemical properties of four epitope peptides, named P82, Sa6, Sa37 and Sa76. Synthetic peptides were made and coupled to either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or ovalbumin. We used the BSA-conjugated peptides to immunise BALB/c mice and examined the effects on fertility in female and male mice. The synthetic peptides generated a sperm-specific antibody response in female and male mice that caused a contraceptive state. The immunocontraceptive effect was reversible and, with the disappearance of peptide-specific antibodies, there was complete restoration of fertility. Vaccinations using P82, Sa6 and Sa76 peptides resulted in no apparent side effects. Thus, it is efficient and practical to identify epitope peptide candidates by phage display.

A recent hypothesis proposed that large numbers of free radicals were produced when, millions of years ago, Anthropoidea lost the ability to produce endogenous ascorbate, increasing the frequency of mutations and accelerating the evolution of higher primates. Recognizing that retroviruses have been active throughout the period of primate evolution, we suggest that an endogenous retrovirus or other retroviral-like element may have been involved in mutating the gene coding for gulonolactone oxidase (GLO), the terminal step in ascorbate synthesis, approximately 45 million years ago. This possibility is supported by the presence of Alu elements (a common primate retroelement) adjacent to the site of a missing segment of the nonfunctional GLO gene. Although Homo sapiens and other higher primates produce other endogenous antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase and uric acid, they do not quench the same radicals as ascorbate and cannot fully compensate for a lack of endogenous ascorbate. As a consequence, a retrovirus may have played a pivotal role in primate and H. sapiens evolution, and the absence of endogenous ascorbate may be continuing to accelerate the rate of H. sapiens and primate evolution.",5.736,288

This made it possible to estimate the rate of genomic rearrangements that occurred per million years (and per megabase).

However, we lack the data on upper limb motions needed to evaluate the biomechanical context of stone tool production. This study seeks to better understand the biomechanics of stone tool-making by investigating upper limb joint kinematics, focusing on the role of the wrist joint, during simple flake production. We test the hypotheses, based on studies of other upper limb activities (e.g., throwing), that upper limb movements will occur in a proximal-to-distal sequence, culminating in rapid wrist flexion just prior to strike. Data were captured from four amateur knappers during simple flake production using a VICON motion analysis system (50 Hz). Results show that subjects utilized a proximal-to-distal joint sequence and disassociated the shoulder joint from the elbow and wrist joints, suggesting a shared strategy employed in other contexts (e.g., throwing) to increase target accuracy. The knapping strategy included moving the wrist into peak extension (subject peak grand mean = 47.3 degrees) at the beginning of the downswing phase, which facilitated rapid wrist flexion and accelerated the hammerstone toward the nodule. This sequence resulted in the production of significantly more mechanical work, and therefore greater strike forces, than would otherwise be produced. Together these results represent a strategy for increasing knapping efficiency in Homo sapiens and point to aspects of skeletal anatomy that might be examined to assess potential knapping ability and efficiency in fossil hominin taxa.",2.379,1654

From diffuse nerve nets in Cnidaria to modular, hierarchical systems in macaque and humans, there is a gradual shift from simple processes involving a limited amount of tasks and modalities to complex functional and behavioral processing integrating different kinds of information from highly specialized tissue. However, studies in a range of species suggest that fundamental similarities, in spatial and topological features as well as in developmental mechanisms for network formation, are retained across evolution. 'Small-world' topology and highly connected regions (hubs) are prevalent across the evolutionary scale, ensuring efficient processing and resilience to internal (e.g. lesions) and external (e.g. environment) changes. Furthermore, in most species, even the establishment of hubs, long-range connections linking distant components, and a modular organization, relies on similar mechanisms. In conclusion, evolutionary divergence leads to greater complexity while following essential developmental constraints.",0,186

IGF2 was investigated for loss of imprinting (LOI) whereas IGF1R was analysed for copy number aberration and mutation. RESULTS: IGF2 was the most highly overexpressed gene of the IGF pathway in GIST. IGF2 expression was also significantly higher than in other STS. IGF2 expression was correlated to the age onset and mutational status of GIST. Indeed, IGF2 expression was significantly higher in the 'adult' group than in the 'paediatric' and 'young adult' groups. Among adult GIST, IGF2 expression was higher in tumours lacking Homo sapiens v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) or alpha-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA) mutations in comparison with mutated cases. A trend for a higher expression of IGF2 in resistant GIST in comparison to responsive GIST was also found. Overexpression of IGF2 was not related to LOI. Conversely, the expression of the IGF1R gene was significantly higher in the paediatric group than in the adult group. No copy number gains or mutations of IGF1R were observed. CONCLUSION: The IGF pathway is deregulated in GIST with distinct patterns according to age onset and mutational status.

Enzymes from the biochemical pathways of M. tuberculosis from the KEGG metabolic pathway database were compared with proteins from the host H. sapiens, by performing a BLASTp search against the non-redundant database restricted to the H. sapiens subset. The e-value threshold cutoff was set to 0.005. Enzymes, which do not show similarity to any of the host proteins, below this threshold, were filtered out as potential drug targets. We have identified six pathways unique to the pathogen M. tuberculosis when compared to the host H. sapiens. Potential drug targets from these pathways could be useful for the discovery of broad spectrum drugs. Potential drug targets were also identified from pathways related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, vitamin and cofactor biosynthetic pathways and nucleotide metabolism. Of the 185 distinct targets identified from these pathways, many are in various stages of progress at the TB Structural Genomics Consortium. However, 67 of our targets are new and can be considered for rational drug design. As a case study, we have built a homology model of one of the potential drug targets MurD ligase using WHAT IF software. The model could be further explored for insilico docking studies with suitable inhibitors. The study was successful in listing out potential drug targets from the M. tuberculosis proteome involved in vital aspects of the pathogen's metabolism, persistence, virulence and cell wall biosynthesis.

We reconstruct the paleohabitats as revealed by multivariate analyses of the mammalian community structures. Pinnacle Point 30 is a carnivore assemblage and Pinnacle Point 13B includes early evidence of a suite of modern human behavior; together they present an opportunity to identify environmental change over time at a localized geographic scale. Further, this is the first such study to include dated Western Cape localities from Marine Isotope Stage 6, a time of environmental pressure that may have marginalized human populations. Results indicate that environmental change in the Western Cape was more complex than generalized C(4) grassland expansions replacing fynbos habitats during glacial lowered sea levels, and thus, resources available to early modern humans in the region may not have been entirely predictable.",3.733,1643

These tali belong to 14 individuals (11 adult and three immature). Although variation among Middle and Late Pleistocene tali tends to be subtle, this study has identified unique morphological characteristics of the SH tali. They are vertically shorter than those of Late Pleistocene Homo sapiens, and show a shorter head and a broader lateral malleolar facet than all of the samples. Moreover, a few shared characters with Neanderthals are consistent with the hypothesis that the SH population and Neanderthals are sister groups. These shared characters are a broad lateral malleolar facet, a trochlear height intermediate between modern humans and Late Pleistocene H. sapiens, and a short middle calcaneal facet. It has been possible to propose sex assignment for the SH tali based on their size. Stature estimates based on these fossils give a mean stature of 174.4 cm for males and 161.9 cm for females, similar to that obtained based on the long bones from this same site.",3.733,986

Determining thyroid volume is important in assessing growth and involution. Volume estimation is also important in stereological studies. Direct measurements of colloid volume and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of the follicular cells may provide important information about thyroid gland function such as hormone storage and secretion, which helps understand the changes at morphological and functional levels. The present study determined the colloid volume using simple stereological principle and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of 4 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and 2 human thyroid glands. In both dolphin and human thyroid glands, the size of the follicles tended to be quite variable. The distribution of large and small follicles within the thyroid gland was also found to be random in both the dolphin and human thyroid gland; however, the size of follicles appeared to decrease as a function of increasing age in the dolphin thyroid gland. The mean colloid volume of the dolphin thyroid gland and human thyroid gland was 1.22x10(5) microm(3) and 7.02x10(5) microm(3) respectively. The dolphin and human subjects had a significant difference in the mean colloid volume. The mean N/C ratio of the dolphin thyroid follicular epithelia and human follicular epithelia was 0.50 and 0.64 respectively. The dolphin and human subjects had a significant difference in the mean N/C ratio. This information contributes to understanding dolphin thyroid physiology and its structural adaptations to meet the physical demands of the aquatic environment, and aids with ultrasonography and corrective therapy in live subjects.",3.234,105

All species performed at comparable levels, solving all problems except the invisible nonadjacent displacements. Visible displacements were easier than invisible, and single were easier than double displacements. In a 2nd experiment, subjects saw the baiting of either 2 adjacent or 2 nonadjacent containers with no displacements. All species selected the empty container more often when the baited containers were nonadjacent than when they were adjacent. It is hypothesized that a response bias and inhibition problem were responsible for the poor performance in nonadjacent displacements.",1.52,366

Similar structures also referred to as Carabelli's trait have been reported in apes and fossil hominins. However, the morphological development and homology of these mesiolingual structures among hominoids are poorly understood. In this study, we employ micro-computed tomography to image the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) and outer enamel surface (OES) of Pan (n = 48) and H. sapiens (n = 52) upper molars. We investigate the developmental origin of mesiolingual features in these taxa and establish the relative contribution of the EDJ and enamel cap to feature expression. Results demonstrate that mesiolingual features of H. sapiens molars develop at the EDJ and are similarly expressed at the OES. Morphological variation at both surfaces in this taxon can satisfactorily be assessed using standards for Carabelli's trait developed by the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (ASUDAS). Relative to H. sapiens, Pan has an even greater degree of correspondence in feature expression between the EDJ and OES. Morphological manifestations in Pan molars are not necessarily limited to the protocone and are best characterized by a lingual cingulum that cannot be captured by the ASUDAS. Cusp-like structures, similar to those seen in marked Carabelli's trait expressions in H. sapiens, were not found in Pan. This study provides a foundation for further analyses on the evolutionary history of mesiolingual dental traits within the hominoid lineage. It also highlights the wealth of morphological data that can be obtained at the EDJ for understanding tooth development and for characterizing tooth crown variation in worn fossil teeth.",3.733,94

These sequences are diverse, sharing little amino acid homology and vary significantly in length, and although the formation of a positively-charged amphiphilic alpha helix within the MTS is considered to be necessary and sufficient to mediate import, such a feature does not explain their diversity, nor how such diversity influences target sequence function, nor how such dissimilar signals interact with a single, evolutionarily conserved import mechanism. An in silico analysis of 296 N-terminal, matrix destined MTSs from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa was undertaken to investigate relationships between MTSs, and/or, relationships between an individual targeting signal sequence and the protein that it imports.

In Morocco, very few studies are specifically dedicated to small fossil vertebrates, and neither taphonomic nor palaeoecological studies have been undertaken on these taxa, particularly in archaeological contexts. The late Pleistocene to middle Holocene succession of El Harhoura 2 cave, situated in the region of Temara, yields an exceptionally rich small vertebrate assemblage. We present the results of a first systematic, taphonomic, and palaeoecological study of the small mammals from Levels 1 to 8 of El Harhoura 2. The absence of bone sorting and polishing, as well as the presence of significant traces of digestion indicate that the small mammal bones were accumulated in the cave by predators and that no water transport occurred. Other traces observed on the surface of bones consist mainly of root marks and black traces (micro-organisms or more probably manganese) which affected the majority of the material. The percentage of fragmentation is very high in all stratigraphic levels, and the post-depositional breakage (geologic and anthropogenic phenomena) obscure the original breakage patterns of bones by predators. According to the ecology of the different species present in the levels of El Harhoura 2, and by taking into account possible biases highlighted by the taphonomic analysis, we reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental evolution in the region. For quantitative reconstructions we used two indices: the Taxonomic Habitat Index (THI) and the Gerbillinae/Murinae ratio. Late Pleistocene accumulations were characterised by a succession of humid (Levels 3, 4a, 6, and 8) and arid (Levels 2?, 5, and 7) periods, with more or less open landscapes, ending in an ultimate humid and wooded period during the middle Holocene (Level 1).

The cytoplasmic parts of the subunits present a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain at the N-terminus and a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain at the C-terminus. PAS domains are conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and are involved in sensing signals and cellular responses. To better understand the functional roles of PAS domains in KCNH channels, the structure of this domain from the human ether-a-go-go channel (hEAG channel) was determined. By comparing it with the structures of the Homo sapiens EAG-related gene (hERG) channel and the Drosophila EAG-like K(+) (dELK) channel and analyzing the structural features of the hEAG channel, it was identified that a hydrophobic patch on the beta-sheet may mediate interaction between the PAS domain and other regions of the channel to regulate its functions.",0.527,602

Experimental heat treatment of South African silcrete, using open fires of the kind used during the Middle Stone Age, shows that the process needed careful management, notwithstanding recent arguments to the contrary. Silcrete blocks fractured when heated on the surface of open fires or on coal beds, but were heated without mishap when buried in sand below a fire. Three silcrete samples, a control, a block heated underground with maximum temperature between 400 and 500  degrees C and a block heated in an open fire with maximum temperature between 700 and 800  degrees C, were analysed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), optical microscopy, and both Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that the volume expansion during the thermally induced alpha- to beta-quartz phase transformation and the volume contraction during cooling play a major role in the heat treatment of silcrete. Rapid heating or cooling through the phase transformation at 573  degrees C will cause fracture of the silcrete. Successful heat treatment requires controlling surface fire temperatures in order to obtain the appropriate underground temperatures to stay below the quartz inversion temperature. Heat treatment of rocks is a transformative technology that requires skilled use of fire. This process involves analogical reasoning, which is an attribute of complex cognition.",3.733,747

Herpes-viridae and Kaposi's sarcoma illustrate the complexity of host-virus relationship. In following the evolutionary steps of simians and hominoids to Homo, it becomes evident that: a) Epstein-Barr virus evolved in Africa and its ancestral viruses are present in cercopithecines and hominoids; b) human herpes-virus-8-related viruses are present in macaques, in S. American primates and in Homo but such isolates from the great apes are missing. Thus interspecies transfer occurred from lower monkeys to Homo but when and at what geographical location? The human retrolentiviruses also jumped species barriers: this occurred recently in Africa, from great apes (chimpanzee and bonobo) to Homo sapiens (except when HIV-2 was transferred to mankind from sooty mangabeys). The matter is further complicated by the long coevolutionary cooperative interactions between herpes- and retrolentiviruses. Of pathological entities suspected to be etiologically affected by such complex viral cooperation, the origin of Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease is singled out for critical analysis.

25791778,Selection played a role in the evolution of the human chin.,['Pampush JD'],Journal of human evolution,2015,"Chins, which are unique to humans, have generated considerable debate concerning their evolutionary origins, yet a consensus has remained elusive. Many have argued that chins are adaptations for chewing stress, speech, or sexual ornamentation. Alternatively, some have suggested that chins are spandrels-byproducts of selection operating elsewhere in the mandible or face. Lastly, chins could be the product of genetic drift. The questions addressed by this study are: [1] whether chins represent an exceptionally derived morphological condition, and [2] if this can be interpreted as the product of natural selection. These questions are important since the chin is one of the features used to define Homo sapiens in the fossil record. Quantitative measures that capture the degree of chin expression were gathered from a sample of 123 primate taxa, and evolutionary rates associated with these measures were reconstructed in the primate phylogeny. The evolutionary rate associated with these measures was reconstructed to be far higher along the Homo tip ( approximately 77 times greater than the primate background rate of evolution) than elsewhere in the primate phylogeny. These results suggest that human symphyseal morphology is exceptionally derived relative to other primates, and selection has been operational in producing the human chin.",3.733,641
25574774,Enzyme dynamics from NMR spectroscopy.,['Palmer AG 3rd'],Accounts of chemical research,2015,"CONSPECTUS: Biological activities of enzymes, including regulation or coordination of mechanistic stages preceding or following the chemical step, may depend upon kinetic or equilibrium changes in protein conformations. Exchange of more open or flexible conformational states with more closed or constrained states can influence inhibition, allosteric regulation, substrate recognition, formation of the Michaelis complex, side reactions, and product release. NMR spectroscopy has long been applied to the study of conformational dynamic processes in enzymes because these phenomena can be characterized over multiple time scales with atomic site resolution. Laboratory-frame spin-relaxation measurements, sensitive to reorientational motions on picosecond-nanosecond time scales, and rotating-frame relaxation-dispersion measurements, sensitive to chemical exchange processes on microsecond-millisecond time scales, provide information on both conformational distributions and kinetics. This Account reviews NMR spin relaxation studies of the enzymes ribonuclease HI from mesophilic (Escherichia coli) and thermophilic (Thermus thermophilus) bacteria, E. coli AlkB, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae triosephosphate isomerase to illustrate the contributions of conformational flexibility and dynamics to diverse steps in enzyme mechanism. Spin relaxation measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the bacterial ribonuclease H enzymes show that the handle region, one of three loop regions that interact with substrates, interconverts between two conformations. Comparison of these conformations with the structure of the complex between Homo sapiens ribonuclease H and a DNA:RNA substrate suggests that the more closed state is inhibitory to binding. The large population of the closed conformation in T. thermophilus ribonuclease H contributes to the increased Michaelis constant compared with the E. coli enzyme. NMR spin relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy have characterized a conformational transition in AlkB between an open state, in which the side chains of methionine residues in the active site are disordered, and a closed state, in which these residues are ordered. The open state is highly populated in the AlkB/Zn(II) complex, and the closed state is highly populated in the AlkB/Zn(II)/2OG/substrate complex, in which 2OG is the 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate and the substrate is a methylated DNA oligonucleotide. The equilibrium is shifted to approximately equal populations of the two conformations in the AlkB/Zn(II)/2OG complex. The conformational shift induced by 2OG ensures that 2OG binds to AlkB/Zn(II) prior to the substrate. In addition, the opening rate of the closed conformation limits premature release of substrate, preventing generation of toxic side products by reaction with water. Closure of active site loop 6 in triosephosphate isomerase is critical for forming the Michaelis complex, but reopening of the loop after the reaction is (partially) rate limiting. NMR spin relaxation and MD simulations of triosephosphate isomerase in complex with glycerol 3-phosphate demonstrate that closure of loop 6 is a highly correlated rigid-body motion. The MD simulations also indicate that motions of Gly173 in the most flexible region of loop 6 contribute to opening of the active site loop for product release. Considered together, these three enzyme systems illustrate the power of NMR spin relaxation investigations in providing global insights into the role of conformational dynamic processes in the mechanisms of enzymes from initial activation to final product release.",22.323,825

These include the human BLM gene, whose mutation results in Bloom syndrome, and the human WRN gene, whose mutation leads to Werner syndrome resembling premature aging. We cloned a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the RECQ helicase family, Dmblm (Drosophila melanogaster Bloom), which encodes a putative 1487-amino-acid protein. Phylogenetic and dot plot analyses for the RECQ family, including 10 eukaryotic and 3 prokaryotic genes, indicate Dmblm is most closely related to the Homo sapiens BLM gene, suggesting functional similarity. Also, we found that Dmblm cDNA partially rescued the sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae sgs1 mutant, demonstrating the presence of a functional similarity between Dmblm and SGS1. Our analyses identify four possible subfamilies in the RECQ family: (1) the BLM subgroup (H. sapiens Bloom, D. melanogaster Dmblm, and Caenorhabditis elegans T04A11.6); (2) the yeast RECQ subgroup (S. cerevisiae SGS1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe rqh1/rad12); (3) the RECQL/Q1 subgroup (H. sapiens RECQL/Q1 and C. elegans K02F3.1); and (4) the WRN subgroup (H. sapiens Werner and C. elegans F18C5.2).

27368620,How can we detect when language emerged?,['Tattersall I'],Psychonomic bulletin & review,2016,"Views differ radically as to how deep the roots of language lie in human phylogeny, largely because prior to the development of writing systems, this striking human attribute has to be inferred from indirect proxies preserved in the material record. Here I argue that the most appropriate such archaeological proxies encode the modern human symbolic cognitive system from which language emerges. Throughout the 2.5 million years or more for which an archaeological record has existed, change has been both sporadic and rare-until symbolic objects and behaviors begin to appear, well within the tenure of our highly apomorphic species Homo sapiens. I propose that the biology underwriting our unusual cognitive and linguistic systems was acquired in the major developmental reorganization that gave rise to our anatomically distinctive species around 200,000 years ago in Africa. However, the material record indicates that this new potential lay fallow for around 100,000 years, following which it was released by what was necessarily a behavioral stimulus. By far the best candidate for that stimulus is the spontaneous invention of language, which is plausibly underwritten by a relatively simple mental algorithm, and could readily have spurred symbolic cognitive processes in a feedback process. None of this means that earlier hominid vocal communication systems were not complex, or that extinct hominid species were not highly intelligent. But it does emphasize the qualitative distinctiveness of both modern symbolic cognition and language.",3.369,232

Analysis of variance (ANOVA), exponential, Weibull, and power models were fit to the data to determine which best described the relationship between age and neurogenesis. Exponential models provided a suitable fit and were used to estimate the relevant parameters. The rate of decrease of neurogenesis correlated with species longevity (r = 0.769, p = 0.043), but not body mass or basal metabolic rate.

When SK 847 and Stw 53 were treated as separate OTUs, the majority of most parsimonious trees indicated that they were positioned in similar positions as the combined South African Homo OTU; that is, as separate branches between H. rudolfensis and [H. habilis+(H. erectus+H. sapiens)], with the Swartkrans OTU generally occupying a more derived position. The position of the Sterkfontein OTU was more stable than that of the Swartkrans OTU, which was found in several other positions among the minimum length trees. Running the analyses with only those characters preserved by SK 847 and Stw 53 resulted in similar topologies for minimum length trees, although the positions of Stw 53, SK 847, and H. habilis exchanged places in some trees. In no case was an exclusive sister relationship between either South African OTU and a particular species of Homo supported statistically. Both South African OTUs differ from H. habilis in the fewest number of cladistic characters.",3.733,1383
21716742,Before the Emergence of Homo sapiens: Overview on the Early-to-Middle Pleistocene Fossil Record (with a Proposal about Homo heidelbergensis at the subspecific level).,['Manzi G'],International journal of evolutionary biology,2011,"The origin of H. sapiens has deep roots, which include two crucial nodes: (1) the emergence and diffusion of the last common ancestor of later Homo (in the Early Pleistocene) and (2) the tempo and mode of the appearance of distinct evolutionary lineages (in the Middle Pleistocene). The window between 1,000 and 500 thousand years before present appears of crucial importance, including the generation of a new and more encephalised kind of humanity, referred to by many authors as H. heidelbergensis. This species greatly diversified during the Middle Pleistocene up to the formation of new variants (i.e., incipient species) that, eventually, led to the allopatric speciation of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. The special case furnished by the calvarium found near Ceprano (Italy), dated to 430-385 ka, offers the opportunity to investigate this matter from an original perspective. It is proposed to separate the hypodigm of a single, widespread, and polymorphic human taxon of the Middle Pleistocene into distinct subspecies (i.e., incipient species).

21871111,The plausible reason why the length of 5' untranslated region is unrelated to organismal complexity.,"['Chen CH', 'Lin HY', 'Pan CL', 'Chen FC']",BMC research notes,2011,"BACKGROUND: Organismal complexity is suggested to increase with the complexity of transcriptional and translational regulations. Supporting this notion is a recent study that demonstrated a higher level of tissue-specific gene expression in human than in mouse. However, whether this correlation can be extended beyond mammals remains unclear. In addition, 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs), which have undergone stochastic elongation during evolution and potentially included an increased number of regulatory elements, may have played an important role in the emergence of organismal complexity. Although the lack of correlation between 5'UTR length and organismal complexity has been proposed, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. RESULTS: In this study, we select the number of cell types as the measurement of organismal complexity and examine the correlation between (1) organismal complexity and transcriptional regulatory complexity; and (2) organismal complexity and 5'UTR length by comparing the 5'UTRs and multiple-tissue expression profiles of human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The transcriptional regulatory complexity is measured by using the tissue specificity of gene expression and the ratio of non-constitutively expressed to constitutively expressed genes. We demonstrate that, whereas correlation (1) holds well in the three-way comparison, correlation (2) is not true. Results from a larger dataset that includes more than 15 species, ranging from yeast to human, also reject correlation (2). The reason for the failure of correlation (2) may be ascribed to: Firstly, longer 5'UTRs do not contribute to increased tissue specificity of gene expression. Secondly, the increased numbers of common translational regulatory elements in longer 5'UTRs do not lead to increased organismal complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has extended the evidence base for the correlation between organismal complexity and transcriptional regulatory complexity from mammals to fruit fly, the representative model organism of invertebrates. Furthermore, our results suggest that the elongation of 5'UTRs alone can not lead to the increase in regulatory complexity or the emergence of organismal complexity.",0,1513

Yet, a correlation between the cochlea and the spiral forms in nature and art has been very rarely mentioned. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the cochlea and the other spiral objects in nature, as well as the artistic presentation of the spiral forms. METHODS: We explored data related to many natural objects and examined 13,625 artworks created by 2049 artists. We also dissected 2 human cochleas and prepared histologic slices of a rat cochlea. RESULTS: The cochlea is a spiral, cone-shaped osseous structure that resembles certain other spiral forms in nature. It was noticed that parts of some plants are arranged in a spiral manner, often according to Fibonacci numbers. Certain animals, their parts, or their products also represent various types of spirals. Many of them, including the cochlea, belong to the logarithmic type. Nature created spiral forms in the living world to pack a larger number of structures in a limited space and also to improve their function. Because the cochlea and other spiral forms have a certain aesthetic value, many artists presented them in their works of art. CONCLUSIONS: There is a mathematical and geometric correlation between the cochlea and natural spiral objects, and the same functional reason for their formation. The artists' imagery added a new aspect to those domains. Obviously, the creativity of nature and Homo sapiens has no limits--like the infinite distal part of the spiral.",0.984,1399

Probably the first ecological catastrophe happened 3.1-2.5 billion years ago, when photosynthetic cyanophytes poisoned the originally anoxic oceans and atmosphere by oxygen and made most of the environment uninhabitable for competing anaerobous organisms. Now, humans predominate in the biosphere. We do not need to poisson any predators or concurrents. Homo sapiens sapiens should give up the archaic bacterial behaviour and should treat the neighbourhood more respectfully. The area of nature relatively untouched by people is getting smaller each year. The wilderness is more and more fragile to catastrophes, when its area decreases.

The pore loop region of Kv1.1 exhibits similar folds as that of KcsA. The structural feature of the selectivity filter of Kv1.1 is nearly identical to that of KcsA, whereas most of the structural variations occur in the turret as well as in the inner and outer helices. Molecular docking experiments of the scorpion toxin Tc1 from Tityus cambridgei to the outer vestibule of KcsA as well as Kv1.1 were subsequently performed with various initial Tc1 orientations. Tc1 was found to form the most stable complexes with these two K+ channels when the side chain of Lys14 occupies the pore of the selectivity filter through electrostatic interaction. Tc1 binds preferentially towards Kv1.1 than KcsA due to stronger hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions formed between the toxin and the selectivity filter and outer vestibule of Kv1.1. Furthermore, surface complementarity of the outer vestibules of the channels to the Tc1 spatial conformations also plays an important role in stabilizing both the Tc1/KcsA and Tc1/Kv1.1 complexes.",2.919,362

Sequence analysis indicated that the cDNA was of 1965 bp, which had an open reading frame of 1617 bp and encoded a protein containing 539 amino-acids with a mol wt of 57.9 kDa. A BLASTp search against non-redundant (nr) protein sequence showed that C. asiatica HMGR (CaHMGR) has 65-81% identity with HMGRs from different plant species and multi-alignment comparison analysis showed the presence of two motif each corresponding to HMG-CoA-binding and NADP(H)-binding. The Conserved Domain Database analysis predicted that CaHMGR belongs to Class I hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Three-dimensional modeling confirmed the novelty of CaHMGR with a spatial structure similar to Homo sapiens (PDB id: 1IDQ8_A).

METHODS: From pcDNA3.1-NELL1, NELL1 gene sequence was obtained, then NELL1 gene was subcloned into pShuttle-GFP-CMV (-)TEMP vector which was subsequently digested with enzyme and inserted into pAdxsi vector to package the recombinant adenovirus vector (pAdxsi-GFP-NELL1). After verified by enzyme cutting and gel electrophoresis, pAdxsi-GFP-NELL1 was amplified in HEK293 cells and purified by CsCl2 gradient purification, titrated using 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay. The rat BMSCs were cultured and identified by flow cytometry and directional induction, then were infected with adenoviruses (pAdxsi-GFP-NELL1 and pAdxsi-GFP). NELL1 expression was verified by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence; GFP gene expression was verified by the intensity of green fluorescence under fluorescence microscope. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used for investigate the influence of vectors on the proliferation of rat BMSCs. RESULTS: Recombinant adenoviral vector pAdxsi-GFP-NELL1, which encodes a fusion protein of human NELL1, was successfully constructed and amplified with titer of 1 x 10(11) pfu/mL. The primary BMSCs were cultured and identified by flow cytometric analysis, osteogenic and adipogenic induction, then were used for adenoviral transfection efficiency and cell toxicity tests. An multiplicity of infection of 200 pfu/cell produced optimal effects in transfer efficiency without excessive cell death in vitro. Three days after transfection with 200 pfu/cell pAdxsi-GFP-NELL1 or pAdxsi-GFP, over 60% BMSCs showed green fluorescent by fluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence with NELL1 antibody also revealed high level expression of human NELL1 protein in red fluorescent in these GFP expressing cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the exogenous expression of NELL1 upon transfection with pAdxsi-GFP-NELL1 at 200 pfu/cell, whereas NELL1 remained undetectable in Ad-GFP-transfected rat BMSCs.

We provide new data on these important fossils and re-examine some previous suggestions of derived Neandertal features in the middle ear ossicles based on more limited evidence. The malleus shows a curved lateral margin of the manubrium and a relatively large head. The incus shows a tall articular facet, a depressed area on the medial surface of the body, a straight anterior border of the long process and a more closed angle between the processes. The stapes shows an asymmetrical configuration of the crura, with an anteriorly skewed head, and generally small dimensions, including a smaller and relatively wider stapedial footplate. These same features can also be seen in the few other Neandertal ear ossicles known, suggesting that a consistent anatomical pattern characterizes the Neandertal ossicular chain. While the phylogenetic polarity of many of these features remains to be clarified, the asymmetrical stapes and anteriorly skewed stapedial head appear to be derived Neandertal features. In addition, while the larger malleus head and incus articular facet in La Ferrassie 3 might reflect larger body mass in Neandertals, the larger stapes footplates in Homo sapiens cannot be explained by changes in body mass. Indeed, H. sapiens seems to depart from the general mammalian pattern in combining an increase in stapes footplate size with a decrease in body mass. Although the malleus/incus lever ratio in La Ferrassie 3 is similar to that in H. sapiens, Neandertals appear to be characterized by a slightly different spatial relationship and articulation of the ossicular chain within the tympanic cavity. While only limited inferences can be drawn regarding hearing ability based on the ossicles, the few physiologically relevant dimensions in the La Ferrassie 3 ear bones are similar to H. sapiens.",3.733,831

Gamboge is a natural anti-cancer medicine whose pharmacological effects are different from those of conventional chemotherapeutical drugs and they can kill some kinds of cancer cells selectively. In this study, we identified a new gamboge derivative, Compound 2 (C2), which presents eminent suppression effects on cancer cells. Interestingly, when compared with cisplatin (CDDP), C2 effectively suppresses the growth of both cancer stem-like cells and non-cancer stem-like cells derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), inhibiting the formation of tumour spheres and colony in vitro, resulting in the loss of expression of multiple cancer stem cell (CSC)-related molecules in HNSCC. Treating with C2 effectively inhibited the growth of HNSCC in BALB/C nude mice. Further investigation found that C2 notably inhibits the activation of epithelial growth factor receptor and the phosphorylation of its downstream protein kinase homo sapiens v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) in HNSCC, resulting in down-regulation of multiple CSC-related molecules in HNSCC.

The femur is not attributable to Australopithecus, Paranthropus, or early Homo (i.e., H. habilis sensu lato). Homo erectus femora have a relatively longer and AP flatter neck, and a shaft that exhibits less pilaster than the Berg Aukas specimen. Berg Aukas also differs from early modern femora in several features, including diaphyseal cortical thickness and the degree of subtrochanteric AP flattening. The massive diaphyseal cortex of Berg Aukas finds its closest similarity within archaic H. sapiens (e.g., Castel di Guido) and H. erectus (e.g., KNM-ER 736) samples. It has more cortical bone at midshaft than any other specimen, although relative cortical thickness and the asymmetry of its cross-sectional disposition at this level are comparable with those of other Pleistocene femora. The closest morphological comparisons with Berg Aukas are in archaic (i.e., Middle Pleistocene) H. sapiens and Neandertal samples.",2.379,1502

It has been cloned from several species: Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Homo Sapiens and Gallus gallus, but not from Anser anser. This study was conducted to isolate the SCD1 cDNA sequence and investigate the effect of overfeeding on SCD1 gene tissue expression in Landes goose. The complete cDNA is 3294 bp in length, with an ORF of 1.083 bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of 360 amino acids and 5'/3'-UTR of 74 and 2137 bp, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was used to examine SCD1 expression in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, gizzard, glandular stomach, intestine, crureus, pectoral muscle, hypothalamus and adipose tissue (abdominal fat) in both the overfed and control group. SCD1 mRNA was highly expressed in goose fatty liver, and the expression levels of SCD1 in liver and fat of overfeeding group were more than double that of the control group. During the overfeeding period, SCD1 expression in liver and adipose tissue reached the highest level after 70 days, but declined at 79 days. In the control group, after fasting 24h, the expression level of SCD1 gene in tissues declined sharply. However, SCD1 gene expression in hypothalamus was unaffected. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis to study the relationship between SCD1 gene expression and the formation of fatty liver of Landes goose in response to overfeeding.",2.138,1194

However, the credibility of these scenarios might have been compromised by a largely inaccurate and compressed chronological framework previously established for hominin fossils found in China. Recently there has been a growing body of evidence indicating the possible presence of AMH in eastern Asia ca. 100 ka ago or even earlier. Here we report high-precision mass spectrometric U-series dating of intercalated flowstone samples from Huanglong Cave, a recently discovered Late Pleistocene hominin site in northern Hubei Province, central China. Systematic excavations there have led to the in situ discovery of seven hominin teeth and dozens of stone and bone artifacts. The U-series dates on localized thin flowstone formations bracket the hominin specimens between 81 and 101 ka, currently the most narrow time span for all AMH beyond 45 ka in China, if the assignment of the hominin teeth to modern Homo sapiens holds. Alternatively this study provides further evidence for the early presence of an AMH morphology in China, through either independent evolution of local archaic populations or their assimilation with incoming AMH. Along with recent dating results for hominin samples from Homo erectus to AMH, a new extended and continuous timeline for Chinese hominin fossils is taking shape, which warrants a reconstruction of human evolution, especially the origins of modern humans in eastern Asia.",3.733,920

We hypothesize that two key events shaped the early history of the Beijing genotype: (1) its Upper Palaeolithic origin in the Homo sapiens sapiens K-M9 cluster in Central Asia, and (2) primary Neolithic dispersal of the secondary Beijing NTF::IS6110 lineage by Proto-Sino-Tibetan farmers within east Asia (human O-M214/M122 haplogroup).

We report the crystal structure of the dimeric enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei in complex with the product glutathione. The enzyme belongs to the ATP-grasp family, a group of enzymes known to undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding. The T. brucei enzyme crystal structure presents two dimers in the asymmetric unit. The structure reveals variability in the order and position of a small domain, which forms a lid for the active site and serves to capture conformations likely to exist during the catalytic cycle. Comparisons with orthologous enzymes, in particular from Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisae, indicate a high degree of sequence and structure conservation in part of the active site. Structural differences that are observed between the orthologous enzymes are assigned to different ligand binding states since key residues are conserved. This suggests that the molecular determinants of ligand recognition and reactivity are highly conserved across species. We conclude that it would be difficult to target the parasite enzyme in preference to the host enzyme and therefore glutathione synthetase may not be a suitable target for antiparasitic drug discovery.",1.787,1777

However, which acoustic features promote decoding of emotional state and how the decoding is affected by their listener's psychology remain poorly understood. Here we tested how acoustic features of piglet vocalizations interact with psychological profiles of human listeners to affect judgments of emotional content of heterospecific vocalizations. We played back 48 piglet call sequences recorded in four different contexts (castration, isolation, reunion, nursing) to 60 listeners. Listeners judged the emotional intensity and valence of the recordings and were further asked to attribute a context of emission from four proposed contexts. Furthermore, listeners completed a series of questionnaires assessing their personality (NEO-FFI personality inventory), empathy [Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)] and attitudes to animals (Animal Attitudes Scale). None of the listeners' psychological traits affected the judgments. On the contrary, acoustic properties of recordings had a substantial effect on ratings. Recordings were rated as more intense with increasing pitch (mean fundamental frequency) and increasing proportion of vocalized sound within each stimulus recording and more negative with increasing pitch and increasing duration of the calls within the recording. More complex acoustic properties (jitter, harmonic-to-noise ratio, and presence of subharmonics) did not seem to affect the judgments. The probability of correct context recognition correlated positively with the assessed emotion intensity for castration and reunion calls, and negatively for nursing calls. In conclusion, listeners judged emotions from pig calls using simple acoustic properties and the perceived emotional intensity might guide the identification of the context.",1.52,53

With the rapid accumulation of muscle microarray data, it is of great interest to understand how to compare and combine data across multiple studies. Meta-analysis of transcriptome data is a valuable method to achieve it. It enables to highlight conserved gene signatures between multiple independent studies. However, using it is made difficult by the diversity of the available data: different microarray platforms, different gene nomenclature, different species studied, etc. DESCRIPTION: We have developed a system tool dedicated to muscle transcriptome data. This system comprises a collection of microarray data as well as a query tool. This latter allows the user to extract similar clusters of co-expressed genes from the database, using an input gene list. Common and relevant gene signatures can thus be searched more easily. The dedicated database consists in a large compendium of public data (more than 500 data sets) related to muscle (skeletal and heart). These studies included seven different animal species from invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans) and vertebrates (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris, Gallus gallus). After a renormalization step, clusters of co-expressed genes were identified in each dataset. The lists of co-expressed genes were annotated using a unified re-annotation procedure. These gene lists were compared to find significant overlaps between studies. CONCLUSIONS: Applied to this large compendium of data sets, meta-analyses demonstrated that conserved patterns between species could be identified. Focusing on a specific pathology (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) we validated results across independent studies and revealed robust biomarkers and new pathways of interest. The meta-analyses performed with MADMuscle show the usefulness of this approach. Our method can be applied to all public transcriptome data.",3.986,1558

Here, using Homo sapiens as a model organism, we have analyzed two main folding classes (all-alpha and all-beta) to examine the factors affecting their evolutionary rates. Since, secondary structures are the most fundamental components of the protein folding classes, we explored the effect of protein secondary structure composition on evolution. Our results show that sheet and helix fractions exhibit positive and negative correlations, respectively, with the rate of protein evolution. On dividing the secondary structure components according to solvent accessibility, linear regression model identified two factors namely buried sheet fraction and relative aggregation propensity. Both these factors together can explain about 13.4% variability in the rate of human protein evolution, while buried sheet residues can alone account to 9.9% variability.",1.68,1678

Highly connected genes in the thresholded network are then grouped into modules that provide insight into their collective functionality. While it has been shown that co-expression networks are biologically relevant, it has not been determined to what extent any given network is functionally robust given perturbations in the input sample set. For such a test, hundreds of networks are needed and hence a tool to rapidly construct these networks. To examine functional robustness of networks with varying input, we enhanced an existing RMT implementation for improved scalability and tested functional robustness of human (Homo sapiens), rice (Oryza sativa) and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

Recent advances demonstrated that P. falciparum evolved from ancestors of gorilla parasites via host switching. Here, we estimate the range of dates during which this host switch may have occurred. DNA sequences of portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene obtained from gorilla parasites closely related to human P. falciparum were aligned and compared against similar sequences from human P. falciparum. Time estimates were calculated by applying a previously established parasite cytochrome b gene mutation rate (0.012 mutations per site per million years) and by modeling uncertainty in a Monte-Carlo simulation. We estimate a 95% confidence interval for when P. falciparum first infected ancestors of modern humans to be 112,000 and 1,036,000 years ago (median estimate, 365,000 years ago). This confidence interval suggests that P. falciparum first infected human ancestors much more recently than the previous recognized estimate of 2.5 million years ago. The revised estimate may inform our understanding of certain aspects of human-malaria co-evolution. For example, this revised date suggests a closer relationship between the entry of P. falciparum in humans and the appearance of many red blood cell polymorphisms considered to be genetic adaptations to malaria. In addition, the confidence interval lies within the timeframe dating the dawn of Homo sapiens, suggesting that P. falciparum may have undergone host switching as a Plasmodia adaptation specific for our species.",1.68,1382

To establish the crystal structure of Podocnemis Hb A, we first determined the globin primary structures using cDNA nucleotide sequencing with the assistance of protein sequencing. The purified Podocnemis Hb A produced a different form of crystal for each of the two different buffer systems used: form A, tetragonal crystals (space group, P4(1)2(1)2), produced under neutral pH (pH 7-8) conditions; and form B, hexagonal crystals (space group, P6(1)22), produced under high alkaline pH (pH 11-13) conditions. Single crystals of the two forms were examined by Raman microscopy with an excitation of 532 nm, indicating their structural differences. The crystal structures of the two forms were constructed by X-ray crystallographic diffraction at a resolution of 2.20 A for form A and 2.35 A for form B. The differences of the tertiary and quaternary structures of the two forms were marginal; however, one clear difference was found in helix structure. When comparing Podocnemis Hb A with Hb A from specimens in other taxa, such as Anser indicus (birds) and Homo sapiens (mammals) by SHELXPRO, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the corresponding Calpha atoms of the two globins does not exceed 2.0 A. These low values indicate the crystal structures resemble each other.

Right-hemisphere specialization was found only for screeching. Second, subjective measures were acquired via a human judgment of the emotional intensity of baboons' chimeric faces for the 2 previous emotional behaviors plus a neutral expression. They also addressed the question of hemispheric lateralization for emotions in human judges by using a chimeric task with human faces. The left-composite chimeric faces of baboons and the human chimeric faces were judged to be emotionally stronger than the right ones for the emotional behaviors, and no preference was found for the neutral non emotional category. Human participants, especially those who displayed a left-hemisphere specialization for processing emotions, demonstrated higher ability to distinguish the most emotionally communicative signals in baboons' facial expressions than right-hemispheric dominant participants.

Distal-less or Dll is a highly conserved and well studied transcription factor required for limb formation in invertebrates and vertebrates. We have identified a homologue of this gene, NlDll, and demonstrated that it is expressed in all life stages of N. lugens, particularly in adult brachypterous females. When we compared between specific adult tissues it was expressed most strongly in wings. Using RNAi techniques we demonstrated that downregulation of NlDll in the 3rd instar larvae led to the disrupted development of the leg, while downregulation of NlDll in the 5th instar larvae led to abnormal wing formation. Ectopic over-expression of NlDll in Drosophila melanogaster using the GAL4-UAS system led to fatal or visible phenotypic changes such as the loss of normal wing structure and disrupted haltere structure. Our work suggests that NlDll is a conserved homologue of Distal-less and is required for both leg development and wing structure. Since researches have shown that Dll is required for wing morphogenesis, understanding the role of NlDll during the wing development will further provide a basis for revealing the molecular mechanism of the wing dimorphism in brown planthopper.

Here we present a novel method for quantifying the ellipticalness (i.e., departure from perfectly circular) of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC), applying this technique to hominid femora. Three-dimensional surface models were created for 49 Homo sapiens, 34 Pan troglodytes and 25 Gorilla gorilla femora. Software was developed that fit separate cylinders to each of the femoral condyles. These cylinders were constrained to have a single axis, but could have different radii. The cylinder fit to the LFC was allowed to assume an elliptical cross-section, while the cylinder fit to the medial condyle was constrained to remain circular. The shape of the elliptical cylinder (ratio of the major and minor axes of the ellipse) was recorded, and the orientation of the elliptical cylinder quantified as angles between the major axis of the ellipse and the anatomical and mechanical axes of the femur. Species were compared using analysis of variance and post hoc multiple comparisons tests. Confirming qualitative descriptions, human LFCs are more elliptical than those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Human femora exhibit a narrow range for the angle between the major axis of the elliptical cylinder and femoral axes.

The results showed that there are various forms of MEF2 in human body, and there are some differences in the physicochemical characteristics. Relatively more phosphorylation sites are found and the main glycosylation sites are N-glycosylation sites. All MEF2 proteins of human contain MADS domain, and most contain MEF2 domain and HJURP_C domain.

Analysis of their similarity to ubiquitin indicates that homologous amino acid residues in MUBs form a hydrophobic surface very similar to the recognition patch surrounding Ile-44 in ubiquitin. This suggests that MUBs may interact with proteins containing an alpha-helical motif similar to those of some ubiquitin binding domains. A disordered loop common to MUBs may also provide a second protein interaction site. From the available data, it is probable that this protein is prenylated and associated with the membrane. With <20% identity to ubiquitin, the MUB family further expands the sequence space that maps to the beta-grasp fold, and adds membrane localization to its list of functional roles.",0,479

There is considerable interest among cell biologists to determine genes that are periodic in multiple organisms and whether such genes are also evolutionarily conserved in their relative order of time to peak expression. Interestingly, periodicity is not well-conserved evolutionarily. A conservative estimate of a number of periodic genes common to fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ('core set FB') is 35, while those common to fission yeast and humans (Homo sapiens) ('core set FH') is 24. Using a novel statistical methodology, we discover that the relative order of peak expression is conserved in  approximately 80% of FB genes and in  approximately 40% of FH genes. We also discover that the order is evolutionarily conserved in six genes which are potentially the core set of signature cell cycle genes.

Students were originally provided with the protein sequence of the Xenopus laevis DNMT1 cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase and used BLASTP searches to detect the presence of protein orthologs in the genomes of several organisms including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Students generated hypotheses regarding the presence and abundance of 5-methylcytosine in these organisms based on their bioinformatics data, and directly tested their predictions on a subset of DNAs using restriction enzyme isoschizomer assays.

In addition to exposure to the field of epigenetics, the strengths of the laboratory are students are able to make predictions using bioinformatic tools and quickly test them in the laboratory.

22262672,Construction and completion of flux balance models from pathway databases.,"['Latendresse M', 'Krummenacker M', 'Trupp M', 'Karp PD']","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2012,"MOTIVATION: Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a well-known technique for genome-scale modeling of metabolic flux. Typically, an FBA formulation requires the accurate specification of four sets: biochemical reactions, biomass metabolites, nutrients and secreted metabolites. The development of FBA models can be time consuming and tedious because of the difficulty in assembling completely accurate descriptions of these sets, and in identifying errors in the composition of these sets. For example, the presence of a single non-producible metabolite in the biomass will make the entire model infeasible. Other difficulties in FBA modeling are that model distributions, and predicted fluxes, can be cryptic and difficult to understand. RESULTS: We present a multiple gap-filling method to accelerate the development of FBA models using a new tool, called MetaFlux, based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The method suggests corrections to the sets of reactions, biomass metabolites, nutrients and secretions. The method generates FBA models directly from Pathway/Genome Databases. Thus, FBA models developed in this framework are easily queried and visualized using the Pathway Tools software. Predicted fluxes are more easily comprehended by visualizing them on diagrams of individual metabolic pathways or of metabolic maps. MetaFlux can also remove redundant high-flux loops, solve FBA models once they are generated and model the effects of gene knockouts. MetaFlux has been validated through construction of FBA models for Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens.

The mastoid was large and suggested a powerful sternocleidomastoid muscle. The inner ear and tympanic cavities were similar in size and orientation, suggesting that their functions were probably similar. Our observations suggest that the left ear of this Hh specimen was healthy. The large canaliculo-fenestral angle confirms that this ancestor was bipedal. It also strongly suggests that Hh individuals were predisposed to develop certain pathologies of the labyrinth capsule associated with bipedalism, in particular otosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: We studied a temporal bone of Homo heidelbergensis (Hh) in order to investigate the clinical and physiological implications of certain morphological features, especially those associated with the evolutionary reorganization of the inner ear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The bone, found in a breach of a cave near MAaaga in southern Spain, together with Middle Upper Pleistocene faunal remains, is >300000 years old. Four analytical methods were employed. A 3D high-resolution surface laser scan was used for anatomical measurements. For the sectional analysis of the middle and inner ears of Hh we used high-resolution CT, simultaneously studying a normal temporal bone from Homo sapiens sapiens (Hss). To study the middle and inner ear spaces we used 3D reconstruction CT preceded by an intra-bone air shielding technique. To examine the tympanic cavities and measure the canaliculo fenestral angle, we used a special minimally invasive endoscopic procedure. RESULTS: The surface, sectional and 3D CT examinations showed that the Hh specimen was generally more robust and larger than the Hss specimen. It had a large glenoid fossa. The external meatus was wide and deep. The middle ear, and especially the mastoid, was large and widely pneumatized. There were no appreciable differences in the position and size of the labyrinthine spaces and tympanic cavity. The dimensions of the semicircular canals were similar to those of the Hss specimen. Endoscopy revealed normal, healthy tympanic walls and an ossicle fragment in the atticum that probably belonged to the body of the malleus. The diameters of the fallopian duct and the tympanic opening of the Eustachian tube were large. The canaliculo-fenestral angle was approximately 114 degrees",1.099,1322

Herein, we report a label-free fluorescence detection method for DNA methylation and MTase activity based on restriction endonuclease HpaII and exonuclease III (Exo III). A label-free probe DNA was designed, which hybridized with target DNA (one 32-mer DNA from the exon 8 promoter region of the Homo sapiens p53 gene) to form double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Upon the cleavage action of HpaII and degradation reaction of Exo III, dsDNA changed to single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the fluorescence intensity of thiazole orange (TO) is weak. After the resulting dsDNA was methylated by M.SssI MTase, the action of HpaII and Exo III was prevented, then TO intercalates into the dsDNA and emits strong fluorescence. This method can determine DNA methylation at the site of CpG and distinguish a one-base mismatched target sequence. The fluorescence intensity has a linear relationship with M.SssI MTase activities in the range of 1-10 U mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.16 U mL(-1) in terms of 3 times deviation of the blank sample. The methylation of DNA by a hydroxyl radical triggered by DMSO and CH3CHO was also measured.

Therefore, we have engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to act as a surrogate for expressing anti-parasitic targets from a range of biomedically important pathogens, to facilitate the rapid identification of new therapeutic agents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using pyrimethamine/dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as a model parasite drug/drug target system, we explore the potential of engineered yeast strains (expressing DHFR enzymes from Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, Homo sapiens, Schistosoma mansoni, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi) to exhibit appropriate differential sensitivity to pyrimethamine. Here, we demonstrate that yeast strains (lacking the major drug efflux pump, Pdr5p) expressing yeast ((Sc)DFR1), human ((Hs)DHFR), Schistosoma ((Sm)DHFR), and Trypanosoma ((Tb)DHFR and (Tc)DHFR) DHFRs are insensitive to pyrimethamine treatment, whereas yeast strains producing Plasmodium ((Pf)DHFR and (Pv)DHFR) DHFRs are hypersensitive. Reassuringly, yeast strains expressing field-verified, drug-resistant mutants of P. falciparum DHFR ((Pf)dhfr(51I,59R,108N)) are completely insensitive to pyrimethamine, further validating our approach to drug screening. We further show the versatility of the approach by replacing yeast essential genes with other potential drug targets, namely phosphoglycerate kinases (PGKs) and N-myristoyl transferases (NMTs). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have generated a number of yeast strains that can be successfully harnessed for the rapid and selective identification of urgently needed anti-parasitic agents.",4.446,1454

To understand the overall landscape of their functional diversity, it is important to establish a computational method that can identify MPs on a genome scale. Previously, we have systematically characterized MPs using functional and omics-scale information. In this work, we develop a computational prediction model for automatic identification of MPs using a diverse range of protein association information. RESULTS: We incorporated a diverse range of protein association information to extract characteristic features of MPs, which range from gene ontology (GO), protein-protein interactions, gene expression, phylogenetic profiles, genetic interactions and network-based graph properties to protein structural properties, i.e. intrinsically disordered regions in the protein chain. Then, we used machine learning classifiers using the broad feature space for predicting MPs. Because many known MPs lack some proteomic features, we developed an imputation technique to fill such missing features. Results on the control dataset show that MPs can be predicted with over 98% accuracy when GO terms are available. Furthermore, using only the omics-based features the method can still identify MPs with over 75% accuracy. Last, we applied the method on three genomes: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens, and found that about 2-10% of proteins in the genomes are potential MPs.

TLR5 is responsible for the recognition of bacterial flagellin in vertebrates. In this study, we cloned the goose TLR5 gene using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The open reading frame (ORF) of goose TLR5 cDNA is 2583 bp in length and encodes an 860 amino acid protein. The entire coding region of the TLR5 gene was successfully amplified from genomic DNA and contained a single exon. The putative amino acid sequence of goose TLR5 consisted of a signal peptide sequence, 11 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal (LRR-CT) domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The amino acid sequence of goose TLR5 shared 50.5% identity with human (Homo sapiens), 49.8% with mouse (Mus musculus) and 82.7% with chicken (Gallus gallus). The goose TLR5 gene was highly expressed in the spleen, liver and brain; moderately expressed in PBMCs, kidney, lung, heart, bone marrow, small intestine and large intestine; and minimally expressed in the cecum. HEK293 cells transfected with goose TLR5 and NF-kappaB-luciferase containing plasmids significantly responded to flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium indicating that it is a functional TLR5 homologue. In response to infection with S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE), the level of TLR5 mRNA significantly increased over the control in PBMCs at 1 d post infection (p.i.) and was slightly elevated in the spleen at 1 d or 3 d p.i.

RPS4Y is an expressed gene that maps to the non-recombining region of the Y chromosome.

U.S.A. 88:7401-7404) and the Y-linked ZFY locus (Dorit et al. [1995] Science 268:1183-1185). A combined data set derived from three distinct Y-linked loci-RPS4Y, SRY, and ZFY-was also analyzed. The maximum parsimony topology for the combined data provided only weak support for a shared common ancestor for Homo and Pan subsequent to divergence from the Gorilla lineage. Taken together, the data from the Y chromosome do not provide unequivocal support for any single, dichotomously branching species tree linking Homo, Pan, and Gorilla.",2.379,1774

We have evaluated the dimerization specificity of the seven coiled-coil B-ZIP proteins (ATF6, XBP, LZIP, NFIL3, TEF, CREB, and C/EBPalpha) with themselves and each other. To do this, we designed dominant negative proteins, termed A-ZIPs, that contain the leucine zipper dimerization domain of a B-ZIP protein and an acidic amphipathic N-terminal extension. The A-ZIPs heterodimerize with B-ZIP proteins in a leucine zipper-dependent manner. The acidic N-terminal extension is hypothesized to form an heterodimeric coiled-coil structure with the basic region, essentially zippering the leucine zipper into the basic region. We now present a new acidic extension design that stabilizes heterodimerization with B-ZIP proteins up to 11 kcal mol(-1). We have used these A-ZIP proteins in a competition EMSA to evaluate which A-ZIP can prevent DNA binding of which B-ZIP domain. Inhibition of DNA binding is interpreted to indicate that the A-ZIP is forming a heterodimer with the B-ZIP domain and thus prevents the B-ZIP from binding to DNA. All leucine zippers examined can homodimerize and two pairs (CREB & NFIL3 and ATF6 & XBP) can heterodimerize. We discuss these results with reference to the amino acid sequence of the leucine zipper region. These A-ZIP reagents may be of value in biological systems to inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional potential of specific B-ZIP families.",3.231,524

 Forschung am Menschen",2003,"After 30 years of selection, breeding of the pig breed sus scrofa Pietrain has resulted in reduced backfat thickness (from 3.2 to 1.9 mm) and increased loin muscle area (40 to 60 cm2) which indicates high genetic determination of these body composition traits. The use of sophisticated quantitative genetic methods that include all genetic relationships of large populations has led to a high response to selection of these traits. Selection on feed intake, lean and fat tissue growth using nonlinear functions to optimise these traits during the entire growth period in a biological model offers the opportunity to further improve total genetic potential. Protein and lipid deposition rates during the entire growth period have to be known for this biological model to be applied; thus knowledge of the genetic background of these traits is of high economic value. With the use of molecular genetic methods, such as candidate gene and genome scan approaches, the identification of genes for obesity and growth can be obtained. In sus scrofa, candidate genes associated with obesity and growth include Leptin Receptor, Melanocortin-4 Receptor, Agouti related protein, Heart fatty acid binding protein 3, and Insulin-like growth factor 2. Some of these candidate genes also explain variation in obesity levels in humans. Initial genome-wide scans have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 7 and X for obesity and on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 8, 13 and 18 for growth.

We have used a number of approaches to probe the evolutionary history of these genes and show that SMN gene duplication and the appearance of SMN2 occurred at very distinct evolutionary times. Molecular fossil and molecular clock data suggest that this duplication may have occurred as recently as 3 million years ago in that the position and identity repetitive elements are identical for both human SMN genes and overall sequence divergence ranged from 0.15% to 0.34%. However, these approaches ignore the possibility of sequence homogenization by means of gene conversion. Consequently, we have used quantitative polymerase chain rection and analysis of allelic variants to provide physical evidence for or against SMN gene duplication in the chimpanzee, mankind's closest relative. These studies have revealed that chimpanzees have 2-7 copies of the SMN gene per diploid genome; however, the two nucleotides diagnostic for exons 7-8 and the SMNdelta7 mRNA product of the SMN2 gene are absent in non-human primates. In contrast, the SMN2 gene has been detected in all extant human populations studied to date, including representatives from Europe, the Central African Republic, and the Congo. These data provide conclusive evidence that SMN gene duplication occurred more than 5 million years ago, before the separation of human and chimpanzee lineages, but that SMN2 appears for the first time in Homo sapiens.",4.824,367

METHODS: Our sample included 164 specimens: 57 recent H. sapiens, 44 Upper Paleolithic H. sapiens, 17 early H. sapiens, and 46 Neandertals. Of these, 59 represent dm2/M1 pairs from the same individuals. Occlusal photographs were used to obtain crown shapes of dm2s and M1s. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the matrix of shape coordinates was used to explore the pattern of morphological variation across the dm2 and M1 samples. Allometry was investigated by means of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Two-block partial least squares (2B-PLS) analysis was used to explore patterns of covariation between dm2 and M1 crown outlines of matched individual pairs. RESULTS: The PCA confirmed significant differences between Neandertal and H. sapiens dm2 and M1 shapes. Allometry accounted for a small but statistically significant proportion of the total morphological variance. The magnitude of the allometric contribution to crown shape was stronger among Neandertals than among H. sapiens. However, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the two species share the same allometric trajectory. The 2B-PLS analysis of the pooled sample of paired individuals revealed a significant correlation in crown shape between dm2 and M1. While Procrustes distances differed significantly between dm2 and M1 in Neandertals, it did not among H. sapiens groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm several of the results obtained by a similar study of upper dm2/M1 (dm(2)/M(1)), but there are differences as well. Neandertal dm2/M1 shapes are less derived than those of the dm(2)/M(1). Such differences may support previous studies, which have suggested that different developmental and/or epigenetic factors affect the upper and lower dentitions.",2.379,167

While there is evidence that the human capacity for culture has a deeper history, going beyond the origin of the hominin clade, the tendency for humans to form cultures as part of being distinct communities and populations changed markedly with the evolution of H. sapiens. In this paper, we investigate 'cultures' as opposed to 'culture', and the question of how and why, compared to biological diversity, human communities and populations are so culturally diverse. We consider the way in which the diversity of human cultures has developed since 100,000 years ago, and how its rate was subject to environmental factors. We argue that the causes of this diversity lie in the distribution of resources and the way in which human communities reproduce over several generations, leading to fissioning of kin groups.

There may be a genetic influence on lateral cradling tendencies; women's left-side cradling preferences were found to be repeated with subsequent children. Heritability of women's LCF has an upper limit of 0.82, and the regression of daughters' mean LCF on mothers' LCF gives a heritability of 0.93 +/- 0.29.

The fossils and stone tools that record the spatial distribution of our species in the past form the backbone of our evolutionary history, and one that allows us to explore the different processes-cultural and biological-that acted to shape the evolution of different populations in the face of major climate change. Those processes created a complex palimpsest of similarities and differences, with outcomes that were at times accelerated by sharp demographic and geographical fluctuations. The result is that the population ancestral to all modern humans did not look or behave like people alive today. This has generated questions regarding the evolution of human universal characters, as well as the nature and timing of major evolutionary events in the history of Homo sapiens The paucity of African fossils remains a serious stumbling block for exploring some of these issues. However, fossil and archaeological discoveries increasingly clarify important aspects of our past, while breakthroughs from genomics and palaeogenomics have revealed aspects of the demography of Late Quaternary Eurasian hominin groups and their interactions, as well as those between foragers and farmers. This paper explores the nature and timing of key moments in the evolution of human diversity, moments in which population collapse followed by differential expansion of groups set the conditions for transitional periods. Five transitions are identified (i) at the origins of the species, 240-200 ka; (ii) at the time of the first major expansions, 130-100 ka; (iii) during a period of dispersals, 70-50 ka; (iv) across a phase of local/regional structuring of diversity, 45-25 ka; and (v) during a phase of significant extinction of hunter-gatherer diversity and expansion of particular groups, such as farmers and later societies (the Holocene Filter), 15-0 ka.This article is part of the themed issue 'Major transitions in human evolution'.",2.147,585

Both male and female H. sapiens experience pubertal growth spurts and are not sexually dimorphic in adult stature. These unique growth characteristics must have evolved to benefit the reproductive success and survival of the species. The H. sapiens childhood is relatively protracted, and the pubertal growth spurt may be a compensatory measure to attain adult size in a relatively short time. Because reproductive patterns of H. sapiens have evolved away from a male-dominated social structure, large male size no longer confers a reproductive advantage. The relatively large female size of H. sapiens might have evolved to support the birth of offspring with ever-increasing cranial characteristics. Growth in H. sapiens depends largely on GH-dependent STAT5b regulation of IGF-I expression. STAT5b in other mammals contributes to growth in males only. Although speculative, the loss of sexual dimorphism in H. sapiens may reflect a progressive dependence on STAT5b to control growth.",3.79,1499

RecQ helicase family members are essential in homologous recombination-based error-free DNA repair processes in all domains of life. RecQ helicases present in each organism differ and several homologues have been identified in various multicellular organisms. These proteins are involved in various pathways of DNA metabolism by providing duplex unwinding function. Five members of RecQ family are present in Homo sapiens but P. falciparum contains only two members of this family. Here we report the detailed biochemical and functional characterization of the Bloom (Blm) homologue (PfBlm) from P. falciparum 3D7 strain. Purified PfBlm exhibits ATPase and 3' to 5' direction specific DNA helicase activity. The calculated average reaction rate of ATPase was ~13 pmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/pmol of enzyme. The immunofluorescence assay results show that PfBlm is expressed in all the stages of intraerythrocytic development of the P. falciparum 3D7 strain. In some stages of development in addition to nucleus PfBlm also localizes in the cytoplasm. The gene disruption studies of PfBlm by dsRNA showed that it is required for the ex-vivo intraerythrocytic development of the parasite P. falciparum 3D7 strain. The dsRNA mediated inhibition of parasite growth suggests that a variety of pathways are affected resulting in curtailing of the parasite growth.

This circular approach has led to considerable debate about the human-like and ape-like affinities of fossil hominins. Teeth are invaluable for understanding maturation as age at death can be directly assessed from dental microstructure, and dental development has been shown to correlate with life history across primates broadly. We employ non-destructive synchrotron imaging to characterize incremental development, molar emergence, and age at death in more than 20 Australopithecus anamensis, Australopithecus africanus, Paranthropus robustus and South African early Homo juveniles. Long-period line periodicities range from at least 6-12 days (possibly 5-13 days), and do not support the hypothesis that australopiths have lower mean values than extant or fossil Homo. Crown formation times of australopith and early Homo postcanine teeth fall below or at the low end of extant human values; Paranthropus robustus dentitions have the shortest formation times. Pliocene and early Pleistocene hominins show remarkable variation, and previous reports of age at death that employ a narrow range of estimated long-period line periodicities, cuspal enamel thicknesses, or initiation ages are likely to be in error. New chronological ages for SK 62 and StW 151 are several months younger than previous histological estimates, while Sts 24 is more than one year older. Extant human standards overestimate age at death in hominins predating Homo sapiens, and should not be applied to other fossil taxa. We urge caution when inferring life history as aspects of dental development in Pliocene and early Pleistocene fossils are distinct from modern humans and African apes, and recent work has challenged the predictive power of primate-wide associations between hominoid first molar emergence and certain life history variables.",3.234,562

Using high accuracy nano LC-MS/MS combined with affinity purification, we identified a total of 636 lysine-acetylated sites in 353 proteins and 605 lysine-succinylated sites in 262 proteins. These proteins participated in many biology processes, with various molecular functions. In particular, 119 proteins and 115 sites were found to be both acetylated and succinylated, simultaneously.

Among the 262 succinylated proteins, 170 of them were found to have homologous proteins in Oryza sativa L., Escherichia coli, Sacchayromyces cerevisiae, or Homo sapiens. Motif-X analysis of the acetylated and succinylated sites identified two new acetylated motifs (K---K and K-I-K) and twelve significantly enriched succinylated motifs for the first time, which could serve as possible binding loci for future studies in plants.

STUDY DESIGN: The material comprised a total of 360 pelves: 3 fossil pelves reconstructed using casts (Australopithecus afarensis Lucy or AL 288-1, Homo erectus KNM-WT 15000, H. neanderthalensis or Kebara 2), 305 female modern adult pelves and 52 female Catarrhine pelves (29 gorillas, 18 chimpanzees, 5 orang-utans). All these pelves were reconstructed in order to carry out 11 pelvimetric measurements. Each measurement was carried out twice and by two different operators. RESULTS: The pelvis of Lucy was platypelloid at each pelvic plane. The pelvic inlet of H. neanderthalensis was anteroposteriorly oval whereas the midplane and the outlet were transversely oval. The pelvis of H. erectus was globally round. In modern women, the inlet was transversely oval. The pelvic midplane and outlet were anteroposteriorly oval. In the great apes, the shape of all three pelvic planes was anteroposteriorly oval. The discriminating value of the various pelvimetry measurements place Australopithecus Lucy, H. neanderthalensis Kebara 2, and H. erectus KNM-WT 15000 close to modern humans and less similar to the great apes. CONCLUSION: Obstetrical mechanics evolved from dystocic delivery with a transverse orientation in Australopithecus to delivery with a modern human-like rotational birth and an increase in the anteroposterior diameters in H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis and modern H. sapiens.",1.695,259

 States of America",2011,"Unique among animals, humans eat a diet rich in cooked and nonthermally processed food. The ancestors of modern humans who invented food processing (including cooking) gained critical advantages in survival and fitness through increased caloric intake. However, the time and manner in which food processing became biologically significant are uncertain. Here, we assess the inferred evolutionary consequences of food processing in the human lineage by applying a Bayesian phylogenetic outlier test to a comparative dataset of feeding time in humans and nonhuman primates. We find that modern humans spend an order of magnitude less time feeding than predicted by phylogeny and body mass (4.7% vs. predicted 48% of daily activity). This result suggests that a substantial evolutionary rate change in feeding time occurred along the human branch after the human-chimpanzee split. Along this same branch, Homo erectus shows a marked reduction in molar size that is followed by a gradual, although erratic, decline in H. sapiens. We show that reduction in molar size in early Homo (H. habilis and H. rudolfensis) is explicable by phylogeny and body size alone. By contrast, the change in molar size to H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens cannot be explained by the rate of craniodental and body size evolution. Together, our results indicate that the behaviorally driven adaptations of food processing (reduced feeding time and molar size) originated after the evolution of Homo but before or concurrent with the evolution of H. erectus, which was around 1.9 Mya.",9.674,803

Because of their highly mutable nature, proximity to the +1 transcription start site (TSS), and the emerging evidence of functional impact on gene expression, core promoter short tandem repeats (STRs) may be considered an ideal source of variation across species. In a genome-scale analysis of the entire Homo sapiens protein-coding genes, we have previously identified core promoters with at least one STR of >/= 6-repeats, with possible selective advantage in this species. In the current study, we performed reverse analysis of the entire Homo sapiens orthologous genes in mouse in the Ensembl database, in order to identify conserved STRs that have shrunk as an evolutionary advantage to humans. Two protocols were used to minimize ascertainment bias. Firstly, two species sharing a more recent ancestor with Homo sapiens (i.e. Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were also included in the study. Secondly, four non-primate species encompassing the major orders across Mammals, including Scandentia, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria, and Xenarthra were analyzed as out-groups. We introduce STR evolutionary events specifically identical in primates (i.e. Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla gorilla) vs. non-primate out-groups. The average frequency of the identically shared STR motifs across those primates ranged between 0.00005 and 0.06. The identified genes are involved in important evolutionary and developmental processes, such as normal craniofacial development (TFAP2B), regulation of cell shape (PALMD), learning and long-term memory (RGS14), nervous system development (GFRA2), embryonic limb morphogenesis (PBX2), and forebrain development (APAF1).

Attempts to develop effective vaccines or pharmacological treatments to inhibit RSV infection without undesired effects on human health have been unsuccessful. However, RSV infection has been reported to be affected by flavonoids. The mechanisms underlying viral inhibition induced by these compounds are largely unknown, making the development of new drugs difficult. METHODS: To understand the mechanisms induced by flavonoids to inhibit RSV infection, a systems pharmacology-based study was performed using microarray data from primary culture of human bronchial cells infected by RSV, together with compound-proteomic interaction data available for Homo sapiens. RESULTS: After an initial evaluation of 26 flavonoids, 5 compounds (resveratrol, quercetin, myricetin, apigenin, and tricetin) were identified through topological analysis of a major chemical-protein (CP) and protein-protein interacting (PPI) network. In a nonclustered form, these flavonoids regulate directly the activity of two protein bottlenecks involved in inflammation and apoptosis.

In this paper we report our in silico and in vitro data on (i) the genomics of the TBPL2 gene in Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis, and Takifugu rubripes; (ii) its evolution and phylogenetic relationship with TBP, TBPL1, and TRF; (iii) the structure of the TBPL2 proteins that belong to the recently identified group of the intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs); and (iv) TBPL2 expression in different organs and cell types of Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus. Similar to TBP, both the TBPL2 gene and protein are bimodular. The 3' region of the gene encoding the DNA binding domain (DBD) was well conserved during evolution. Its high homology to vertebrate TBP suggests that TBPL2 also should bind to the TATA box and interact with the proteins binding to TBP carboxy-terminal domain, such as the TBP associated factors (TAFs). As already demonstrated for TBP, TBPL2 amino-terminal segment is intrinsically unstructured and, even though variable among vertebrates, comprises a highly conserved motif not found in any other known protein. Absence of TBPL2 from the genome of invertebrates and plants demonstrates its specific origin within the subphylum of vertebrates. Our RT-PCR analysis of human and rat RNA shows that, similar to TBP, TBPL2 is ubiquitously synthesized even though at variable levels that are at least two orders of magnitude lower. Higher expression of TBPL2 in the gonads than in other organs suggests that it could perform important functions in gametogenesis.

Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure.

The recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion, and identified by sequencing. Molecular characterization analyses of the neuA nucleotide amino acid sequence were performed using bioinformatic tools and an online server. The results showed that the neuA nucleotide sequence contained a complete coding region, which comprised 1242 bp, encoding 413 amino acids (aa). The aa sequence was highly conserved and contained a Glyco_tranf_GTA_type superfamily and an SGNH_hydrolase superfamily conserved domain, which are related to sialic acid activation catalysis. The NeuA protein possessed many important sites related to post-translational modification, including 28 potential phosphorylation sites and 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, had no signal peptides or transmembrane regions, and was predicted to reside in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the protein had some B-cell epitopes, which suggests its potential in development of a vaccine against S. agalactiae infection. The codon usage frequency of neuA differed greatly in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens genes, and neuA may be more efficiently expressed in eukaryotes (yeast).

Here we present a study of the root morphology of the Miocene Chadian hominin Sahelanthropus tchadensis and its comparison to other hominins. The morphology of the whole lower dentition (I1 -M3 ) was investigated and described. The comparison with the species Ardipithecus kaddaba and Ardipithecus ramidus indicates a global homogeneity of root morphology in early hominins. This morphology, characterized notably by a reduction of the size and number of the roots of premolars, is a composite between an ape-like morphology and the later hominin morphology. Trends for root evolution in hominins are proposed, including the transition from a basal hominoid to extant Homo sapiens. This study also illustrates the low association between the evolution of tooth root morphology and the evolution of crowns in hominins.",2.379,1081

In-house developed Perl scripts were used to search and process the data and to translate each gene-level mutation into a mutated peptide sequence. The cancer and disease mutation databases comprise a total of 872,125 and 27,148 peptide entries from 25 642 and 2913 proteins, respectively. A description line for each entry provides the parent protein ID and name, the cDNA- and protein-level mutation site and type, the originating database, and the disease or cancer tissue type and corresponding hits. The two databases are FASTA-formatted to enable data retrieval by commonly used tandem MS search engines. While the largest number of mutations were encountered for the amino acids A/D/E/G/L/P/R/S, the global mutation profiles replicate closely the outcome of the 1000 Genomes Project aimed at cataloguing natural mutations in the human population. The affected proteins were primarily involved in transcription regulation, splicing, protein synthesis/folding/binding, redox/energy production, adhesion/motility, and to some extent in DNA damage repair and signaling. The applicability of the database to identifying the presence of mutated peptides was investigated with MCF-7 breast cancer cell extracts.",4.245,70
15454335,Influences of limb proportions and body size on locomotor kinematics in terrestrial primates and fossil hominins.,['Polk JD'],Journal of human evolution,2004,"During locomotion, mammalian limb postures are influenced by many factors including the animal's limb length and body mass. Polk (2002) compared the gait of similar-sized cercopithecine monkeys that differed limb proportions and found that longer-limbed monkeys usually adopt more extended joint postures than shorter-limbed monkeys in order to moderate their joint moments. Studies of primates as well as non-primate mammals that vary in body mass have demonstrated that larger animals use more extended limb postures than smaller animals. Such extended postures in larger animals increase the extensor muscle mechanical advantage and allow postures to be maintained with relatively less muscular effort (Polk, 2002; Biewener 1989). The results of these previous studies are used here to address two anthropological questions. The first concerns the postural effects of body mass and limb proportion differences between australopithecines and members of the genus Homo. That is, H. erectus and later hominins all have larger body mass and longer legs than australopithecines, and these anatomical differences suggest that Homo probably used more extended postures and probably required relatively less muscular force to resist gravity than the smaller and shorter-limbed australopithecines. The second question investigates how animals with similar size but different limb proportions differ in locomotor performance. The effects of limb proportions on gait are relevant to inferring postural and locomotor differences between Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens which differ in their crural indices and relative limb length. This study demonstrates that primates with relatively long limbs achieve higher walking speeds while using lower stride frequencies and lower angular excursions than shorter-limbed monkeys, and these kinematic differences may allow longer-limbed taxa to locomote more efficiently than shorter-limbed species of similar mass. Such differences may also have characterized the gait of Homo sapiens in comparison to Neanderthals, but more experimental data on humans that vary in limb proportions are necessary in order to evaluate this question more thoroughly.",3.733,1658

In humans, around 700 human miRNA nucleotides have been verified, which interfere with 30% of all genes. Recently, the role of miRNA in cardiovascular research gained attention and the involvement of miRNAs in several cardiovascular diseases has been identified. In this review, we focus on the role of miRNAs in atherosclerosis and in particular on the potential role of miRNAs in the development of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. The role of miRNA in the main characteristics of these plaques, inflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis will be discussed.

RESULTS: The pelves of prehistoric female were similar in shape with modern female. However, they differ in relative dimensions (transversal diameter of the pelvis inlet: respectively 118 mm vs 125 mm, p=0.02). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Reconstructions based on Neolithic hominin fossils suggest that obstetrical mechanisms were probably common to Neolithic and modern humans: childbirth would probably require social adaptations and risks of perinatal and obstetric complications were undoubtedly high. However, the differences in morphometric analysis could suggest a change of human pelvis and raise the question of the evolution in obstetrical mechanisms in the future.",0.522,1432

We show that the probability of Poincare recurrences decays in an algebraic way with the Poincare exponent beta approximately 4 even if the oscillatory dependence is well pronounced. The correlations between recurrences decay with an exponent nu approximately 0.6 that leads to an anomalous superdiffusive walk. However, for Homo sapiens sequences, with the largest available statistics, the diffusion coefficient converges to a finite value on distances larger than one million base pairs. We argue that the approach based on Poncare recurrences determines new proximity features between different species and sheds a new light on their evolution history.",0,1149

A multiple alignment and a phylogenetic tree of all 60 CH domains found in 36 proteins showed that most CH domains can be assigned to one of 6 types. We have then distributed the proteins into several classes according to the type and arrangement of the CH domains. Most proteins belong to the class of ABD (actin-binding domain)-forming CH tandems (CH1-CH2) of the alpha-actinin and fimbrin families or to the class of CH3 domain-bearing proteins. There are a few examples of proteins with a single CH1 or CH2 domain, one with a CH1-CH1 doublet and a single representative of the CHe class of microtubule-binding proteins. A comparison with CH domain proteins in Homo sapiens suggests that while the individual domains are available in both species, the existence of identical multidomain proteins in toto is rare. Fimbrin 1, alpha-actinin and EB1 appear as perfect orthologs in both species, whereas filamin and interaptin may represent ancestral forms of human filamin and nesprins. In four more cases (NAV/Unc-53-, smoothelin-, transgelin- and Gas2-related proteins) functional data are needed in order to establish a potential relationship with a human counterpart.

We found that Ateles geoffroyi responded with significant preferences for seven amino acids (glycine, l-proline, l-alanine, l-serine, l-glutamic acid, l-aspartic acid, and l-lysine) when presented at a concentration of 100mM and/or 200mM and tested against water. At the same concentrations, the animals significantly rejected five amino acids (l-tryptophan, l-tyrosine, l-valine, l-cysteine, and l-isoleucine) and were indifferent to the remaining tastants. Further, the results show that the spider monkeys discriminated concentrations as low as 0.2mM l-lysine, 2mM l-glutamic acid, 10mM l-proline, 20mM l-valine, 40mM glycine, l-serine, and l-aspartic acid, and 80mM l-alanine from the alternative stimulus, with individual animals even scoring lower threshold values. A comparison between the taste qualities of the proteinogenic amino acids as described by humans and the preferences and aversions observed in the spider monkeys suggests a fairly high degree of agreement in the taste quality perception of these tastants between the two species. A comparison between the taste preference thresholds obtained with the spider monkeys and taste detection thresholds reported in human subjects suggests that the taste sensitivity of A. geoffroyi for the amino acids tested here might match that of Homo sapiens. The results support the assumption that the taste responses of spider monkeys to proteinogenic amino acids might reflect an evolutionary adaptation to their frugivorous and thus protein-poor diet.",2.976,1024
27487209,Emergence of a Homo sapiens-specific gene family and chromosome 16p11.2 CNV susceptibility.,[],Nature,2016,"Genetic differences that specify unique aspects of human evolution have typically been identified by comparative analyses between the genomes of humans and closely related primates, including more recently the genomes of archaic hominins. Not all regions of the genome, however, are equally amenable to such study. Recurrent copy number variation (CNV) at chromosome 16p11.2 accounts for approximately 1% of cases of autism and is mediated by a complex set of segmental duplications, many of which arose recently during human evolution. Here we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the locus and identify bolA family member 2 (BOLA2) as a gene duplicated exclusively in Homo sapiens. We estimate that a 95-kilobase-pair segment containing BOLA2 duplicated across the critical region approximately 282 thousand years ago (ka), one of the latest among a series of genomic changes that dramatically restructured the locus during hominid evolution. All humans examined carried one or more copies of the duplication, which nearly fixed early in the human lineage--a pattern unlikely to have arisen so rapidly in the absence of selection (P < 0.0097). We show that the duplication of BOLA2 led to a novel, human-specific in-frame fusion transcript and that BOLA2 copy number correlates with both RNA expression (r = 0.36) and protein level (r = 0.65), with the greatest expression difference between human and chimpanzee in experimentally derived stem cells. Analyses of 152 patients carrying a chromosome 16p11. rearrangement show that more than 96% of breakpoints occur within the H. sapiens-specific duplication. In summary, the duplicative transposition of BOLA2 at the root of the H. sapiens lineage about 282 ka simultaneously increased copy number of a gene associated with iron homeostasis and predisposed our species to recurrent rearrangements associated with disease.",41.456,8

9719622,Scientific meaning of meanings: quests for discoveries concerning our cultural ills.,[],Environmental research,1998,"This paper outlines pioneering concepts of fundamental physical and emotional features of the human brain which served as primary operators. These have developed during the past 10,000 years, giving rise to our present global megacultures and their various ancestral culture progenitors. Essential points are these: (1) Biological evolution endowed the human brain (quite inadvertently and unintentionally) with enormous latent powers for complex and sophisticated abstract ratiocinations. (2) Magnitudes of these latent powers grew exponentially with linear enlargements of brain size during the evolution of the genetic ancestors of Homo sapiens sapiens (Hss) during the past 3 million years, but these latent powers never materialized in utilized forms within the environmental contexts in which they evolved. (3) These sophisticated, abstract ratiocinations, both latent powers and operative forms in today's Hss brain, are divided between two major categories: utilitarian thinking and nonutilitarian thinking. (4) These two different types of thinking processes are carried out within separate, different regional combinations of neuronal biochemical entities within the same individual brain. (5) Sensitivities of abstract, sophisticated ratiocination processes within the human brain to influences from communication interactions with other human brains are exponentially greater in comparison with any other species of central nervous system in the earth's biosphere. This makes the brain population density the utmost critical factor, and determines the character of human thought within interacting populations of brains at a given time and place within a particular culture. (6) Abrupt increases of sedentary brain population densities, unnaturally greater by orders of magnitude than those that existed previously in biological evolutionary contexts, were engendered by the inauguration of agricultural practices 10,000 years ago. This enabled latent powers of the human brain used for complex and sophisticated abstract ratiocinations to become manifest in materialized forms of usage within relatively large groups of humans living i certain regions of the earth. (7) Thinking processes of the utilitarian category within brains living in such regions guided and dominated the development of sophisticated and complex social hierarchies and institutions, forms of communication, technologies, and cultures since that time. This dominating factor relegated thinking processes within the nonutilitarian categories of those brains to subservient roles during those developments. (8) Nonutilitarian abstracts ratiocinations possess a potential for proper adjudication and guidance of utilitarian abstract ratiocinations in the latter's development of culture. However, lack of the former's proper role in cultural developments since the beginning of the Holocene interglacial era has resulted in the imprisonment of Hss as aliens in an intellectual hell on a foreign planet.",4.373,1895

Countering this common intuition, in this article, we argue that in an uncertain world actually the opposite is true: Humans do not need complex cognitive strategies to make good inferences, estimations, and other judgments; rather, it is the very simplicity and robustness of our cognitive repertoire that makes Homo sapiens a capable decision maker.",1.388,1538

However, summarizing all the regulatory networks involved in NPC is challenging. In the present study, the genes, miRNAs and TFs involved in NPC were considered as the nodes of the so-called regulatory network, and the associations between them were investigated. To clearly represent these associations, three regulatory networks were built seperately, namely, the differentially expressed network, the associated network and the global network. The differentially expressed network is the most important one of these three networks, since its nodes are differentially expressed genes whose mutations may lead to the development of NPC. Therefore, by modifying the aberrant expression of those genes that are differentially expressed in this network, their dysregulation may be corrected and the tumorigenesis of NPC may thus be prevented. Analysis of the aforementioned three networks highlighted the importance of certain pathways, such as self-adaptation pathways, in the development of NPC. For example, cyclin D1 (CCND1) was observed to regulate Homo sapiens-miR-20a, which in turn targeted CCND1. The present study conducted a systematic analysis of the pathogenesis of NPC through the three aforementioned regulatory networks, and provided a theoretical model for biologists. Future studies are required to evaluate the influence of the highlighted pathways in NPC.",1.554,652

All combine a relatively primitive postcranial skeleton, a dentition with expanded chewing teeth and a small brain. The most primitive species in our own genus, Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis, are little advanced over the australopithecines and with hindsight their inclusion in Homo may not be appropriate. The first species to share a substantial number of features with later Homo is Homo ergaster, or 'early African Homo erectus', which appears in the fossil record around 2.0 Myr. Outside Africa, fossil hominids appear as Homo erectus-like hominids, in mainland Asia and in Indonesia close to 2 Myr ago; the earliest good evidence of 'archaic Homo' in Europe is dated at between 600-700 Kyr before the present. Anatomically modern human, or Homo sapiens, fossils are seen first in the fossil record in Africa around 150 Kyr ago.

Although many computational approaches have been developed in recent years to predict protein function, most of these traditional algorithms do not take interrelationships among functional terms into account, such as different GO terms usually coannotate with some common proteins. In this study, we propose a new functional similarity measure in the form of Jaccard coefficient to quantify these interrelationships and also develop a framework for incorporating GO term similarity into protein function prediction process. The experimental results of cross-validation on S. cerevisiae and Homo sapiens data sets demonstrate that our method is able to improve the performance of protein function prediction. In addition, we find that small size terms associated with a few of proteins obtain more benefit than the large size ones when considering functional interrelationships. We also compare our similarity measure with other two widely used measures, and results indicate that when incorporated into function prediction algorithms, our proposed measure is more effective. Experiment results also illustrate that our algorithms outperform two previous competing algorithms, which also take functional interrelationships into account, in prediction accuracy. Finally, we show that our method is robust to annotations in the database which are not complete at present. These results give new insights about the importance of functional interrelationships in protein function prediction.",1.811,1318

ZNF593 contains a classic C(2)H(2) zinc finger domain flanked by about 40 disordered residues on each terminus. Although the protein contains a high degree of intrinsic disorder, the structure of the zinc finger domain was resolved by NMR spectroscopy without a need for N- or C-terminal truncations. The tertiary structure of the zinc finger domain is composed of a beta-hairpin that positions the cysteine side chains for zinc coordination, followed by an atypical kinked alpha-helix containing the two histidine side chain ligands. The structural topology of ZNF593 is similar to a fragment of the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Zfa and the C-terminal zinc finger of MBP-1, a human enhancer binding protein. The structure presented here will provide a guide for future functional studies of how ZNF593 negatively modulates the DNA-binding activity of Oct-2, a POU domain-containing transcription factor.

Then they made choices in which only one option was visible, and they had to estimate the quantity for the other option. Both species were guided by the past outcomes, as they shifted from selecting the known option to selecting the unknown option at the point at which the known option went from being greater than the average rate of return to being less than the average rate of return.

Indices of the inlet and mid-plane were also calculated. Statistical analysis of the data (Student's t-test and principal component analysis) revealed that the variables which display sexual differences are the transverse diameter of the inlet, the antero-posterior and transverse diameters of the mid-plane and the mid-plane index. In particular, Spanish women have significantly higher values in the transverse diameter of the inlet and the antero-posterior and transverse diameter of the mid-plane than men; and Spanish men have significantly higher values in the mid-plane index than women. The results of this study are in accordance with those obtained in previous studies based on dry bone, which suggest considerable populational variability in pelvic and birth canal geometry.

We sought to ascertain the degree of functional conservation shared by Homo sapiens ARGONAUTE 2 (HsAGO2) and Arabidopsis thaliana ARGONAUTE 1 (AtAGO1), which are the predominant AGO family members involved with miRNA activity in their respective species. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing HsAGO2 were indistinguishable from counterparts over-expressing AtAGO1, each group exhibiting the morphological and molecular hallmarks of miRNA-pathway loss-of-function alleles. However, unlike AtAGO1, HsAGO2 was unable to rescue the ago1-27 allele. We conclude that, despite the evolutionary gulf between them, HsAGO2 is likely capable of interacting with some component/s of the Arabidopsis miRNA pathway, thereby perturbing its operation, although differences have arisen such that HsAGO2 alone is insufficient to confer efficient silencing of miRNA targets in planta.",3.948,1249

This paper presents a novel sequence encoding approach based on the adjacent di-nucleotide dependencies in which the donor splice site motifs are encoded into numeric vectors. The encoded vectors are then used as input in Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bagging, Boosting, Logistic regression, kNN and Naive Bayes classifiers for prediction of donor splice sites. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the donor splice site sequence data of Homo sapiens, collected from Homo Sapiens Splice Sites Dataset (HS3D). The results showed that RF outperformed all the considered classifiers. Besides, RF achieved higher prediction accuracy than the existing methods viz., MEM, MDD, WMM, MM1, NNSplice and SpliceView, while compared using an independent test dataset. CONCLUSION: Based on the proposed approach, we have developed an online prediction server (MaLDoSS) to help the biological community in predicting the donor splice sites. The server is made freely available at http://cabgrid.res.in:8080/maldoss. Due to computational feasibility and high prediction accuracy, the proposed approach is believed to help in predicting the eukaryotic gene structure.",2.024,397

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a molecular target with a considerable amount of data related to its sequence and 3-dimensional structure. In addition, there are structural insights about the mechanism of action of the natural substrate and drugs used in Alzheimer's disease, organophosphorus compounds, among others. We looked for AChE structural data useful for in silico design of potential interacting molecules. In particular, we focused on information regarding the design of ligands aimed to reactivate AChE catalytic activity. The structures of 178 AChE were annotated and categorized on different subsets according to the nature of the ligand, source organisms and experimental details. We compared sequence homology among the active site from Torpedo californica, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens with the latter two species having the closest relationship (88.9% identity). In addition, the mechanism of organophosphorus binding and the design of effective reactivators are reviewed. A curated data collection obtained with information from several sources was included for researchers working on the field. Finally, a molecular dynamics simulation with human AChE indicated that the catalytic pocket volume stabilizes around 600 A(3), providing additional clues for drug design.",1.722,631

The archaeological site of HDP1 dates to the last interglacial and consists of three phases of occupation, each containing abundant lithic artifacts, shellfish, terrestrial fauna, ostrich eggshell and pieces of ground ocher. The site provides an excellent case study to analyze human behavioral adaptations linked to early exploitation of marine resources. Here we reconstruct human activities through a detailed study of the lithic assemblages, combining analyses of the reduction sequences, artifact attributes and quartz fracturing. These methods provide insights into raw material procurement, lithic reduction sequences, site use and mobility patterns, and foster comparison with other MSA coastal sites. The main characteristics of the lithic assemblages remain constant throughout the use of the site. Quartz dominates silcrete and other raw materials by almost four to one. Knappers at HDP1 produced different forms of flakes using multiple core reduction methods. Denticulates represent the most frequent tool type. The assemblages document complete, bipolar and hard hammer reduction sequences for the locally available quartz, but highly truncated reduction sequences with many isolated end products for silcrete, a material with a minimum transport distance of 10-30km. This observation suggests that well provisioned individuals executed planned movements to the shoreline to exploit shellfish. Our excavations at HDP1 furthermore demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of flexible raw material use, anticipated long-distance transport, systematic gathering of shellfish and use of ground ocher. The HDP1 lithic assemblages document a robust pattern of land-use that we interpret as a stable adaptation of modern humans to coastal landscapes as early as MIS 5e.",3.733,1118

Most notable among these are schizophrenia and autism. One hypothesis has posited that these diseases have arisen as a consequence of human brain evolution, for example, that the same processes that led to advances in cognition, language, and executive function also resulted in novel diseases in humans when dysfunctional. Here, the molecular evolution of the protein-coding regions of genes associated with these and other psychiatric disorders are compared among species. Genes associated with psychiatric disorders are drawn from the literature and orthologous sequences are collected from eleven primate species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, macaque, baboon, marmoset, squirrel monkey, and galago) and 34 non-primate mammalian species. Evolutionary parameters, including dN/dS, are calculated for each gene and compared between disease classes and among species, focusing on humans and primates compared to other mammals, and on large-brained taxa (cetaceans, rhinoceros, walrus, bear, and elephant) compared to their small-brained sister species. Evidence of differential selection in humans to the exclusion of non-human primates was absent, however elevated dN/dS was detected in catarrhines as a whole, as well as in cetaceans, possibly as part of a more general trend. Although this may suggest that protein changes associated with schizophrenia and autism are not a cost of the higher brain function found in humans, it may also point to insufficiencies in the study of these diseases including incomplete or inaccurate gene association lists and/or a greater role of regulatory changes or copy number variation. Through this work a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain, the pathophysiology of disease, and the genetic basis of human psychiatric disease is gained.",2.986,816

Currently, no enzyme is known that reverses ARTD10-catalyzed mono-ADP-ribosylation.

They also express the ideas they form using structured articulate language. No other living creature does either of these things. Yet it is evident that we are descended from a non-symbolic and non-linguistic ancestor. How did this astonishing transformation occur? Scrutiny of the fossil and archaeological records reveals that the transition to symbolic reasoning happened very late in hominid history - indeed, within the tenure of anatomically recognizable Homo sapiens. It was evidently not simply a passive result of the increase in brain size that typified multiple lineages of the genus Homo over the Pleistocene. Instead, a brain exaptively capable of complex symbolic manipulation and language acquisition was acquired in the major developmental reorganization that gave rise to the anatomically distinctive species Homo sapiens. The new capacity it conferred was later recruited through the action of a cultural stimulus, most plausibly the spontaneous invention of language.",2.095,262
20034525,Functional characterization of two human receptor activity-modifying protein 3 variants.,"['Bailey RJ', 'Bradley JW', 'Poyner DR', 'Rathbone DL', 'Hay DL']",Peptides,2010,"Adrenomedullin (AM) and amylin are involved in angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis and glucose homeostasis/food intake, respectively. They activate receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP)/G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) complexes. RAMP3 with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) forms the AM(2) receptor, whereas when paired with the calcitonin receptor AMY(3) receptors are formed. RAMP3 interacts with other GPCRs although the consequences of these interactions are poorly understood. Therefore, variations in the RAMP3 sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or mutations could be relevant to human health. Variants of RAMP3 have been identified. In particular, analysis of AK222469 (Homo sapiens mRNA for receptor (calcitonin) activity-modifying protein 3 precursor variant) revealed several nucleotide differences, three of which encoded amino acid changes (Cys40Trp, Phe100Ser, Leu147Pro). Trp56Arg RAMP3 is a polymorphic variant of human RAMP3 at a conserved amino acid position. To determine their function we used wild-type (WT) human RAMP3 as a template for introducing amino acid mutations. Mutant or WT RAMP3 function was determined in Cos-7 cells with CLR or the calcitonin receptor (CT((a))). Cys40Trp/Phe100Ser/Leu147Pro RAMP3 was functionally compromised, with reduced AM and amylin potency at the respective AM(2) and AMY(3(a)) receptor complexes. Cys40Trp and Phe100Ser mutations contributed to this phenotype, unlike Leu147Pro. Reduced cell-surface expression of mutant receptor complexes probably explains the functional data. In contrast, Trp56Arg RAMP3 was WT in phenotype. This study provides insight into the role of these residues in RAMP3. The existence of AK222469 in the human population has implications for the function of RAMP3/GPCR complexes, particularly AM and amylin receptors.",2.618,1783

Here, we focused on a genomic analysis of the genes involved in the NEDD8 conjugation pathway in Schistosoma mansoni. The results revealed seven genes related to NEDD8 conjugation that are conserved in Schistosoma japonicum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens.

Upregulation was observed in 3-day-old schistosomula and adult worms for all analysed genes. We also analysed the transcription levels of Cullin family members Smp63 and Smp73, and observed upregulation in early schistosomula, while cercariae and adult worms showed expression levels similar to one another. Taken together, these results suggest that the NEDDylation/DeNEDDylation pathway controls important cellular regulators during worm development from cercariae to schistosomula and, finally, to adult.",1.859,1212
25751002,Autophagy-independent senescence and genome instability driven by targeted telomere dysfunction.,"['Mar FA', 'Debnath J', 'Stohr BA']",Autophagy,2015,"Telomere dysfunction plays a complex role in tumorigenesis. While dysfunctional telomeres can block the proliferation of incipient cancer clones by inducing replicative senescence, fusion of dysfunctional telomeres can drive genome instability and oncogenic genomic rearrangements. Therefore, it is important to define the regulatory pathways that guide these opposing effects. Recent work has shown that the autophagy pathway regulates both senescence and genome instability in various contexts. Here, we apply models of acute telomere dysfunction to determine whether autophagy modulates the resulting genome instability and senescence responses. While telomere dysfunction rapidly induces autophagic flux in human fibroblast cell lines, inhibition of the autophagy pathway does not have a significant impact upon the transition to senescence, in contrast to what has previously been reported for oncogene-induced senescence. Our results suggest that this difference may be explained by disparities in the development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. We also show that chromosome fusions induced by telomere dysfunction are comparable in autophagy-proficient and autophagy-deficient cells. Altogether, our results highlight the complexity of the senescence-autophagy interface and indicate that autophagy induction is unlikely to play a significant role in telomere dysfunction-driven senescence and chromosome fusions.",11.753,674

Their functional roles are defined by the genes they regulate. Uncovering these roles not only sheds light on the TF at hand but puts it into the context of the complete regulatory network. RESULTS: Here, we present an alignment- and threshold-free comparative genomics approach for assigning functional roles to DNA regulatory motifs. We incorporate our approach into the Gomo algorithm, a computational tool for detecting associations between a user-specified DNA regulatory motif [expressed as a position weight matrix (PWM)] and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Incorporating multiple species into the analysis significantly improves Gomo's ability to identify GO terms associated with the regulatory targets of TFs. Including three comparative species in the process of predicting TF roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens increases the number of significant predictions by 75 and 200%, respectively. The predicted GO terms are also more specific, yielding deeper biological insight into the role of the TF. Adjusting motif (binding) affinity scores for individual sequence composition proves to be essential for avoiding false positive associations. We describe a novel DNA sequence-scoring algorithm that compensates a thermodynamic measure of DNA-binding affinity for individual sequence base composition. GOMO's prediction accuracy proves to be relatively insensitive to how promoters are defined. Because GOMO uses a threshold-free form of gene set analysis, there are no free parameters to tune. Biologists can investigate the potential roles of DNA regulatory motifs of interest using GOMO via the web (http://meme.nbcr.net).",0,1834

This paper comprises a description and three-dimensional morphometric analysis of new carpals from at least one other individual at Liang Bua attributed to H. floresiensis: a right capitate and two hamates. The new capitate is smaller than that of LB1 but is nearly identical in morphology. As with capitates from extant apes, species of Australopithecus, and LB1, the newly described capitate displays a deeply-excavated nonarticular area along its radial aspect, a scaphoid facet that extends into a J-hook articulation on the neck, and a more radially-oriented second metacarpal facet; it also lacks an enlarged palmarly-positioned trapezoid facet. Because there is no accommodation for the derived, palmarly blocky trapezoid that characterizes Homo sapiens and Neandertals, this individual most likely had a plesiomorphically wedge-shaped trapezoid (like LB1). Morphometric analyses confirm the close similarity of the new capitate and that of LB1, and are consistent with previous findings of an overall primitive articular geometry. In general, hamate morphology is more conserved across hominins, and the H. floresiensis specimens fall at the far edge of the range of variation for H. sapiens in a number of metrics. However, the hamate of H. floresiensis is exceptionally small and exhibits a relatively long, stout hamulus lacking the oval-shaped cross-section characteristic of human and Neandertal hamuli (variably present in australopiths). Documentation of a second individual with primitive carpal anatomy from Liang Bua, along with further analysis of trapezoid scaling relative to the capitate in LB1, refutes claims that the wrist of the type specimen represents a modern human with pathology.

In this study, we investigated the phenomenon of chimerism in mitochondria to shed light on the origin of these organelles by determining which species played a role in their formation. We used the mitochondria of four distinct organisms, Reclinomonas americana, Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and multichromosome Pediculus humanus, and attempted to identify the origin of each mitochondrial gene. RESULTS: Our results suggest that the origin of mitochondrial genes is not limited to the Rickettsiales and that the creation of these genes did not occur in a single event, but through multiple successive events. Some of these events are very old and were followed by events that are more recent and occurred through the addition of elements originating from current species. The points in time that the elements were added and the parental species of each gene in the mitochondrial genome are different to the individual species. These data constitute strong evidence that mitochondria do not have a single common ancestor but likely have numerous ancestors, including proto-Rickettsiales, proto-Rhizobiales and proto-Alphaproteobacteria, as well as current alphaproteobacterial species. The analysis of the multichromosome P. humanus mitochondrion supports this mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: The most plausible scenario of the origin of the mitochondrion is that ancestors of Rickettsiales and Rhizobiales merged in a proto-eukaryotic cell approximately one billion years ago. The fusion of the Rickettsiales and Rhizobiales cells was followed by gene loss, genomic rearrangements and the addition of alphaproteobacterial elements through ancient and more recent recombination events. Each gene of each of the four studied mitochondria has a different origin, while in some cases, multichromosomes may allow for enhanced gene exchange. Therefore, the tree of life is not sufficient to explain the chimeric structure of current genomes, and the theory of a single common ancestor and a top-down tree does not reflect our current state of knowledge. Mitochondrial evolution constitutes a rhizome, and it should be represented as such.",4.658,148

The proportion of recombinants from unamplified library was 91.3% and the average length of exogenous inserts was 1.06kb. A total of 279 individual ESTs with sizes ranging from 316 to 1258bps were then analyzed.

However, the use of palaeoneurology to infer phylogenies of our genus is rare. Here we use cladistics to test the importance of the brain in differentiating and defining Neandertals and modern humans. The analysis is based on morphological data from the calvarium and endocast of Pleistocene fossils and results in a single most parsimonious cladogram. We demonstrate that the joint use of endocranial and calvarial features with cladistics provides a unique means to understand the evolution of the genus Homo. The main results of this study indicate that: (i) the endocranial features are more phylogenetically informative than the characters from the calvarium; (ii) the specific differentiation of Neandertals and modern humans is mostly supported by well-known calvarial autapomorphies; (iii) the endocranial anatomy of modern humans and Neandertals show strong similarities, which appeared in the fossil record with the last common ancestor of both species; and (iv) apart from encephalisation, human endocranial anatomy changed tremendously during the end of the Middle Pleistocene. This may be linked to major cultural and technological novelties that had happened by the end of the Middle Pleistocene (e.g., expansion of the Middle Stone Age (MSA) in Africa and Mousterian in Europe). The combined study of endocranial and exocranial anatomy offers opportunities to further understand human evolution and the implication for the phylogeny of our genus.",3.733,210

To maintain genomic stability, separase activity is strictly regulated by binding of an inhibitory protein, securin. Despite its central role in cell division, the separase and securin complex is poorly understood at the structural level. This is partly owing to the difficulty of generating a sufficient quantity of homogeneous, stable protein. Here, we report the production of Caenorhabditis elegans separase-securin complex, and its characterization using biochemical methods and by negative staining electron microscopy. Single particle analysis generated a density map at a resolution of 21-24 A that reveals a close, globular structure of complex connectivity harbouring two lobes. One lobe matches closely a homology model of the N-terminal HEAT repeat domain of separase, whereas the second lobe readily accommodates homology models of the separase C-terminal death and caspase-like domains. The globular structure of the C. elegans separase-securin complex contrasts with the more elongated structure previously described for the Homo sapiens complex, which could represent a different functional state of the complex, suggesting a mechanism for the regulation of separase activity through conformational change.",5.784,687

We identified four distinct transcripts: ubiquitous (3.5kb); ovary and early embryo specific (3.3kb); testis specific (1.9kb and 2.8kb) and nervous system specific (5.1kb). The pattern of Dm nxf1 gene expression in ovaries and early embryos (0-2h) is similar: the sizes of transcripts range from 3.0 to 3.5kb. We propose that this size variability may reflect the different extent of cytoplasmic polyadenylation. In testes, the 2.8-kb transcript originates from alternative termination of transcription and the 1.9-kb transcript is supposed to originate from an alternative transcription start. During ontogenesis, the 5.1-kb transcript can be clearly detected in 10- to 18-h-old embryos, most prominently in the nervous ganglia of larvae, and it represents a major species in imago head extracts.

Olfactomedin was originally identified as the major component of the mucus layer that surrounds the chemosensory dendrites of olfactory neurons. Homologues were subsequently found also in other tissues, including the brain and in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens. Most importantly, the TIGR/myocilin protein, expressed in the eye and associated with the pathogenesis of glaucoma, is an olfactomedin-related protein. The prevalence of olfactomedin-related proteins among species and their identification in different tissues prompted us to investigate whether a gene family exists within a species, specifically Homo sapiens. A GenBank search indeed revealed an entire human gene family of olfactomedin-related proteins with at least five members, designated hOlfA through hOlfD and the TIGR/myocilin protein. hOlfA corresponds to the rat neuronal AMZ protein. Phylogenetic analyses of 18 olfactomedin-related sequences resolved four distinct subfamilies. Among the human proteins, hOlfA and hOlfC, both expressed in brain, are most closely related. Northern blot analyses of 16 human tissues demonstrated highly specific expression patterns: hOlfA is expressed in brain, hOlfB in pancreas and prostate, hOlfC in cerebellum, hOlfD in colon, small intestine and prostate and TIGR/myocilin in heart and skeletal muscle. The link between TIGR/myocilin and ocular hypertension and the expression of several of these proteins in mucus-lined tissues suggest that they play an important role in regulating physical properties of the extracellular environment.

The objective of this study was to sequence and characterize Sox2 cDNA from the brain of C. dromedarius (also known as Arabian camel). A full coding sequence of the Sox2 gene from the brain of C. dromedarius was amplified by reverse transcription PCRjmc and then sequenced using the 3730XL series platform Sequencer (Applied Biosystem) for the first time. The cDNA sequence displayed an open reading frame of 822 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 273 amino acids. The molecular weight and the isoelectric point of the translated protein were calculated as 29.825 kDa and 10.11, respectively, using bioinformatics analysis. The predicted cSox2 protein sequence exhibited high identity: 99% for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, and Vicugna pacos; 98% for Sus scrofa and 93% for Camelus ferus. A 3D structure was built based on the available crystal structure of the HMG-box domain of human stem cell transcription factor Sox2 (PDB: 2 LE4) with 81 residues and predicting bioinformatics software for 273 amino acid residues. The comparison confirms the presence of the HMG-box domain in the cSox2 protein. The orthologous phylogenetic analysis showed that the Sox2 isoform from C. dromedarius was grouped with humans, alpacas, cattle, and pigs. We believe that this genetic and structural information will be a helpful source for the annotation. Furthermore, Sox2 is one of the transcription factors that contributes to the generation-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which in turn will probably help generate camel induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs).",0,698

The proportion of these two depends on the coupling efficiency of electrochemical gradient to synthesize ATP. Therefore, an increased basal metabolic rate caused by partial uncoupling of the mitochondria can be balanced by a high caloric intake provided by a high-fat diet. The recent study by Mishmar et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2003; 100: 171-176) suggested that ATP6 was the most variable gene among human mitochondrial DNAs and probably resulted from the adaptation of Homo sapiens to the colder climate during the migration out of Africa. According to this adaptation theory, the ATP6 of Homo sapiens (omnivorous animals consuming fat-containing diet) should be significantly different from that of other primates for permitting human adaptation to the dietary conditions. On the basis of this rationale, we analyzed ATP6 sequences of 136 unrelated Taiwanese subjects, which then were compared with 1,130 reported sequences. The obtained human consensus from 1,266 individuals was compared with that derived from 42 species of primates other than human. The alignment showed that human ATP6 harbored 80 variable residues, among which 25 amino acids were conserved in other primates, suggesting that adaptation constraints operating at the amino acid level results in the species-specific difference of ATP6. Therefore, these 25 amino acids are probably the human-specific adaptation residues of ATP6.",4.383,1754

P. falciparum (Pf) and Homo sapiens (Hs) OPRTs are characterized by highly dissociative transition states with ribocation character. On the basis of the geometrical and electrostatic features of the PfOPRT and HsOPRT transition states, analogues were designed, synthesized, and tested as inhibitors. Iminoribitol mimics of the ribocation transition state in linkage to pyrimidine mimics using methylene or ethylene linkers gave dissociation constants (Kd) as low as 80 nM. Inhibitors with pyrrolidine groups as ribocation mimics displayed slightly weaker binding affinities for OPRTs. Interestingly, p-nitrophenyl riboside 5'-phosphate bound to OPRTs with Kd values near 40 nM. Analogues designed with a C5-pyrimidine carbon-carbon bond to ribocation mimics gave Kd values in the range of 80-500 nM. Acyclic inhibitors with achiral serinol groups as the ribocation mimics also displayed nanomolar inhibition against OPRTs. In comparison with the nucleoside derivatives, inhibition constants of their corresponding 5'-phosphorylated transition state analogues are largely unchanged, an unusual property for a nucleotide-binding site. In silico docking of the best inhibitor into the HsOPRT active site supported an extensive hydrogen bond network associated with the tight binding affinity. These OPRT transition state analogues identify crucial components of potent inhibitors targeting OPRT enzymes.

HGT, as a mechanism of co-evolution between human and viruses, has been widely documented, however, the roles HGT play during the interaction between human and viruses are still in their infancy. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the genes horizontally transferred between viruses and their corresponding human hosts. Our study suggests that the HGT genes in human are predominantly enriched in immune related GO terms while viral HGT genes are tend to be encoded by viruses which promote the invasion of immune system of hosts. Based on our results, it gives us a hint about the evolution trajectory of HGT events.

The nucleotide contents, codon usage bias (CUB), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and effective number of codons (ENCs) values were investigated targeting overexpressing major inner capsid viral protein (VP6) of these AvRV species. The results confirm that the evolutionary characteristics influences the rotavirus (RV) genetic diversity and impact of host's natural selection on the AvRVs codons. Synonymous codon usage patterns were evaluated following multivariate statistical procedures on all available AvRV coding gene sequences. RSCU trees accommodated all AvRV species and preferred host sequences in one topology confirming greater imminence of AvRVs with the host chicken cell genes. Similarly, the codon adaptation index (CAI) results also displayed a higher adaptation of AvRVs to its chicken host. The codon preference analysis of RVs revealed that VP6 gene express more proficiently in the yeast system, whereas, codon optimization might be required for the effectual expression in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens.

Not surprisingly, there has been a recent renewed interest in deciduous dental variation, especially in the context of distinguishing Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens. Most studies of the deciduous dentition of fossil hominins have focused on standard metrical variation but morphological (non-metric and morphometric) variation also promises to shed light on long standing taxonomic questions. This study examines the taxonomic significance of the crown outline of the deciduous upper second molar through principal components analysis and linear discriminant analysis. We examine whether or not the crown shape of the upper deciduous second molar separates H. neanderthalensis from H. sapiens and explore whether it can be used to correctly assign individuals to taxa. It builds on previous studies by focusing on crown rather than cervical outline and by including a large sample of geographically diverse recent human populations. Our samples include 17 H. neanderthalensis, five early H. sapiens, and 12 Upper Paleolithic H. sapiens. In addition, we include two Homo erectus specimens in order to evaluate the polarity of crown shape differences observed between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. Our results show that crown outline shape discriminates H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis quite well, but does not do well at distinguishing H. erectus from H. sapiens. We conclude that the crown outline shape observed in H. sapiens is a primitive retention and that the skewed shape observed in H. neanderthalensis is a derived condition.

Virtual reconstructions of a Neanderthal neonate from Mezmaiskaya Cave (Russia) and of two Neanderthal infant skeletons from Dederiyeh Cave (Syria) now provide new comparative insights: Neanderthal brain size at birth was similar to that in recent Homo sapiens and most likely subject to similar obstetric constraints. Neanderthal brain growth rates during early infancy were higher, however. This pattern of growth resulted in larger adult brain sizes but not in earlier completion of brain growth. Because large brains growing at high rates require large, late-maturing, mothers [Leigh SR and Blomquist GE (2007) in Campbell CJ et al.

Testing these alternative models has proved intractable, however, as existing regional palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records remain spatially, stratigraphically, and chronologically disconnected from the archaeological record. Here we report high-resolution records of environmental shifts based on stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in ostrich eggshell (OES) fragments, faunal remains, and shellfish assemblages excavated from two key MSA archaeological sequences, Blombos Cave and Klipdrift Shelter. We compare these records with archaeological material remains in the same strata.

In this study, a full-length of peroxiredoxin 5 (designated EcPrx5) cDNA was cloned from the ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches. The full-length cDNA of the EcPrx5 was of 827 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 14 bp, a 3' UTR of 228 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame of 585 bp encoding a polypeptide of 194 amino acids with the predicted molecular weight of 20.83 kDa and estimated isoelectric point of 7.62. BLAST analysis revealed that amino acids of EcPrx5 shared 89, 68, 66, 65, 53 and 51 % identity with that of Macrobrachium rosenbergii, Megachile rotundata, Harpegnathos saltator, Acromyrmex echinatior, Danio rerio, and Homo sapiens counterparts, respectively. The conserved Prx domain and the signature of peroxiredoxin catalytic center identified in EcPrx5 suggested that EcPrx5 belonged to the atypical 2-Cys Prx subgroup. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that EcPrx5 could be detected in all the tested tissues with highest expression level in hepatopancreas. As time progressed, the expression level of EcPrx5 both in hemocytes and hepatopancreas increased in the first 6 h after Vibrio anguillarum and white spot syndrome virus challenge, and showed different expression profiles.

In this communication, we demonstrate that in the eukaryotic protein-protein interaction networks hubs tend to have a significantly higher number of splice variants than nonhubs. Also, hubs have a distinct frequency distribution of splice variants as compared to nonhubs. Furthermore, nodes with high number of splice variants, in general, are associated with high structural disorderedness. We also show that the degree of a node is substantially contributed by its structurally disordered splice variants. This suggests that the propensity of a node for a large number of interactions arises as a consequence of structurally disordered splice variants. Our work, therefore, sheds light on the phenomenon of alternative splicing as a significant contributor toward the",4.245,107

Therefore, cross-species extrapolation is fundamental to environmental risk assessment. Recognition of the impracticality of generating empirical, whole organism, toxicity data for the extensive universe of chemicals in commerce has been an impetus driving the field of predictive toxicology. We describe a strategy that leverages expanding databases of molecular sequence information together with identification of specific molecular chemical targets whose perturbation can lead to adverse outcomes to support predictive species extrapolation. This approach can be used to predict which species may be more (or less) susceptible to effects following exposure to chemicals with known modes of action (e.g., pharmaceuticals, pesticides). Primary amino acid sequence alignments are combined with more detailed analyses of conserved functional domains to derive the predictions. This methodology employs bioinformatic approaches to automate, collate, and calculate quantitative metrics associated with cross-species sequence similarity of key molecular initiating events (MIEs). Case examples focused on the actions of (a) 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol on the human (Homo sapiens) estrogen receptor; (b) permethrin on the mosquito (Aedes aegypti) voltage-gated para-like sodium channel; and (c) 17beta-trenbolone on the bovine (Bos taurus) androgen receptor are presented to demonstrate the potential predictive utility of this species extrapolation strategy. The examples compare empirical toxicity data to cross-species predictions of intrinsic susceptibility based on analyses of sequence similarity relevant to the MIEs of defined adverse outcome pathways. Through further refinement, and definition of appropriate domains of applicability, we envision practical and routine utility for the molecular target similarity-based predictive method in chemical risk assessment, particularly where testing resources are limited.",3.451,1113

 : JASS / Istituto italiano di antropologia",2015,"Neanderthals have been traditionally considered at the top of the food chain with a diet mostly consisting of animal proteins. New findings challenged this view and suggested that Neanderthals living in areas with more favourable climatic conditions exploited various food sources, including plant materials. In this study, the attention is focused on dental macrowear of Neanderthals from Central Italy, whose diet has been largely unexplored. Three-dimensional digital models of teeth have been examined through occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA), a method used to understand how wear facets are formed. The results show a close similarity between the specimens of Saccopastore 1 and 2, with a wear pattern that indicates the use of diverse sources of food, but with a predominance of animal proteins. On the other hand, the specimens of Guattari 2 and 3 display a slightly different dental wear from each other, which probably reflects the chronological sequence of the Guattari Cave. It appears that at the end of the marine isotope stage (MIS)5 the occupants of this cave consumed marginally more plant foods, while during MIS 3 they relied more on animal proteins. Finally, a close look at the Saccopastore maxillary molars reveals the presence of a distinct type of wear that has been previously described in some Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens from Near East, and it provides additional information about the culture and lifestyle of these Pleistocene human populations.",2.095,823

Previous studies have revealed two models for gene structure evolution through the loss of introns: RNA-based gene conversion, dubbed the Fink model and retroposition model. However, retrogenes that experienced both intron loss and intron-retaining events have been ignored; evolutionary processes responsible for the variation in complex exon-intron structure were unknown. We detected hundreds of retroduplication-derived genes in human (Homo sapiens), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and categorized them either as duplicated genes that have all introns lost or as duplicated genes that have at least lost one and retained one intron compared with the parental copy (intron-retaining [IR] type). Our new model attributes intron retention alternative splicing to the generation of these IR-type gene pairs. We presented 25 parental genes that have an intron retention isoform and have retained introns in the same locations in the IR-type duplicate genes, which directly support our hypothesis. Our alternative-splicing-based model in conjunction with the retroposition and Fink models can explain the IR-type gene observed. We discovered a greater percentage of IR-type genes in plants than in animals, which may be due to the abundance of intron retention cases in plants. Given the prevalence of intron retention in plants, this new model gives a support that plant genomes have very complex gene structures.",6.841,955

CBS uses coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) for catalysis, and S-adenosylmethionine regulates the activity of human CBS, but not yeast CBS. Human and fruit fly CBS contain heme; however, the role for heme is not clear. This paper reports biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of CBS from fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DmCBS) and the CO/NO gas binding reactions of DmCBS and human CBS. Like CBS enzymes from lower organisms (e.g., yeast), DmCBS is intrinsically highly active and is not regulated by AdoMet. The DmCBS heme coordination environment, the reactivity, and the accompanying effects on enzyme activity are similar to those of human CBS. The DmCBS heme bears histidine and cysteine axial ligands, and the enzyme becomes inactive when the cysteine ligand is replaced. The Fe(II) heme in DmCBS is less stable than that in human CBS, undergoing more facile reoxidation and ligand exchange. In both CBS proteins, the overall stability of the protein is correlated with the heme oxidation state. Human and DmCBS Fe(II) hemes react relatively slowly with CO and NO, and the rate of the CO binding reaction is faster at low pH than at high pH. Together, the results suggest that heme incorporation and AdoMet regulation in CBS are not correlated, possibly providing two independent means for regulating the enzyme.",3.015,118

It arose through retrotransposition from its parent gene, NANOG, which is expressed predominantly in embryonic stem cells. Based on identification of fixed and polymorphic variants in a genetically diverse set of human NANOG and NANOGP8 sequences, we estimated the evolutionary origin of NANOGP8 at approximately 0.9 to 2.5 million years ago, more recent than previously estimated. We also discovered that NANOGP8 arose from a derived variant allele of NANOG containing a 22-nucleotide pair deletion in the 3' UTR, which has remained polymorphic in modern humans. Evidence from our experiments indicates that NANOGP8 is fixed in modern humans even though its parent allele is polymorphic. The presence of NANOGP8-specific sequences in Neanderthal reads provided definitive evidence that NANOGP8 is also present in the Neanderthal genome. Some variants between the reference sequences of NANOG and NANOGP8 utilized in cancer research to distinguish RT-PCR products are polymorphic within NANOG or NANOGP8 and thus are not universally reliable as distinguishing features. NANOGP8 was inserted in reverse orientation into the LTR region of an SVA retroelement that arose in a human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor after divergence of the orangutan ancestral lineage. Transcription factor binding sites within and beyond this LTR may promote expression of NANOGP8 in cancer cells, although current evidence is inferential. The fact that NANOGP8 is a human-specific retro-oncogene may partially explain the higher genetic predisposition for cancer in humans compared with other primates.",0,1207
27003727,Kinetic and Binding Studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 2 Isopentenyl Diphosphate:Dimethylallyl Diphosphate Isomerase.,"['Janczak MW', 'Poulter CD']",Biochemistry,2016,"Type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI-2) converts isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the two fundamental building blocks of isoprenoid molecules. IDI-2 is found in many species of bacteria and is a potential antibacterial target since this isoform is non-homologous to the type 1 enzyme in Homo sapiens. IDI-2 requires a reduced flavin mononucleotide to form the catalytically active ternary complex, IDI-2.FMNH2.IPP. For IDI-2 from the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, the flavin can be treated kinetically as a dissociable cosubstrate in incubations with IPP and excess NADH. Under these conditions, the enzyme follows a modified sequential ordered mechanism where FMN adds before IPP. Interestingly, the enzyme shows sigmoidal behavior when incubated with IPP and NADH with varied concentrations of FMN in aerobic conditions. In contrast, sigmoidal behavior is not seen in incubations under anaerobic conditions where FMN is reduced to FMNH2 before the reaction is initiated by addition of IPP. Stopped-flow experiments revealed that FMN, whether bound to IDI-2 or without enzyme in solution, is slowly reduced in a pseudo-first-order reaction upon addition of excess NADH (k(red)(FMN) = 5.7 x 10(-3) s(-1) and k(red)(IDI-2.FMN) = 2.8 x 10(-3) s(-1)), while reduction of the flavin is rapid upon addition of NADH to a mixture of IDI-2.FMN, and IPP (k(red)(IDI-2.FMN.IPP) = 8.9 s(-1)). Similar experiments with dithionite as the reductant gave k(red)(FMN) = 221 s(-1) and k(red)(IDI-2.FMN) = 411 s(-1). Dithionite reduction of FMN in the IDI-2.FMN and IPP mixture was biphasic with k(red)(IDI-2.FMN.IPP (fast)) = 326 s(-1) and k(red)(IDI-2.FMN.IPP (slow)) = 6.9 s(-1) The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the slow component was similar to those for NADH reduction of the flavin in the IDI-2.FMN and IPP mixture and may reflect a rate-limiting conformational change in the enzyme.",3.015,689

Our analysis focused primarily on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where haploinsufficient genes (HI; genes with dominant loss-of-function mutations) were found to be participating in gene expression processes, namely, the translation and regulation of gene transcription. Non-ribosomal HI genes (mainly regulators of gene transcription) were found to have more GIs and GCIs than haplosufficient (HS) genes. Several properties seem to lead to the enrichment of interactions, most notably, the following: importance, pleiotropy, gene expression level and gene expression variation. Importantly, after these properties were appropriately considered in the analysis, the correlation between dominance and GI/GCI degrees was still observed. Strikingly, for the GCIs of heterozygous strains, haploinsufficiency was the only property significantly correlated with the number of GCIs. We found ribosomal HI genes to be depleted in GIs/GCIs. This finding can be explained by their high variation in gene expression under different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. We observed the same distributions of GIs among non-ribosomal HI, ribosomal HI and HS genes in three other species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. One potentially interesting exception was the lack of significant differences in the degree of GIs between non-ribosomal HI and HS genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.",1.4,724

In a previous study, we purified several subunits and their isoforms of the peripheral stalk region of Homo sapiens (human) V-ATPase; such as C1, E1G1, H, and the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of V(o), a1. Here, we investigated the in vitro binding interactions of the subunits at the stalk region and measured their specific affinities. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that the subunit C1 binds the E1G1 heterodimer with both high and low affinities (2.8 nM and 1.9 microM, respectively). In addition, an E1G1-H complex can be formed with high affinity (48 nM), whereas affinities of other subunit pairs appeared to be low ( approximately 0.21-3.0 microM). The putative ternary complex of C1-H-E1G1 was not much strong on co-incubation of these subunits, indicating that the two strong complexes of C1-E1G1 and H-E1G1 in cooperation with many other weak interactions may be sufficiently strong enough to withstand the torque of rotation during catalysis. We observed a partially stable quaternary complex (consisting of E1G1, C1, a1(NT), and H subunits) resulting from discrete peripheral subunit interactions stabilizing the complex through their intrinsic affinities. No binding was observed in the absence of E1G1 (using only H, C1, and a1(NT)); therefore, it is likely that, in vivo, the E1G1 heterodimer has a significant role in the initiation of subunit assembly. Multiple interactions of variable affinity in the stalk region may be important to the mechanism of reversible dissociation of the intact V-ATPase.",3.234,1190

Alterations in miRNA expression are reported in several human cancers, which suggests their potential roles in tumor initiation and progression. Members of the miR-302 cluster are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESC), where they regulate cell self-renewal and pluripotency. Based on the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, mis-expression of such genes might contribute to tumorigenicity. This study aims to find a potential link between the expression level of human/homo sapiens miR-302b (has-miR- 302b) and tumor/grade state of gastric tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A matched based case-control study was conducted that included tumor and matched marginal non-tumor surgical specimens from 34 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma. Randomly selected samples were obtained from the Iran National Tumor Bank. cDNA synthesis was carried out on total RNA, by using the miRCURY LNA(TM) Universal RT microRNA PCR Kit. Real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were performed with specific LNA(TM) primers and SYBR Green master mix. The human embryonic carcinoma cell line, NTERA2 (NT2) and a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, AGS, were used to optimize the PCR reactions. A comparative evaluation of miR-302b expression in tumor and non-tumor gastric samples was performed by either paired t test or Wilcoxon non-parametric test. The ability of miR-302b to discriminate tumor from non-tumor gastric samples was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: According to our data, miR-302b expression (normalized to that of the U6 snRNA housekeeping gene) in the pluripotent cell line NT2 was more than 500 times greater than that of the AGS cell line. The level of expression was even lower in tumor and non-tumor gastric tissue samples. The data further revealed a down-regulation of miR-302b in gastric tumor samples (p=0.001), particularly in high-grade adenocarcinoma (p=0.009). However, ROC analysis data demonstrated a low sensitivity and specificity of miR-302b expression to discriminate between the tumor and non-tumor state of the samples (AUC=0.63). CONCLUSION: Despite the upregulation of some hESC-specific genes in tumors, our data revealed a down-regulation of miR-302b in high-grade tumors.

The length of the genomic sequence is 3421 bp; it contains four exons and three introns. Alignment analysis indicates that the nucleotide sequence shares a high degree of homology with those of Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis, and Danio rerio (93.64, 83.37, 92.54, 91.89, 87.28, 84.21, and 84.87%, respectively). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the giant panda with those of these other species revealed that the RPS14 of giant panda is highly homologous with those of B. taurus, R. norvegicus and D. rerio (85.99, 99.34 and 99.34%, respectively), and is 100% identical with the others. This degree of conservation of RPS14 suggests evolutionary selection. Topology prediction shows that there are two N-glycosylation sites, three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, four N-myristoylation sites, two amidation sites, and one ribosomal protein S11 signature in the RPS14 protein of the giant panda. The RPS14 gene can be readily expressed in Escherichia coli. When it was fused with the N-terminally His-tagged protein, it gave rise to accumulation of an expected 22-kDa polypeptide, in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight. The expression product obtained can be purified for studies of its function.",0.775,1637

The fetal samples consist of 16 male pigtailed macaques (mean age, 20.5 gestational weeks) and 17 humans (9 males and 8 females; mean age, 29.5 gestational weeks). For each individual, three-dimensional coordinates of 18 landmarks on the skull were collected from three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) reconstructed images and two-dimensional CT axial slices. Early and late groups were created from the human (early mean age, 24 weeks, N = 8; late mean age, 34 weeks, N = 9) and macaque samples (early mean age, 17.7 weeks, N = 7; late mean age, 23 weeks, N = 9). Inter- and intraspecific comparisons were made between the early and late groups. To determine if macaques and humans share a common fetal pattern of relative growth, human change in shape estimated from a comparison of early and late groups was compared to the pattern estimated between early and late macaque groups. Euclidean distance matrix analysis was used in all comparisons. Intraspecific comparisons indicate that the growing fetal skull displays the greatest amount of change along mediolateral dimensions. Changes during human growth are primarily localized to the basicranium and palate, while macaques experience localized change in the midface. Interspecific comparisons indicate that the two primate species do not share a common pattern of relative growth, and the macaque pattern is characterized by increased midfacial growth relative to humans. Our results suggest that morphological differences in the craniofacial skeleton of these species are in part established by differences in fetal growth patterns.",2.379,423

The fact that small portions of the DNA of recent Homo sapiens derive from ancient populations in more than one region of the world makes our origins 'multiregional', but does that mean that the multiregional model of modern human origins has been proved correct? The extent of archaic assimilation in living humans remains modest, and fossil evidence outside of Africa shows little sign of the long-term morphological continuity through to recent humans expected from the multiregional model. Thus, rather than multiregionalism, a recent African origin (RAO) model for modern humans is still supported by the data.",16.196,408

They are organized in two gene clusters in human, one on 5p15.33 and the other one on 16q12.2, respectively, and both the organization and the structure of the genes are highly conserved. An open reading frame coding for an unknown protein is identified in the promoter of IRXA2 on chromosome 5p. This new gene is composed of four exons and it is orientated in a head-to-head manner to IRXA2. Only a short 851 bp segment separates the two translation start codons and the two genes may share a bi-directional promoter. This bi-directional promoter is embedded in a large CpG-island, that also continues into both genes. RT-PCR analysis of the new gene reveals two alternative mRNA transcripts and a third mRNA transcript can be predicted from EST clones. The expression profile of the gene analysed in 9 different human tissues reveals that it is expressed in a coordinated fashion with IRXA2, which has led to the name CEI (Coordinated Expression to IRXA2). The CEI protein lacks homology to any known protein or protein domain in public databases, and a putative amino terminal signal peptide suggests the protein is secreted or ER compartment located. The gene is only found in the human and the chimpanzee genome, but not in the mouse or the rat genome, which suggests that CEI is unique for higher primates. As the identified bi-directional promoter not being a relic of an ancient compact genome, CEI may play an important role in the evolution of higher primates in coordination with the IRX genes.",2.138,485

Such adult shape differences must ultimately be rooted in different developmental patterns, but it is unclear at which point during ontogeny these group characteristics emerge. Here we compared internal shape changes of the braincase from birth to adulthood in Neandertals (N = 10), modern humans (N = 62), and chimpanzees (N = 62). Incomplete fossil specimens, including the two Neandertal newborns from Le Moustier 2 and Mezmaiskaya, were reconstructed using reference-based estimation methods. We used 3D geometric morphometrics to statistically compare shapes of virtual endocasts extracted from computed-tomographic scans. Throughout the analysis, we kept track of possible uncertainties due to the missing data values and small fossil sample sizes. We find that some aspects of endocranial development are shared by the three species. However, in the first year of life, modern humans depart from this presumably ancestral pattern of development. Newborn Neandertals and newborn modern humans have elongated braincases, and similar endocranial volumes. During a 'globularization-phase' modern human endocasts change to the globular shape that is characteristic for Homo sapiens. This phase of early development is unique to modern humans, and absent from chimpanzees and Neandertals. Our results support the notion that Neandertals and modern humans reach comparable adult brain sizes via different developmental pathways. The differences between these two human groups are most prominent directly after birth, a critical phase for cognitive development.",3.733,1329

Somatic stimuli were applied to the lips, face, hand, trunk, and foot of 18 human subjects. Activity patterns were transposed onto three-dimensional magnetic resonance images of the brain so that the location of activity associated with the different stimuli could be related to specific regions of the cortex. There were several consistent findings. First, there were three regions of activity in the lateral sulcus associated with stimulation of the contralateral body. The most consistent locus of activation was on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus, continuing onto the operculum. The other two areas, one rostral and one caudal to this large central area, were smaller and were activated less consistently. Second, when activity patterns in the large central area resulting from stimulation of all body parts were considered, this region appeared to contain two fields that corresponded in location and somatotopic organization to the second somatosensory area (SII) and the parietal ventral area (PV). Finally, patterns of activation within SII and PV were somewhat variable across subjects. Repeated within-subject stimulus presentation indicated that differences across subjects were not due to inconsistent stimulus presentation. Comparisons with other mammals suggest that some features of organization are found only in primates. It is hypothesized that these features may be associated with manual dexterity and coordination of the hands, a characteristic generally restricted to the primate lineage.",0,533

Neither theory proved to be an accurate or better predictor for all groups. In contrast to the predictions of these theories, self-control was shown to vary according to species, human age group, and reinforcer quality. When the reinforcer was food, the self-control of different species was found to be negatively correlated with metabolic rate; that is, larger species showed greater self-control.

To study how the Neanderthal private alleles may have spread over the genes of Homo sapiens, we propose a deterministic model based on recursive equations and ordinary differential equations. If the Neanderthal population was large compared to the Homo sapiens population at the beginning of the contact period, we show that genetic introgression should have been fast and complete meaning that most of the Neanderthal private alleles should be found in the modern human gene pool in case of ancient admixture. In order to test/reject ancient admixture from genome-wide data, we incorporate the model of genetic introgression into a statistical hypothesis-testing framework. We show that the power to reject ancient admixture increases as the ratio, at the time of putative admixture, of the population size of Homo sapiens over that of Neanderthal decreases. We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size.",1.303,1427

However, enzymatic activity could be easily influenced by the temperature, pH, and circumstance. In the present study, we have developed the single-reaction monitoring (SRM) approach for measuring the absolute amount of SSAO expression in human umbilical artery based on LC-ESI-MS/MS. The measurement of protein was converted to the measurement of a unique peptide of SSAO from Homo sapiens. The peptide (YQLAVTQR) was confirmed to be unique to the SSAO in human using the ExPasy blast tools, and thus the synthetic peptide was used as the standard which can produce abundant parent ion (m/z = 490.0) and daughter ion (m/z = 687.4) in the mass spectrometry. Trap drive and fragmentation energy of MS/MS of the unique peptide was 60 V and 0.6 V, respectively.

Native Americans were thought to represent a small subset of the Eurasian population that migrated to the Western Hemisphere less than 15,000 years ago. Archeological discoveries since 2000 reveal, however, that Homo sapiens occupied the high-latitude region between Northeast Asia and northwest North America (that is, Beringia) before 30,000 years ago and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The settlement of Beringia now appears to have been part of modern human dispersal in northern Eurasia. A 2007 model, the Beringian Standstill Hypothesis, which is based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in living people, derives Native Americans from a population that occupied Beringia during the LGM. The model suggests a parallel between ancestral Native Americans and modern human populations that retreated to refugia in other parts of the world during the arid LGM. It is supported by evidence of comparatively mild climates and rich biota in south-central Beringia at this time (30,000-15,000 years ago).

In this manuscript a case is made for the hypothesis that H. sapiens is polytypic, and in this way is no different from other species exhibiting similar levels of genetic and morphological diversity. First it is demonstrated that the four major definitions of race/subspecies can be shown to be synonymous within the context of the framework of race as a correlation structure of traits. Next the issue of taxonomic classification is considered where it is demonstrated that H. sapiens possesses high levels morphological diversity, genetic heterozygosity and differentiation (F(ST)) compared to many species that are acknowledged to be polytypic with respect to subspecies. Racial variation is then evaluated in light of the phylogenetic species concept, where it is suggested that the least inclusive monophyletic units exist below the level of species within H. sapiens indicating the existence of a number of potential human phylogenetic species; and the biological species concept, where it is determined that racial variation is too small to represent differentiation at the level of biological species. Finally the implications of this are discussed in the context of anthropology where an accurate picture of the sequence and timing of events during the evolution of human taxa are required for a complete picture of human evolution, and medicine, where a greater appreciation of the role played by human taxonomic differences in disease susceptibility and treatment responsiveness will save lives in the future.",1.074,222

Here, we explore whether the fundamental frequency of the voice and handgrip strength account for differences in actual reproduction among a population of natural fertility humans. Our results show that both fundamental frequency and handgrip strength predict several measures of reproductive success among a group of indigenous Namibian females, particularly amongst the elderly, with weight also predicting reproductive outcomes among males.

The first of three hypotheses presented here proposes that a genetic defect, caused by either free radicals or a virus, deleted the gene needed by Anthropoidea to manufacture endogenous ascorbate. The second hypothesis proposes that this evolutionary accident permitted large numbers of free radicals to remain metabolically unquenched.

Here, we present a MATLAB-based program called detectIR for the perfect and imperfect inverted repeat detection that utilizes complex numbers and vector calculation and allows genome-scale data inputs. A novel algorithm is adopted in detectIR to convert the conventional sequence string comparison in inverted repeat detection into vector calculation of complex numbers, allowing non-complementary pairs (mismatches) in the pairing stem and a non-palindromic spacer (loop or gaps) in the middle of inverted repeats.

 : JASS / Istituto italiano di antropologia",2013,"The present paper examined the assumption of strong reproductive isolation (RI) between Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens, as well as the question of what form it might have taken, using insights from the parallel case of chimpanzee-bonobo hybridization. RI from hybrid sterility or inviability was thought unlikely based on the short separation-to-introgression timeline. The forms of RI that typically develop in primates have relatively short timelines (especially for partial implementation); they generally preclude mating or influence hybrid survival and reproduction in certain contexts, and they have the potential to skew introgression directionality. These RI barriers are also consistent with some interpretations of the archaeological and fossil records, especially when behavioral, cognitive, morphological, and genetic differences between the two human species are taken into consideration. Differences potentially influencing patterns of survival and reproduction include interspecies violence, Neandertal xenophobia, provisioning behavior, and ontogenetic, morphological, and behavioral differences affecting matters such as kin and mate recognition, infanticide, and sexual selection. These factors may have skewed the occurrence of interbreeding or the survival and reproduction of hybrids in a way that might at least partially explain the pattern of introgression.",2.095,99

It is generally stated that the correlation between brain size and body parameters becomes very small at the species level (Aboitiz, 1996), but this is not the case for Homo sapiens where there is a strong correlation between brain size and body size across racial groups that differ in body size. The control for body size across racial groups (and sexes) is rendered difficult because bodies do not just differ only in height and weight. Within groups different studies show weak and inconsistent brain size/body height correlations. A better understanding of brain size/body height relations must await better quality data and a better understanding of how exactly body parameters should be scaled between groups and sexes. We attribute the clear between-group and weak within-group correlations to the large variety of body sizes and body types in our species, a variety which is only equalled in selectively bred species of animals. At present, there is no meaningful basis for the comparison of brain sizes within and between racial groups and sexes.",2.477,389

In this study, the effects of this abundant modified nucleotide on the structure and stability of H69 were compared with those of uridine in double-stranded (stem) regions. These results were compared with previous hairpin (stem plus single-stranded loop) studies to understand the contributions of the loop sequences to H69 structure and stability. The role of a loop nucleotide substitution from an A in bacteria (position 1918 in Escherichia coli 23S rRNA) to a G in eukaryotes (position 3734 in H. sapiens 28S rRNA) was examined. Thermodynamic parameters for the duplex RNAs were obtained through UV melting studies, and differences in the modified and unmodified RNA structures were examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The overall folded structure of human H69 appears to be similar to the bacterial RNA, consistent with the idea that ribosome structure and function are highly conserved; however, our results reveal subtle differences in structure and stability between the bacterial and human H69 RNAs in both the stem and loop regions. These findings may be significant with respect to H69 as a potential drug target site.",2.385,1279

In many biochemical, pathological and pharmaceutical studies on understanding the function of proteins in biological processes, identification of ubiquitination sites is an important first step. However, experimental approaches for identifying ubiquitination sites are often expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming, partly due to the dynamics and reversibility of ubiquitination. In silico prediction of ubiquitination sites is potentially a useful strategy for whole proteome annotation. A number of bioinformatics approaches and tools have recently been developed for predicting protein ubiquitination sites. However, these tools have different methodologies, prediction algorithms, functionality and features, which complicate their utility and application. The purpose of this review is to aid users in selecting appropriate tools for specific analyses and circumstances. We first compared five popular webservers and standalone software options, assessing their performance on four up-to-date ubiquitination benchmark datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Arabidopsis thaliana. We then discussed and summarized these tools to guide users in choosing among the tools efficiently and rapidly. Finally, we assessed the importance of features of existing tools for ubiquitination site prediction, ranking them by performance. We also discussed the features that make noticeable contributions to species-specific ubiquitination site prediction.",9.617,824

This disease is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration, eventually leading to complete blindness. Autosomal dominant (adRP) has been associated with mutations in at least four ubiquitously expressed genes encoding pre-mRNA splicing factors-Prp3, Prp8, Prp31 and PAP1. Biological function of adRP-associated splicing factor genes and molecular mechanisms by which mutations in these genes cause cell-type specific photoreceptor degeneration in humans remain to be elucidated. To investigate the in vivo function of these adRP-associated splicing factor genes, we examined Drosophila in which expression of fly Prp31 homolog was down-regulated. Sequence analyses show that CG6876 is the likely candidate of Drosophila melanogaster Prp31 homolog (DmPrp31). Predicted peptide sequence for CG6876 shows 57% similarity to the Homo sapiens Prp31 protein (HsPrp31). Reduction of the endogenous Prp31 by RNAi-mediated knockdown specifically in the eye leads to reduction of eye size or complete absence of eyes with remarkable features of photoreceptor degeneration and recapitulates the bimodal expressivity of human Prp31 mutations in adRP patients. Such transgenic DmPrp31RNAi flies provide a useful tool for identifying genetic modifiers or interacting genes for Prp31. Expression of the human Prp31 in these animals leads to a partial rescue of the eye phenotype.

However, the intelligence or intellectual processes of humans are vastly superior to those achieved by all other species. The adult human brain is a highly complex organ weighing approximately 1500g, which accounts for only 2% of the total body weight but consumes an amount of energy equal to that required by all skeletal muscle at rest. Although the human brain displays a typical primate structure, it can be identified by its specific distinguishing features. The process of evolution and humanisation of the Homo sapiens brain resulted in a unique and distinct organ with the largest relative volume of any animal species. It also permitted structural reorganization of tissues and circuits in specific segments and regions. These steps explain the remarkable cognitive abilities of modern humans compared not only with other species in our genus, but also with older members of our own species. Brain evolution required the coexistence of two adaptation mechanisms. The first involves genetic changes that occur at the species level, and the second occurs at the individual level and involves changes in chromatin organisation or epigenetic changes. The genetic mechanisms include: a) genetic changes in coding regions that lead to changes in the sequence and activity of existing proteins; b) duplication and deletion of previously existing genes; c) changes in gene expression through changes in the regulatory sequences of different genes; and d) synthesis of non-coding RNAs. Lastly, this review describes some of the main documented chromosomal differences between humans and great apes. These differences have also contributed to the evolution and humanisation process of the H. sapiens brain.",0,593

Tooth variability and observer error.,[],American journal of physical anthropology,1986,"In order to test the feasibility of cementum annulations to estimate age in humans, observer error and tooth variability in cementum ring counts were evaluated in a sample of 42 mandibular canine and first premolar pairs. Additionally, two sectioning techniques were evaluated. Demineralized thin sections (7 micron) stained with hematoxylin are the preferred technique since their age related variance is greater than 75% for all tooth types examined. In contrast, less than 50% of the total variance was accounted for among individuals when mineralized sections (80 micron) stained with alizarin red were used. Intertooth variability in ring counts of demineralized sections was large between canines and premolars (43%). Premolars provide counts with lower interobserver error and are the preferred tooth. In an expanded sample (N = 51) of demineralized premolars, intraobserver and interobserver error accounted for 2% and 5% of the total variance, respectively. Evaluation of several experimental designs showed that increasing the number of slides per tooth has the greatest effect on reducing variance followed by increasing the number of observers. Increasing the number of observations has little effect. Cementum ring counts are measurable to a highly repeatable extent and provide a level of repeatability greater than that reported for the pubic symphysis and auricular surface aging techniques.",2.379,470

Insecticide-based vector control is an established and important way of preventing transmission of such infections. Currently used insecticides can efficiently control mosquito populations, but there are growing concerns about emerging resistance, off-target toxicity and their ability to alter ecosystems. A potential target for the development of insecticides with reduced off-target toxicity is the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Herein, we report cloning, baculoviral expression and functional characterization of the wild-type AChE genes (ace-1) from An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti, including a naturally occurring insecticide-resistant (G119S) mutant of An. gambiae. Using enzymatic digestion and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry we found that the secreted proteins were post-translationally modified. The Michaelis-Menten constants and turnover numbers of the mosquito enzymes were lower than those of the orthologous AChEs from Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. We also found that the G119S substitution reduced the turnover rate of substrates and the potency of selected covalent inhibitors. Furthermore, non-covalent inhibitors were less sensitive to the G119S substitution and differentiate the mosquito enzymes from corresponding vertebrate enzymes. Our findings indicate that it may be possible to develop selective non-covalent inhibitors that effectively target both the wild-type and insecticide resistant mutants of mosquito AChE.",3.234,906

Handedness is generally considered to be an evolutionary byproduct of selection for manual dexterity and augmented visuo-cognitive capabilities within the context of complex stone tool manufacture/use. Testing this hypothesis requires an understanding of when appreciable levels of right dominant behavior entered the fossil record. Because bone remodels in vivo, skeletal asymmetries are thought to reflect greater mechanical loading on the dominant side, but incomplete preservation of external morphology and ambiguities about past loading environments complicate interpretations. We test if internal trabecular bone is capable of providing additional information by analyzing the thumb of Homo sapiens and Pan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assess trabecular structure at the distal head and proximal base of paired (left/right) first metacarpals using micro-CT scans of Homo sapiens (n = 14) and Pan (n = 9). Throughout each epiphysis we quantify average and local bone volume fraction (BV/TV), degree of anisotropy (DA), and elastic modulus (E) to address bone volume patterning and directional asymmetry. RESULTS: We find a right directional asymmetry in H. sapiens consistent with population-level handedness, but also report a left directional asymmetry in Pan that may be the result of postural and/or locomotor loading. CONCLUSION: We conclude that trabecular bone is capable of detecting right/left directional asymmetry, but suggest coupling studies of internal structure with analyses of other skeletal elements and cortical bone prior to applications in the fossil record.",2.379,133

Aerobic endurance exercise could play an important role in the evolution of Homo sapiens, and oxygen was not important just for survival, but it was crucial to redox-mediated adaptation. The metabolic challenge during physical exercise results in an elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are important modulators of muscle contraction, antioxidant protection, and oxidative damage repair, which at moderate levels generate physiological responses. Several factors of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and SIRT1, are modulated by exercise-associated changes in the redox milieu. PGC-1alpha activation could result in decreased oxidative challenge, either by upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and/or by an increased number of mitochondria that allows lower levels of respiratory activity for the same degree of ATP generation. Endogenous thiol antioxidants glutathione and thioredoxin are modulated with high oxygen consumption and ROS generation during physical exercise, controlling cellular function through redox-sensitive signaling and protein-protein interactions. Endurance exercise-related angiogenesis, up to a significant degree, is regulated by ROS-mediated activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha. Moreover, the exercise-associated ROS production could be important to DNA methylation and post-translation modifications of histone residues, which create heritable adaptive conditions based on epigenetic features of chromosomes. Accumulating data indicate that exercise with moderate intensity has systemic and complex health-promoting effects, which undoubtedly involve regulation of redox homeostasis and signaling.",7.407,1156

Although several studies have been conducted on ape Rh blood group genes, the clear genome structures of the gene clusters remain unknown. Here, we determined the genome structure of the gene cluster of chimpanzee Rh genes by sequencing five BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) clones derived from chimpanzees. We characterized three complete loci (Patr_RHalpha, Patr_RHbeta, and Patr_RHgamma). In the Patr_RHbeta locus, a short version of the gene, which lacked the middle part containing exons 4-8, was observed. The Patr_RHalpha and Patr_RHbeta genes were located on the locations corresponding to Hosa_RHD and Hosa_RHCE, respectively, and Patr_RHgamma was in the immediate vicinity of Patr_RHbeta. Sequence comparisons revealed high sequence similarity between Patr_RHbeta and Hosa_RHCE, while the chimpanzee Rh gene closest to Hosa_RHD was not Patr_RHalpha but rather Patr_RHgamma. The results suggest that rearrangements and gene conversions frequently occurred between these genes and that the classic orthology/paralogy dichotomy no longer holds between human and chimpanzee Rh blood group genes.",4.229,681

Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records.",2.379,1545

Second, it established whether navigation patterns are associated with a broader set of spatial abilities in men than in women. Results showed that current male home ranges surpass female home ranges. Ranging was also positively correlated with achievement in tests of mental rotation, surface development, and location memory among men only, whereas it was associated with embedded figures scores in both sexes. Overall, these findings substantiate the adaptive role of several spatial sex differences in humans.",1.52,344

Studies regarding its emergence and distribution within the genus Homo show that handedness is present very early. The mode in which it was articulated and spread across the different species during the course of human evolution could provide information about our own cognitive capacities. Here we report the manual laterality attributed to eleven 49,000 old Neandertal individuals from El Sidron cave (Spain), through the study of instrumental or cultural striations on the anterior dentition. Our results show a predominant pattern addressed to right-handers. These results fit within the modern human handedness distribution pattern and provide indirect evidence for behavior and brain lateralization on Neandertals. They support the early establishment of handedness in our genus. Moreover, the individual identified as Juvenile 1 (6-8 years old at death), displays the same striation pattern as the adult Neandertals from the sample, and thereby the ontogenic development of manual laterality in that Neandertal population seems to be similar to that of living modern humans.",3.234,1089

Although it is clearly the best enzyme available, the sole use of trypsin rarely leads to complete sequence coverage, even for abundant proteins. It is commonly assumed that this is because many tryptic peptides are either too short or too long to be identified by RPLC-MS/MS. We show through in silico analysis that 20-30% of the total sequence of three proteomes (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens) is expected to be covered by Large post-Trypsin Peptides (LpTPs) with M(r) above 3000 Da. We then established size exclusion chromatography to fractionate complex yeast tryptic digests into pools of peptides based on size. We found that secondary digestion of LpTPs followed by LC-MS/MS analysis leads to a significant increase in identified proteins and a 32-50% relative increase in average sequence coverage compared to trypsin digestion alone. Application of the developed strategy to analyze the phosphoproteomes of S. pombe and of a human cell line identified a significant fraction of novel phosphosites. Overall our data indicate that specific targeting of LpTPs can complement standard bottom-up workflows to reveal a largely neglected portion of the proteome.",4.245,1556

MetAP carries out this cleavage with high precision, and Met is the only natural amino acid residue at the N terminus that is accepted, although type I and type II MetAPs use two different sets of residues to form the hydrophobic S1 site. Characteristics of the S1 binding pocket in type I MetAP were investigated by systematic mutation of each of the seven S1 residues in Escherichia coli MetAP type I (EcMetAP1) and human MetAP type I (HsMetAP1). We found that Tyr-65 and Trp-221 in EcMetAP1, as well as the corresponding residues Phe-197 and Trp-352 in HsMetAP1, were essential for the hydrolysis of a thiopeptolide substrate, Met-S-Gly-Phe. Mutation of Phe-191 to Ala in HsMetAP1 caused inactivity in contrast to the full activity of EcMetAP1(Y62A), which may suggest a subtle difference between the two type I enzymes. The more striking finding is that mutation of Cys-70 in EcMetAP1 or Cys-202 in HsMetAP1 opens up the S1 pocket. The thiopeptolides Leu-S-Gly-Phe and Phe-S-Gly-Phe, with previously unacceptable Leu or Phe as the N-terminal residue, became efficient substrates of EcMetAP1(C70A) and HsMetAP1(C202A). The relaxed specificity shown in these S1 site mutants for the N-terminal residues was confirmed by hydrolysis of peptide substrates and inhibition by reaction products. The structural features at the enzyme active site will be useful information for designing specific MetAP inhibitors for therapeutic applications.",0,489

RESULTS: Eighteen street rabies virus strains were identified, including 2 from homo sapiens, 5 from ferret badger, and 11 from dog. Similarities of N gene and N protein were calculated to be 89.7%-100.0% and 98.4%-100.0% respectively. Mutations occurred in N gene were almost non-sense mutations.

Differences and similarities between the hyoids of these species are characterized and used to interpret the morphology and affi nities of the Dikika A. afarensis, Kebara 2 Neanderthal, and other fossil hominin hyoid bones. Humans and African apes are found to have distinct hyoid morphologies. In humans the maximum width across the distal tips of the articulated greater horns is usually slightly greater than the maximum length (distal greater horn tip to most anterior point of the hyoid body in the midline). A different pattern is usually found in the African ape hyoids, which have much greater maximum lengths. In humans, the hyoid body is also much more anteroposteriorly shallow in proportion to its height and width, and this is true for all age classes. The Dikika australopithecine hyoid body proportions are chimpanzeelike. A discriminant function analysis, using a larger subadult sample from the three extant species than that reported by Alemseged et al. (2006), confirms this finding. The Kebara hyoid dimensions (body alone, and articulated body and greater horns) are almost all within the observed range for human hyoids. Discriminant functions clearly distinguish human from African ape hyoids and classify the Kebara 2 hyoid as human (confirming the finding of Arensburg et al. 1989). Our virtual dissection of a chimpanzee air sac system shows its subhyoid extension into the dorsal hyoid body. Following Alemseged et al. (2006), the expanded bulla characteristic of the African ape and australopithecine hyoid body is therefore interpreted as refl ecting the presence of such a laryngeal air sac extension. Its absence in the human, Neanderthal, and H. heidelbergensis (Atapuerca SH) hyoids implicates the loss of the laryngeal air sacs as a derived Neanderthal and modern human trait, which evolved no later than the middle Pleistocene. If, as has been argued by de Boer (2012), the loss of the air sac helped to enhance perceptual discrimination of speech sounds, then this derived hyoid morphology can be added to the list of fossil markers of the capacity for speech.",0.853,1034

In view of recent evidence, it is believed that common genetic risk factors mainly highly polymorphic neuroreceptors are being shared among neuropsychiatric disorders. MATERIALS & METHODS: We identified 162 neuroreceptors from the 639 known receptors in Homo sapiens and investigated 231,683 SNPs using 1000 Genomes Project data and evaluated their biological effect using in silico tools including RegulomeDB, SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and CAROL. Furthermore, data from the 1000 Genomes Project was utilized to retrieve minor allele frequency and calculate pairwise logartithm of the odds score among these SNPs for African, American, Asian and European populations separately as well as when combined together using Haploview v4.2. LRTag was used to identify tagSNPs in populations. RESULTS: A total of 52,381 (22.60%) SNPs were predicted as functionally important genetic variations. We identified sets of 603, 495, 450, 453 and 646 informative tagSNPs for African, American, Asian, European and combined populations, respectively. We propose construction of a 'neuroreceptor variants array' with these informative SNPs for future pharmacogenomic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: Such an approach might improve genotype-phenotype correlation across different populations and lead to identification of reliable genetic markers and novel drug targets. Integration of these SNPs in literature would further provide evidence relevant to underlying mechanisms of genetics based nosology, pathophysiology and development of new drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",3.218,997

In this study, we explored the extent to which commonly preserved mandibular corpus morphology can be used to: (i) discriminate among extant hominid taxa and (ii) support species designations among fossil specimens assigned to the genus Homo. In the first part of the study, discriminant analysis was used to test for significant differences in mandibular corpus shape at different taxonomic levels (genus, species and subspecies) among extant hominid taxa (i.e. Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo). In the second part of the study, we examined shape variation among fossil mandibles assigned to Homo (including H. habilis sensu stricto, H. rudolfensis, early African H. erectus/H. ergaster, late African H. erectus, Asian H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens). A novel randomization procedure designed for small samples (and using group 'distinctness values') was used to determine whether shape variation among the fossils is consistent with conventional taxonomy (or alternatively, whether a priori taxonomic groupings are completely random with respect to mandibular morphology). The randomization of 'distinctness values' was also used on the extant samples to assess the ability of the test to recognize known taxa. The discriminant analysis results demonstrated that, even for a relatively modest set of traditional mandibular corpus measurements, we can detect significant differences among extant hominids at the genus and species levels, and, in some cases, also at the subspecies level. Although the randomization of 'distinctness values' test is more conservative than discriminant analysis (based on comparisons with extant specimens), we were able to detect at least four distinct groups among the fossil specimens (i.e. H. sapiens, H. heidelbergensis, Asian H. erectus and a combined 'African Homo' group consisting of H. habilis sensu stricto, H. rudolfensis, early African H. erectus/H. ergaster and late African H. erectus). These four groups appear to be distinct at a level similar to, or greater than, that of modern hominid species. In addition, the mandibular corpora of H. neanderthalensis could be distinguished from those of 'African Homo', although not from those of H. sapiens, H. heidelbergensis, or the Asian H. erectus group. The results suggest that the features most commonly preserved on the hominin mandibular corpus have some taxonomic utility, although they are unlikely to be useful in generating a reliable alpha taxonomy for early African members of the genus Homo.",2.097,1268

 Series B, Biological sciences",2016,"Homo erectus was the first hominin to exhibit extensive range expansion. This extraordinary departure from Africa, especially into more temperate climates of Eurasia, has been variously related to technological, energetic and foraging shifts. The temporal and regional anatomical variation in H. erectus suggests that a high level of developmental plasticity, a key factor in the ability of H. sapiens to occupy a variety of habitats, may also have been present in H. erectus. Developmental plasticity, the ability to modify development in response to environmental conditions, results in differences in size, shape and dimorphism across populations that relate in part to levels of resource sufficiency and extrinsic mortality. These differences predict not only regional variations but also overall smaller adult sizes and lower levels of dimorphism in instances of resource scarcity and high predator load. We consider the metric variation in 35 human and non-human primate 'populations' from known environmental contexts and 14 time- and space-restricted paleodemes of H. erectus and other fossil Homo Human and non-human primates exhibit more similar patterns of variation than expected, with plasticity evident, but in differing patterns by sex across populations.

Results of these analyses are used to interpret the femoral morphology of three pre-Recent Homo juveniles--the H. erectus KNM-WT 15000 and the archaic H. sapiens La Ferrassie 6 and Teshik-Tash 1--as well as observed differences in postcranial morphology between adult Recent and earlier Homo (Ruff et al., 1993). Our findings indicate the following: (1) There are age-related changes in long-bone diaphyseal envelope sensitivity to increased mechanical loading, with the periosteal envelope more responsive prior to mid-adolescence, and the endosteal envelope more responsive thereafter. The periosteal expansion and endosteal contraction of the diaphysis documented earlier for adult pre-Recent Homo relative to Recent humans (Ruff et al., 1993) is thus consistent with a developmental response to increased mechanical loading applied throughout life. The relatively large medullary cavity in the 11-12-year-old KNM-WT 15000 femur is also consistent with this model. However, the two archaic H. sapiens juveniles show relatively small medullary cavities, possibly indicating a modified developmental pattern in this group.

A multivariate analysis in size-shape space shows that ontogenetic scaling contributes to the development of sexual dimorphism in all five taxa, but to a varying extent. In absolute as well as in relative terms P. pygmaeus shows the greatest allometric component, followed by G. gorilla. Homo is intermediate, while in Pan the non-allometric constituent part contributes a large fraction to the actual sexual dimorphism, most markedly in the pygmy chimpanzee. An eigendecomposition of the five vectors of sexual dimorphism reveals two dimensions independent of allometry.

The brain contains 600 g lipid/kg, with a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid profile containing approximately equal proportions of arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency at any stage of fetal and/or infant development can result in irreversible failure to accomplish specific components of brain growth. For the past fifteen million years, the East African Rift Valley has been a unique geological environment which contains many enormous freshwater lakes. Paleoanthropological evidence clearly indicates that hominids evolved in East Africa, and that early Homo inhabited the Rift Valley lake shores. Although earlier hominid species migrated to Eurasia, modern Homo sapiens is believed to have originated in Africa between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and subsequently migrated throughout the world. A shift in the hominid resource base towards more high-quality foods occurred approximately two million years ago; this was accompanied by an increase in relative brain size and a shift towards modern patterns of fetal and infant development. There is evidence for both meat and fish scavenging, although sophisticated tool industries and organized hunting had not yet developed. The earliest occurrences of modern H. sapiens and sophisticated tool technology are associated with aquatic resource bases. Tropical freshwater fish and shellfish have long-chain polyunsaturated lipid ratios more similar to that of the human brain than any other food source known. Consistent consumption of lacustrine foods could have provided a means of initiating and sustaining cerebral cortex growth without an attendant increase in body mass. A modest intake of fish and shellfish (6-12% total dietary energy intake) can provide more arachidonic acid and especially more docosahexaenoic acid than most diets contain today.

After completing an ongoing quantity discrimination task, subjects could request the hidden item by asking for it (children) or by pointing to the container and identifying the item on a symbol board (chimpanzees). Children and chimpanzees showed evidence of prospective-like memory in this task, as evidenced by successful retrieval of the item at the end of the task, sometimes spontaneously with no prompting from the experimenter.

Upon store depletion, the calcium sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, STIM1, activates Orai1, a CRAC channel in the plasma membrane. We have determined the structures of SOAR from Homo sapiens (hSOAR), which is part of STIM1 and is capable of constitutively activating Orai1, and the entire coiled coil region of STIM1 from Caenorhabditis elegans (ceSTIM1-CCR) in an inactive state. Our studies reveal that the formation of a SOAR dimer is necessary to activate the Orai1 channel. Mutations that disrupt SOAR dimerization or remove the cluster of positive residues abolish STIM1 activation of Orai1. We identified a possible inhibitory helix within the structure of ceSTIM1-CCR that tightly interacts with SOAR. Functional studies suggest that the inhibitory helix may keep the C-terminus of STIM1 in an inactive state. Our data allowed us to propose a model for STIM1 activation.",9.674,1332

The gut microbiota community is principally involved in the metabolism of dietary constituents such as carbohydrates which account for majority of the energy intake from diet. Diet has gained an important role in shaping the composition of gut inhabitants. The quantity and type of food consumed is recognized as a causal factor for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Analysis of host-microbe interactions can thus contribute to the understanding of such metabolic disorders. In this study, data from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Carbohydrate Active EnZYmes Database was utilized as a starting point. Enzyme information from the host Homo sapiens coupled with details of the three predominant phyla of gut bacteria, namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were used in the creation of a comprehensive metabolic network, which we refer to as 'meta-metabolome'. This 'meta-metabolome' provides a perspective of the degree to which microbes influence carbohydrate metabolism, in conjunction with host specific enzymes. Analysis of reactions in the network reveals the amplification of monosaccharide content brought about by microbial enzyme activity. The framework outlined in this study provides a holistic approach to assess host-microbe symbiosis. It also provides us with a means of analyzing how diet can be modulated to provide beneficial effects to the host or how probiotics can potentially be used to relieve certain metabolic disorders.",2.297,1229

Here, we provide complete phenotypic, molecular and functional characterization for NKp44 triggering receptor on Pan troglodytes NK cells, the closest human relative, and the analysis of NKp44-genomic locus and transcription in Macaca fascicularis. Similar to H. sapiens, NKp44 expression is detectable on chimpanzee NK cells only upon activation. However, basal NKp44 transcription is 5-fold higher in chimpanzees with lower differential increases upon cell activation compared with humans. Upon activation, an overall 12-fold lower NKp44 gene expression is observed in P. troglodytes compared with H. sapiens NK cells with only a slight reduction in NKp44 surface expression. Functional analysis of 'in vitro' activated purified NK cells confirms the NKp44 triggering potential compared with other major NCRs. These findings suggest the presence of a post-transcriptional regulation that evolved differently in H. sapiens. Analysis of cynomolgus NKp44-genomic sequence and transcription pattern showed very low levels of transcription with occurrence of out-of-frame transcripts and no surface expression. The present comparative analysis suggests that NKp44-genomic organization appears during macaque speciation, with considerable evolution of its transcriptional and post-transcriptional tuning. Thus, NKp44 may represent an NCR being only recently emerged during speciation, acquiring functional relevance only in non-human primates closest to H. sapiens.",2.536,1642

Much more recently, an agricultural technology from mainland Asia spread into the region, possibly in association with Austronesian languages. Using detailed genealogical study of Y chromosome variation, we show that the majority of current Austronesian speakers trace their paternal heritage to Pleistocene settlers in the region, as opposed to more-recent agricultural immigrants. A fraction of the paternal heritage, however, appears to be associated with more-recent immigrants from northern populations. We also show that the northern Neolithic component is very unevenly dispersed through the region, with a higher contribution in Southeast Asia and a nearly complete absence in Melanesia.

How did this scientific knowledge influence the correctness of quadruped walking depictions in the fine arts? Did the proportion of erroneous quadruped walking illustrations relative to their total number (i.e. error rate) decrease after Muybridge? How correctly have cavemen (upper palaeolithic Homo sapiens) illustrated the walking of their quadruped prey in prehistoric times? The aim of this work is to answer these questions. We have analyzed 1000 prehistoric and modern artistic quadruped walking depictions and determined whether they are correct or not in respect of the limb attitudes presented, assuming that the other aspects of depictions used to determine the animals gait are illustrated correctly. The error rate of modern pre-Muybridgean quadruped walking illustrations was 83.5%, much more than the error rate of 73.3% of mere chance. It decreased to 57.9% after 1887, that is in the post-Muybridgean period. Most surprisingly, the prehistoric quadruped walking depictions had the lowest error rate of 46.2%. All these differences were statistically significant.

Of particular interest are the two brain-expressed genes Protocadherin11XY (PCDH11XY) and the Synaptobrevin-like gene (SYBL1) which have been duplicated from the X chromosome to the Y chromosome to give X-Y homologous gene pairs that are specific to modern humans. We examined the DNA of KS individuals reported recently by DeLisi et al. 2005 and determined the parental origin of the X alleles, the degree of skewed X inactivation and investigated the CpG island methylation status of PCDH11XY and SYBL1 by bisulphite sequencing and quantification of methylated HpaII sites. We used a novel method for quantification of unmethylated CpGs with the restriction enzyme McrBC which cuts methylated but not unmethylated CpGs. The results showed that KS individuals have two methylated and one unmethylated SYBL1 allele whereas PCDH11XY is unmethylated and escapes X inactivation on the extra X chromosome. Overexpression of PCDH11XY in KS is probable and variable escape from inactivation of this Homo sapiens-specific gene could account for some abnormalities in KS.

Genetics offers the opportunity to objectively test taxonomies based on morphology and may be used to supplement conventional approaches to hominid systematics. Our analyses, examining chromosomes and 46 estimates of genetic distance, indicate there may have been only around 4 species on the direct line to modern humans and 5 species in total. This contrasts with current taxonomies recognising up to 23 species. The genetic proximity of humans and chimpanzees has been used to suggest these species are congeneric. Our analysis of genetic distances between them is consistent with this proposal. It is time that chimpanzees, living humans and all fossil humans be classified in Homo. The creation of new genera can no longer be a solution to the complexities of fossil morphologies. Published genetic distances between common chimpanzees and bonobos, along with evidence for interbreeding, suggest they should be assigned to a single species. The short distance between humans and chimpanzees also places a strict limit on the number of possible evolutionary 'side branches' that might be recognised on the human lineage. All fossil taxa were genetically very close to each other and likely to have been below congeneric genetic distances seen for many mammals. Our estimates of genetic divergence suggest that periods of around 2 million years are required to produce sufficient genetic distance to represent speciation. Therefore, Neanderthals and so-called H. erectus were genetically so close to contemporary H. sapiens they were unlikely to have been separate species. Thus, it is likely there was only one species of human (H. sapiens) for most of the last 2 million years. We estimate the divergence time of H. sapiens from 16 genetic distances to be around 1.7 Ma which is consistent with evidence for the earliest migration out of Africa.

Cranium, humerus, and os coxae of 60 skeletons (30 male, 30 female) from the Chiang Mai University Skeletal Collection were scanned by XRF and differences in elemental profiles between male and female bones determined using discriminant analysis. In the cranium, three elements (S, Ca, Pb) were significantly higher in males and five elements (Si, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ag) plus light elements (atomic number lower than 12) were higher in females. In humerus and os coxae, nine elements were significantly higher in male and one element was higher in female samples. The accuracy rate for sex estimation was 60, 63, and 61 % for cranium, humerus, and os coxae, respectively, and 67 % when data for all three bones were combined. We conclude that there are sex differences in bone elemental profiles; however, the accuracy of XRF analyses for discriminating between male and female samples was low compared to standard morphometric and molecular methods.

Strong positive reaction was seen in secretory granules of the stomach of C. auratus, while in R. ridibunda the antigens were expressed by single epithelial cells in cardial stomach glands.

Here, we identified a gene called LONO1 (LNO1) in Arabidopsis in which mutations can abolish the first asymmetrical cell division of the zygote, alter planes and number of cell divisions in early embryogenesis, and eventually arrest embryo development. LNO1 is highly expressed in anthers of flower buds, stigma papilla of open flowers, and embryo and endosperm during early embryogenesis, which is correlated with its functions in reproductive development. The homozygous lno1-1 seed is not viable. LNO1, a homolog of the nucleoporin NUP214 in human (Homo sapiens) and Nup159 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), encodes a nucleoporin protein containing phenylalanine-glycine repeats in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that LNO1 can functionally complement the defect in the yeast temperature-sensitive nucleoporin mutant nup159. We show that LNO1 specifically interacts with the Arabidopsis DEAD-box helicase/ATPase LOS4 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, mutations in AtGLE1, an Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast Gle1 involved in the same poly(A) mRNA export pathway as Nup159, also result in seed abortion. Our results suggest that LNO1 is a component of the nuclear pore complex required for mature mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which makes LNO1 essential for embryogenesis and seed viability in Arabidopsis.",6.841,1291

The cranium was found in a succession of fluvio-deltaic and lacustrine deposits and is associated with a rich mammalian fauna of early to early-middle Pleistocene age. A magnetostratigraphic survey indicates two reversed and two normal magnetozones.

So far there is no effective drug or vaccine available against Cp. Previously, a pan-genomic analysis was performed for both biovar equi and biovar ovis and a Pathogenicity Islands (PAIS) analysis within the strains highlighted a large set of proteins that could be relevant therapeutic targets for controlling the onset of CLA. In the present work, a structural druggability analysis pipeline was accomplished along 15 previously sequenced Cp strains from both biovar equi and biovar ovis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We computed the whole modelome of a reference strain Cp1002 (NCBI Accession: NC_017300.1) and then the homology models of proteins, of 14 different Cp strains, with high identity (>/= 85%) to the reference strain were also done. Druggability score of all proteins pockets was calculated and only those targets that have a highly druggable (HD) pocket in all strains were kept, a set of 58 proteins. Finally, this information was merged with the previous PAIS analysis giving two possible highly relevant targets to conduct drug discovery projects. Also, off-targeting information against host organisms, including Homo sapiens and a further analysis for protein essentiality provided a final set of 31 druggable, essential and non-host homologous targets, tabulated in table S4, additional file 1. Out of 31 globally druggable targets, 9 targets have already been reported in other pathogenic microorganisms, 3 of them (3-isopropylmalate dehydratase small subunit, 50S ribosomal protein L30, Chromosomal replication initiator protein DnaA) in C. pseudotuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Overall we provide valuable information of possible targets against C. pseudotuberculosis where some of these targets have already been reported in other microorganisms for drug discovery projects, also discarding targets that might be physiologically relevant but are not amenable for drug binding. We propose that the constructed in silico dataset might serve as a guidance for the scientific community to have a better understanding while selecting putative therapeutic protein candidates as druggable ones as effective measures against C. pseudotuberculosis.",3.986,836

We presented chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), orangutans (Pongo abelii), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and children (Homo sapiens) with a novel reward dispenser, the blicket detector. The detector was activated by inserting specific (yet randomly determined) objects, the so-called blickets. Once activated a reward was released, accompanied by lights and a short tone. Participants were shown different patterns of variation and covariation between two different objects and the activation of the detector. When subsequently choosing between one of the two objects to activate the detector on their own all species, except gorillas (who failed the training), took these patterns of correlation into account. In particular, apes and 2.5-year-old children ignored objects whose effect on the detector completely depended on the presence of another object. Follow-up experiments explored whether the apes and children were also able to re-evaluate evidence retrospectively. Only children (3-year-olds in particular) were able to make such retrospective inferences about causal structures from observing the effects of the experimenter's actions. Apes succeeded here only when they observed the effects of their own interventions. Together, this study provides evidence that apes, like young children, accurately infer causal structures from patterns of (co)variation and that they use this information to inform their own interventions.",3.479,612

We suggest that a human individual is now best described as a super-individual in which a large number of different species (including Homo sapiens) coexist. New concepts of biological individuality must extend beyond the traditional limitations of our own skin to include our resident microbes. Besides its important contributions to science, microbiome research raises philosophical questions that strike close to home. What is left of Homo sapiens?

Thus, both aging and aging-associated diseases can be viewed, at least in part, as the result of a developmental program that is activated early in embryogenesis and persists throughout the lifespan of the organism. We would expect this developmental program to be regulated by a set of interacting protein networks that connect environmental and molecular signals.

Prior work on heritable temperament and character traits is extended to account for the quantum-like and holographic properties (i.e. parts elicit wholes) of self-aware consciousness. Cladistic analysis is used to identify the succession of ancestors leading to human beings. The functional capacities that emerge along this lineage of ancestors are described. The ecological context in which each cladogenesis occurred is described to illustrate the shifting balance of evolution as a complex adaptive system. Comparative neuroanatomy is reviewed to identify the brain structures and networks that emerged coincident with the emergent brain functions. Individual differences in human temperament traits were well developed in the common ancestor shared by reptiles and humans. Neocortical development in mammals proceeded in five major transitions: from early reptiles to early mammals, early primates, simians, early Homo, and modern Homo sapiens. These transitions provide the foundation for human self-awareness related to sexuality, materiality, emotionality, intellectuality, and spirituality, respectively. The functional structure of human self-aware consciousness is concerned with the regulation of five planes of being: sexuality, materiality, emotionality, intellectuality, and spirituality. Each plane elaborates neocortical functions organized around one of the five special senses. The interactions among these five planes gives rise to a 5 x 5 matrix of subplanes, which are functions that coarsely describe the focus of neocortical regulation. Each of these 25 neocortical functions regulates each of five basic motives or drives that can be measured as temperaments or basic emotions related to fear, anger, disgust, surprise, and happiness/sadness. The resulting 5 x 5 x 5 matrix of human characteristics provides a general and testable model of the functional structure of human consciousness that includes personality, physicality, emotionality, cognition, and spirituality in a unified developmental framework.",0,1831

This study examined variation in trigonid crest patterns on the enamel and dentine surfaces to (1) evaluate the concordance between the morphology of trigonid crests at the inner dentine and the outer enamel surfaces; (2) examine their developmental origin(s); and (3) examine trait polarity through comparison with Australopithecus africanus and Pan. The sample included 73 H. neanderthalensis, 67 contemporary H. sapiens, 5 A. africanus, and 24 Pan lower molars. Results indicate general agreement in the morphology observed on the dentine and enamel surfaces. All but one H. neanderthalensis molar shows some trigonid crest development, whereas trigonid crests occur in low frequency in contemporary humans. Pan and A. africanus both also show high frequencies of a continuous trigonid crest. However, the origin of the trigonid crest differs among groups. H. neanderthalensis uniquely possesses a 'middle' trigonid crest that originates from the mesial accessory ridge of one or both cusps. Based on our results we suggest that presence of a continuous middle trigonid crest at the dentine surface is primitive and the lack of any trigonid crest is derived. Genetic drift may explain the high frequency of trigonid crests in H.neanderthalensis. However, H. neanderthalensis still appears to be derived relative to Pan and A. africanus in its high frequency of the mesial-mesial trigonid crestconfiguration.",2.379,1314

However, analysis and comparison of ossicles are complicated by their minute size and complex three-dimensional shapes. Here we introduce a geometric morphometric measurement protocol for 3D shape analysis based on landmarks and semilandmarks obtained from muCT images and apply it to ossicles of extant hominids (great apes and humans). We show that the protocol is reliable and reproducible over a range of voxel resolutions, and captures even subtle shape differences. Using this approach it is possible to distinguish the hominid taxa by mean shapes of their malleus and incus (p < 0.01). The stapes appears less diagnostic, although this may in part be related to the small sample size available. Using ancestral state estimation, we show that, within hominids, Homo sapiens is derived with respect to its malleus (short manubrium, long corpus, head anterior-posterior flattened, articular facet shape), incus (wide intercrural curvature, long incudal processes, articular facet shape) and stapes (high stapes with kidney-shaped footplate). H. sapiens also shows a number of plesiomorphic shape traits whereas Gorilla and Pan possess a number of autapomorphic characteristics. The Pongo ossicles appear to be close to the plesiomorphic hominid condition. The malleus shows little difference in size among hominids, and allometry is thus of little importance. In contrast, the incus and stapes are more variable in size, and their shape is more strongly related to size differences. Although the form-function relationships in the middle ear are not fully understood, some aspects of ossicle morphology suggest that interspecific differences in hearing capacities are present among hominids. Finally, the results of this study provide a comparative framework for morphometric studies analyzing ossicles of extinct hominids, with a bearing on taxonomy, phylogeny and auditory function.",3.733,561

METHODS: Vault images of 143 individuals from 0 to 31 years old were analyzed by thickness semiautomatic measurements. For each individual, we obtained a thickness mean measure (TMM) and its coefficient of variation, a measure of endocranial volume (EV), the distribution of relative frequencies of thickness-relative frequency polygon, and a topographic mapping that shows the thickness arrangement through a chromatic scale. Ontogenetic changes of these variables were evaluated by different regression models (TMM vs. age, EV vs. age, TMM vs. EV) and visual comparisons between the age groups. RESULTS: TMM increased during ontogeny until the onset of adulthood without sex differences, but the most accelerated growth rates occur during the first 6 years of postnatal life. TMM variations were associated with EV only in infants and children, but not in later periods. The polygons showed a flattening during ontogeny, probably due to an increase in thickness variation within individuals. However, the adult pattern of thickness arrangement, with the lateral region thinner than the regions near sagittal plane, was detected from infancy. CONCLUSION: The pattern of thickness arrangement is established early in ontogeny but CVT increases and changes in distribution until adolescence. Several factors may influence CVT, such as the brain, muscles, vessels, and sutures.",1.204,52

The phylogenetic tree results, derived through the Neighbour-Joining method using MEGA5.0, indicated a close genetic relationship between tree shrews, Homo sapiens, and Macaca mulatta. The three-dimensional structure analysis showed that the surface charges in most regions of tree shrew IL-2 were similar to between tree shrews and humans; however, the N-glycosylation sites and local structures were different, which may affect antibody binding.

Moreover, m(1)A in mRNA is reversible by ALKBH3, a known DNA/RNA demethylase. Lastly, we show that m(1)A methylation responds dynamically to stimuli, and we identify hundreds of stress-induced m(1)A sites.

If the responder accepts, both are paid. If not, neither is paid. Typically, responders reject inequitable distributions, favoring punishing over maximizing. In Jensen et al.'s (Science 318:107-109, 2007) adaptation with apes, a proposer selects between two distributions of raisins. Despite inequitable offers, responders often accept, thereby maximizing. The rejection response differs between the human and ape versions of this game. For humans, rejection is instantaneous; for apes, it requires 1 min of inaction. We replicate Jensen et al.'s procedure in humans with money. When waiting 1 min to reject, humans favor punishing over maximizing; however, when rejection requires 5 min of inaction, humans, like apes, maximize. If species differences in time horizons are accommodated, Jensen et al.'s ape data are reproducible in humans.",2.582,214

Exploring the deep roots of art from cognitive, neurological, genetic, evolutionary, archaeological, and biological perspectives is essential for the full understanding of why we have art, and what art is about. The cognitive basis of art is symbolic, abstract, and referential thinking. However, archaeological markers of symbolic activity by early humans are not associated with art production. There is an enormously large time gap between the activity and the appearance of sporadic art by early Homo sapiens, and another large time delay before appearance of enduring practice of art. The aesthetic aspect of art is not considered to be the initial impetus for creating it. Instead, archaeological markers suggest that the early beginnings of art are associated with development of stratified societies where external visual identifiers by way of body ornaments and decorations were used. The major contributing forces for the consistency in art-making are presumed to be the formation of socioculture, intragroup cooperation, increased group size, survival of skillful artisans, and favorable demographic conditions. The biological roots of art are hypothesized to parallel aspects of our ancestry, specifically animal courtship displays, where signals of health and genetic quality are exhibited for inspection by potential mates. Viewers assess displayed art for talent, skill, communicative, and aesthetic-related qualities. Interdisciplinary discussions of art reflect the current approach to full understanding of the nature of art.",2.833,781

Phylogenetic analysis utilizing the sequences of papain superfamily of C. sinensis demonstrated that cathepsin C and cathepsin Bs came from a common ancestry. Cathepsin C of C. sinensis (Cscathepsin C) was identified as an excretory/secretory product by Western blot analysis. The results of transcriptional level and translational level of Cscathepsin C at metacercaria stage were higher than that at adult worms. Immunolocalization analysis indicated that Cscathepsin C was specifically distributed in the suckers (oral sucker and ventral sucker), eggs, vitellarium, intestines, and testis of adult worms. In the metacercaria, it was mainly detected on the cyst wall and excretory bladder.

In some unknown way, genomic information specifies the development of P-cells. One of us (AJP) has previously proposed that fractal processes associated with DNA are in a causal relation to the fractal properties of organelles such as P-cells (FractoGene, 2002, patent pending). This fractal postulate predicts that the dendritic arborization of P-cells will be less complex in lower order vertebrates. The prediction can be tested by systematic comparative neuroanatomy of the P-cell in species for which genome sequences permit inter-species comparison. The Fugu rubripes (Fugu), Danio rerio (Danio) and other species are lower order vertebrates for which genome sequences are available and tests could be conducted. Consistent with the fractal prediction, P-cell dendritic arbor is primitive in Fugu, being much less complex than in Mus musculus and in Homo sapiens. Genomic analysis readily identified PEP19/Pcp4, Calbindin-D28k, and GAD67 genes in Fugu and in Danio that are closely associated with P-cells in Canis familiaris, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. Gene L7/Pcp2 exhibits strongest association with P-cells in higher vertebrates. L7/Pcp2 shows strong protein residue homology with genes greater than 600 residues and including 2-3 GoLoco domains, designated as having G protein signaling modulator function (AGS3-like proteins). Fugu has a short gene with a single GoLoco domain, but it has greatest homology with the AGS3-like proteins. No similar short gene is present in Danio or in Xenopus. Classical L7/Pcp2 is only detected in higher vertebrates, suggesting that it may be a marker of more recent evolutionary development of cerebellar P-cells.

Our results show a clear distinction between the morphology seen in earlier hominin taxa such as Australopithecus and African early Homo, as well as Asian H. erectus, and more recent groups such as European H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens. The morphology of the earlier hominins includes an asymmetrical outline, a conspicuous talonid, and an occlusal polygon that tends to be large. The morphology of the recent hominins includes a symmetrical outline and a reduced or absent talonid. Within this later group, premolars belonging to H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis tend to possess a small and mesiolingually-displaced occlusal polygon, whereas H. sapiens specimens usually present expanded and centered occlusal polygons in an almost circular outline. The morphological differences among Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and African early Homo as studied here are small and evolutionarily less significant compared to the differences between the earlier and later homin taxa.

Analyses indicate that UC 101 has consistent affinities with Easter Island and European populations, whereas UC 103 has more tenuous similarities with Australo-Melanesian groups. Both fossils exhibit some similarities to certain Paleoamerican and Archaic Indian individuals, but rarely cluster together. Upper Cave 103 is more of an outlier to modern populations than is UC 101.

They also confirm that this pattern applied in the arrival of modern cognition: the anatomically recognizable species Homo sapiens was well established long before any population of it began to show indications of behaving symbolically. This places the origin of symbolic thought in the realms of exaptation, whereby new structures come into existence before being recruited to new uses, and of emergence, whereby entire new levels of complexity are achieved through new combinations of attributes unremarkable in themselves. Both these phenomena involve entirely routine evolutionary processes; special as we human beings may consider ourselves, there was nothing special about the way we came into existence.

However, these treatments can only partially decrease the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia progression. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 are 5alpha-reductase inhibitor targets. We investigated the association between drug efficacy and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes in a Chinese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 11 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes in a total of 426 benign prostatic hyperplasia cases and 1,008 controls from Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Cases were treated with type II 5alpha-reductase inhibitors and alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists. We tested the association of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms with benign prostatic hyperplasia risk/progression, clinical characteristics at baseline, including the I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) and total prostate volume, and changes in clinical characteristics after treatment. RESULTS: The 11 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms were not significantly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia risk or progression (each p >0.05). In the SRD5A1 gene rs6884552 and rs3797177 were significantly associated with baseline I-PSS (p = 0.04 and 0.003, respectively). In the SRD5A2 gene rs523349 (V89L) and rs9332975 were significantly associated with baseline total prostate volume (p = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively).

In this study, we present a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of primate cranial morphology, providing a multivariate comparison of the major patterns of cranial shape change during primate evolution and quantitative assessments of cranial diversity among different clades. We digitized a set of 18 landmarks designed to capture overall cranial shape on male and female crania representing 66 genera of living primates. The landmark data were aligned using a Generalized Procrustes Analysis and then subjected to a principal components analysis to identify the major axes of cranial variation. Cranial diversity among clades was compared using multivariate measurements of variance. The first principal component axis reflects differences in cranial flexion, orbit size and orientation, and relative neurocranial volume. In general, it separates strepsirrhines from anthropoids. The second axis reflects differences in relative cranial height and snout length and primarily describes differences among anthropoids. Eulemur, Mandrillus, Pongo, and Homo are among the extremes in cranial shape. Anthropoids, catarrhines, and haplorhines show a higher variance than prosimians or strepsirrhines. Hominoids show the highest variance in cranial shape among extant primate clades, and much of this diversity is driven by the unique cranium of Homo sapiens.",2.379,1609

Unavailability of any effective vaccine and recent emergence of multi drug resistant strains of malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum continues to cause persistent deaths in the tropical and sub-tropical region. As a result, demands for new targets for more effective anti-malarial drugs are escalating. Transketolase is an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway; a novel pathway which is involved in energy generation and nucleic acid synthesis. Moreover, significant difference in homology between Plasmodium falciparum transketolase (Pftk) and human (Homo sapiens) transketolase makes it a suitable candidate for drug therapy. Our present study is aimed to predict the 3D structure of Plasmodium falciparum transketolase and design an inhibitor against it. RESULTS: The primary and secondary structural features of the protein is calculated by ProtParam and SOPMA respectively which revealed the protein is composed of 43.3 % alpha helix and 33.04 % random coils along with 15.62 % extended strands, 8.04 % beta turns. The three dimensional structure of the transketolase is constructed using homology modeling tool MODELLAR utilizing several available transketolase structures as templates. The structure is then subjected to deep optimization and validated by structure validation tools PROCHECK, VERIFY 3D, ERRAT, QMEAN. The predicted model scored 0.74 for global model reliability in PROCHECK analysis, which ensures the quality of the model. According to VERIFY 3D the predicted model scored 0.77 which determines good environmental profile along with ERRAT score of 78.313 which is below 95 % rejection limit. Protein-protein and residue-residue interaction networks are generated by STRING and RING server respectively. CASTp server was used to analyze active sites and His 109, Asn 108 and His 515 are found to be more positive site to dock the substrate, in addition molecular docking simulation with Autodock vina determined the estimated free energy of molecular binding was of -6.6 kcal/mol for most favorable binding of 6'-Methyl-Thiamin Diphosphate. CONCLUSION: This predicted structure of Pftk will serve first hand in the future development of effective Pftk inhibitors with potential anti-malarial activity. However, this is a preliminary study of designing an inhibitor against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7; the results await justification by in vitro and in vivo experimentations.",0,908

It is unclear the extent to which the skilled reaching movements of different species share common ancestry and so are homologous or evolved independently and so are analogous (homoplasy). Here hand shaping (the movements of the hand and digits) that occur as the hand is transported to the target, were examined using high-speed (1000 frames/s) video recording and kinematic measurement (Peak Motus) in the rat (Rattus norvegicus) and human (Homo sapiens). Ten movement similarities were identified from the point that the limb initiated transport towards the food item to the point that the food was grasped. The digits were closed and semi-flexed as the hand was lifted (released from a substrate) and supinated. They closed further as the hand was collected for aiming. They then extended as the hand was transported to the target and then opened in conjunction with pronation to orient the hand for grasping (manipulation). Finally the digits were flexed and closed for grasping. These movements occurred at approximately the same point of limb transport in both species even though the rat used a whole paw grasp and the humans used a pincer grasp. Bushbabies (Galago garnettii), titi monkeys (Callicebus brunneus), rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and the bonobo (Pan paniscus) displayed similar hand shaping in skilled reaching despite species differences in grasping movements.

Direct dating of the specimen using U-series ablation has provided a minimum age estimate of 66.7+/-1ka, making it the oldest known human fossil in the Philippines. Its morphological features, as well as size and shape characteristics, indicate that the Callao metatarsal definitely belongs to the genus Homo. Morphometric analysis of the Callao metatarsal indicates that it has a gracile structure, close to that observed in other small-bodied Homo sapiens. Interestingly, the Callao metatarsal also falls within the morphological and size ranges of Homo habilis and H. floresiensis. Identifying whether the metatarsal represents the earliest record of H. sapiens so far recorded anywhere east of Wallace's Line requires further archaeological research, but its presence on the isolated island of Luzon over 65,000 years ago further demonstrates the abilities of humans to make open ocean crossings in the Late Pleistocene.",3.733,1446

In addition, we test the extent to which one can use comparisons of cranial base angles in humans and non-human primates to predict vocal tract dimensions. Four internal cranial base angles and one external cranial base angle were measured in a longitudinal sample of Homo sapiens and a cross-sectional sample of Pan troglodytes. These data show that the processes of cranial base angulation differ substantially in these species. While the human cranial base flexes postnatally in a rapid growth trajectory that is complete by two years, the cranial base in P. troglodytes extends postnatally in a more prolonged skeletal growth trajectory. These comparisons also demonstrate that the rate of cranial base angulation is comparable for different measures, but that angles which incorporate different anterior cranial base measurements correlate poorly. We also examined ontogenetic relationships between internal and external cranial base angles and vocal tract growth in humans to test the hypothesis that cranial base angulation influences pharyngeal dimensions and can, therefore, be used to estimate vocal tract proportions in fossil hominids. Our results indicate that internal and external cranial base angles are independent of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the vocal tract. Instead, a combination of mandibular and palatal landmarks can be used to predict dimensions of the vocal tract in H. sapiens. The developmental contrasts in cranial base angulation between humans and non-human primates may have important implications for testing hypotheses about the relationship between cranial base flexion and other craniofacial dimensions in hominid evolution.",3.733,1835

Differential transcriptional regulation of these genes is believed to alter the balance between two p53-dependent cell fates: cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. A number of previously identified p53 cofactors covalently modify and alter the function of both the p53 protein and histone proteins. Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations in chromatin modifiers have been strongly implicated in cancer development; thus, we sought to identify novel chromatin regulatory proteins that affect p53-dependent transcription and the balance between the expression of pro-cell cycle arrest and proapoptotic genes. We utilized an siRNA library designed against predicted chromatin regulatory proteins, and identified known and novel chromatin-related factors that affect both global p53-dependent transcription and gene-specific regulators of p53 transcriptional activation. The results from this screen will serve as a comprehensive resource for those interested in further characterizing chromatin and epigenetic factors that regulate p53 transcription.",0,410

In this study, the molecular cloning, expression, and antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) activity of porcine IFN-lambda3 (poIFN-lambda3) were reported. The full-length poIFN-lambda3 cDNA sequence encoded 196 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide.

The phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences indicated that poIFN-lambda3 is located in the same branch as B. taurus and O. aries IFN-lambda3. The poIFN-lambda3 without a signal anchor sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant poIFN-lambda3 exhibited significant antiviral effects against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of poIFN-lambda3 on PEDV was observed under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-lambda3 (prior to PEDV infection). In addition, poIFN-lambda3 was able to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1 in Vero E6 cells. These data demonstrate that poIFN-lambda3 has antiviral activity against PEDV and may serve as a useful biotherapeutic candidate to inhibit PEDV or other viruses in swine.",1.576,629

In the current study, the performance of three adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; Experiment 1) and forty-four 3.5- and 5.5-year-old human children (Experiment 2) was assessed on a behavioral search paradigm designed to assess metacognition. Subjects either directly observed the baiting of a large reward into one cup among an array of four, or had the baiting occluded from their view. In half of the trials, subjects were also presented with an additional distinctive cup that was always visibly baited with a small reward. This cup allowed subjects the opportunity to escape from making a guess about the location of the bigger reward. All three chimpanzees and both age groups of children selected the escape cup more often when the baiting of the large reward was concealed, compared to when it was visible. This demonstrates that both species can selectively choose a guaranteed smaller reward when they do not know the location of a larger reward and provides insight into the development of metacognition.",2.582,61

METHODS: Seventy-eight patients underwent double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). Expression of hITF mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR). The hITF gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into vector pDEST32. The yeast cells cotransformed with pDEST32-hITF and the human jejunal cDNA library were plated in a selective SC-Leu-Trp-His-Ura medium. The subsequent screen was performed with chi-gal detection, and true-positive clones were sequenced and analyzed with bioinformatics. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was performed to confirm the binding of putative proteins to the hITF protein. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were diagnosed with Crohn's disease. We found that the expression of hITF mRNA is significantly increased in Crohn's disease compared to normal controls. A total of ten colonies were selected and sequenced. Among these, six colonies were Homo sapiens zinc finger protein 193 (ZNF193), three colonies were Homo sapiens Aldo-keto reductase family 1C 1 (AKR1C1), and one colony was of an unknown gene. A reverse two-hybrid experiment and Co-IP indicated that ZNF193 and AKR1C1 might interact with hITF. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of hITF mRNA is increased in Crohn's disease. ZNF193 and AKR1C1 are proteins that can interact with the hITF protein by a yeast two-hybrid system and Co-IP, hITF may contribute to the mucosal repair through this interaction.",2.613,1470

The enzyme undergoes an internal serinolysis reaction as a post-translational modification to generate the active site pyruvoyl group for the decarboxylation process. The crystal structures of AdoMetDC from Homo sapiens, Solanum tuberosum, Thermotoga maritima, and Aquifex aeolicus have been determined. Numerous crystal structures of human AdoMetDC and mutants have provided insights into the mechanism of autoprocessing, putrescine activation, substrate specificity, and inhibitor design to the enzyme. The comparison of the human and potato enzyme with the T. maritima and A. aeolicus enzymes supports the hypothesis that the eukaryotic enzymes evolved by gene duplication and fusion. The residues implicated in processing and activity are structurally conserved in all forms of the enzyme, suggesting a divergent evolution of AdoMetDC.",3.293,1827

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from 12 CP and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. Samples were trypically digested with trypsin, eluted using high-performance liquid chromatography, and fragmented using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MS/MS spectra were analysed using PILOT_PROTEIN to identify all unmodified proteins within the samples. RESULTS: Using the database derived from Homo sapiens taxonomy and all bacterial taxonomies, 432 human (120 new) and 30 bacterial proteins were identified. The human proteins, angiotensinogen, clusterin and thymidine phosphorylase were identified as biomarker candidates based on their high-scoring only in samples from periodontal health. Similarly, neutrophil defensin-1, carbonic anhydrase-1 and elongation factor-1 gamma were associated with CP. Candidate bacterial biomarkers include 33 kDa chaperonin, iron uptake protein A2 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (health-associated) and ribulose biphosphate carboxylase, a probable succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase, or DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (CP-associated). Most of these human and bacterial proteins have not been previously evaluated as biomarkers of periodontal conditions and require further investigation.

21056456,Patterns of differences in brain morphology in humans as compared to extant apes.,['Aldridge K'],Journal of human evolution,2011,"Although human evolution is characterized by a vast increase in brain size, it is not clear whether or not certain regions of the brain are enlarged disproportionately in humans, or how this enlargement relates to differences in overall neural morphology. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not there are specific suites of features that distinguish the morphology of the human brain from that of apes. The study sample consists of whole brain, in vivo magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) and five ape species (gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos). Twenty-nine 3D landmarks, including surface and internal features of the brain were located on 3D MRI reconstructions of each individual using MEASURE software. Landmark coordinate data were scaled for differences in size and analyzed using Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis (EDMA) to statistically compare the brains of each non-human ape species to the human sample. Results of analyses show both a pattern of brain morphology that is consistently different between all apes and humans, as well as patterns that differ among species. Further, both the consistent and species-specific patterns include cortical and subcortical features. The pattern that remains consistent across species indicates a morphological reorganization of 1) relationships between cortical and subcortical frontal structures, 2) expansion of the temporal lobe and location of the amygdala, and 3) expansion of the anterior parietal region. Additionally, results demonstrate that, although there is a pattern of morphology that uniquely defines the human brain, there are also patterns that uniquely differentiate human morphology from the morphology of each non-human ape species, indicating that reorganization of neural morphology occurred at the evolutionary divergence of each of these groups.",3.733,1471

By utilizing a 65-membered fluorogenic substrate library consisting of natural and unnatural amino acids we established detailed substrate preferences of each enzyme in the S1 pocket. Our results show that this pocket is highly conserved for all investigated MetAPs, very stringent for methionine, and that several unnatural amino acids with methionine-like characteristics were also well hydrolyzed by MetAPs.

Three-dimensional temporal bone shape was captured using 15 landmarks on ontogenetic series of specimens from seven modern human populations. Discriminant function analysis revealed that population-specific temporal bone morphology is evident early in ontogeny, with significant shape differences among many human populations apparent prior to the eruption of the first molar. As early as five years of age, temporal bone shape reflects population history and can be used to reliably sort populations, although those in closer geographic proximity and molecular affinity are more likely to be misclassified. The deviation of cold-adapted populations from this general pattern of congruence between temporal bone morphology and genetic distances, identified in previous work, was confirmed here in adult and subadult specimens, and was revealed to occur earlier in ontogeny than previously recognized. Significant differences exist between the ontogenetic trajectories of some pairs of populations, but not among others, and the angles of these trajectories do not reflect genetic relationships or final adult temporal bone size. Significant intrapopulation differences are evident early in ontogeny, with differences becoming amplified by divergent trajectories in some groups. These findings elucidate how the congruence between adult human temporal bone morphology and population history develops, and reveal that this pattern corresponds closely to that described previously for facial ontogeny.",3.733,93

Variations in size and shape of an endocast help to differentiate among fossil hominin species whereas endocranial asymmetries are related to behavior and cognitive function. Here we analyse variations of the surface of the frontal, parieto-temporal and occipital lobes among different species of Homo, including 39 fossil hominins, ten fossil anatomically modern Homo sapiens and 100 endocasts of extant modern humans. We also test for the possible asymmetries of these features in a large sample of modern humans and observe individual particularities in the fossil specimens. This study contributes important new information about the brain evolution in the genus Homo. Our results show that the general pattern of surface asymmetry for the different regional brain surfaces in fossil species of Homo does not seem to be different from the pattern described in a large sample of anatomically modern H. sapiens, i.e., the right hemisphere has a larger surface than the left, as do the right frontal, the right parieto-temporal and the left occipital lobes compared with the contra-lateral side. It also appears that Asian Homo erectus specimens are discriminated from all other samples of Homo, including African and Georgian specimens that are also sometimes included in that taxon. The Asian fossils show a significantly smaller relative size of the parietal and temporal lobes. Neandertals and anatomically modern H. sapiens, who share the largest endocranial volume of all hominins, show differences when considering the relative contribution of the frontal, parieto-temporal and occipital lobes. These results illustrate an original variation in the pattern of brain organization in hominins independent of variations in total size. The globularization of the brain and the enlargement of the parietal lobes could be considered derived features observed uniquely in anatomically modern H. sapiens.",3.733,209
10330333,Evolution of a HOXB6 intergenic region within the great apes and humans.,"['Deinard A', 'Kidd K']",Journal of human evolution,1999,"Data accumulated over the past decade from several loci suggest that nonhuman primates have a greater amount of intraspecific genetic variation relative to humans. In phylogenetic reconstructions among primates that are based on genetic data, therefore, it becomes essential to adequately sample the population(s) being analyzed. Inadequate sampling may not only underestimate variation within any given population, but such an underestimate may confound any phylogenetic or population-specific conclusions implied by the data. Here we present inter- and intraspecific data on the molecular evolution of an approximately 1.0 kb intergenic HOXB6 sequence among humans, common chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. To date, this study represents the most comprehensive investigation of a noncoding nuclear locus among the great apes and humans that examines the nature and amount of intraspecific variation in DNA sequences. Not only do these HOXB6 data continue to support earlier findings that Homo sapiens sapiens has less genetic variation than any great ape species (Ruano et al., 1992; Deinard & Kidd, 1995), but they strongly suggest that a high level of genetic polymorphism existed within the common ancestor of the African ape clade (Homo-Pan-Gorilla). Despite detecting two nucleotide substitutions linking Pan and Homo, we caution against concluding that the HOXB6 data definitively support a Homo-Pan clade to the exclusion of Gorilla. Rather, we believe that taking into consideration the level of genetic polymorphism that is likely to have existed within the common ancestor, the most prudent conclusion that can be made from all available data, including morphological, karyotypic and genetic data, may be that speciation among Homo-Pan-Gorilla is best represented by a",3.733,1593

In this study, we approach the problem by quantifying properties of internal bone architecture that may reflect different loading patterns in metatarsophalangeal joints in humans and great apes. High-resolution x-ray computed tomography data were collected for first and second metatarsal heads of Homo sapiens (n = 26), Pan paniscus (n = 17), Pan troglodytes (n = 19), Gorilla gorilla (n = 16), and Pongo pygmaeus (n = 20). Trabecular bone fabric structure was analyzed in three regions of each metatarsal head. While bone volume fraction did not significantly differentiate human and great ape trabecular bone structure, human metatarsal heads generally show significantly more anisotropic trabecular bone architectures, especially in the dorsal regions compared to the corresponding areas of the great ape metatarsal heads. The differences in anisotropy between humans and great apes support the hypothesis that trabecular architecture in the dorsal regions of the human metatarsals are indicative of a forefoot habitually used for propulsion during gait. This study provides a potential route for predicting forefoot function and gait in fossil hominins from metatarsal head trabecular bone architecture.",3.733,1659

As well as research into the dating and geographic extent of such dispersals, there is an increasing focus on the factors that may have been responsible for dispersal. The growing body of detailed regional palaeoclimatic data is invaluable in demonstrating the often close relationship between changes in prehistoric environments and the movements of hominin populations. The scenarios constructed from such data are often overly simplistic, however, concentrating on the dynamics of cyclical contraction and expansion during severe and ameliorated conditions respectively. This contribution proposes a two-stage hypothesis of hominin dispersal in which populations (1) accumulate high levels of climatic tolerance during highly variable climatic phases, and (2) express such heightened tolerance via dispersal in subsequent low-variability phases. Likely dispersal phases are thus proposed to occur during stable climatic phases that immediately follow phases of high climatic variability. Employing high resolution palaeoclimatic data from Lake Tana, Ethiopia, the hypothesis is examined in relation to the early dispersal of Homo sapiens out of East Africa and into the Levant. A dispersal phase is identified in the Lake Tana record between c. 112,550 and c. 96,975 years ago, a date bracket that accords well with the dating evidence for H. sapiens occupation at the sites of Qafzeh and Skhul. Results are discussed in relation to the complex pattern of H. sapiens dispersal out of East Africa, with particular attention paid to the implications of recent genetic chronologies for the origin of non-African modern humans.",3.733,212
26404388,Diversity of Endonuclease V: From DNA Repair to RNA Editing.,['Kuraoka I'],Biomolecules,2015,"Deamination of adenine occurs in DNA, RNA, and their precursors via a hydrolytic reaction and a nitrosative reaction. The generated deaminated products are potentially mutagenic because of their structural similarity to natural bases, which in turn leads to erroneous nucleotide pairing and subsequent disruption of cellular metabolism. Incorporation of deaminated precursors into the nucleic acid strand occurs during nucleotide synthesis by DNA and RNA polymerases or base modification by DNA- and/or RNA-editing enzymes during cellular functions. In such cases, removal of deaminated products from DNA and RNA by a nuclease might be required depending on the cellular function. One such enzyme, endonuclease V, recognizes deoxyinosine and cleaves 3' end of the damaged base in double-stranded DNA through an alternative excision repair mechanism in Escherichia coli, whereas in Homo sapiens, it recognizes and cleaves inosine in single-stranded RNA. However, to explore the role of endonuclease V in vivo, a detailed analysis of cell biology is required. Based on recent reports and developments on endonuclease V, we discuss the potential functions of endonuclease V in DNA repair and RNA metabolism.",1.727,720

This evidence directs our focus to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, when from 195-123ka the world was in a fluctuating but predominantly glacial stage, when much of Africa was cooler and drier, and when dated archaeological sites are rare. Previously we have shown that humans had expanded their diet to include marine resources by ~164ka (+/-12ka) at Pinnacle Point Cave 13B (PP13B) on the south coast of South Africa, perhaps as a response to these harsh environmental conditions. The associated material culture documents an early use and modification of pigment, likely for symbolic behavior, as well as the production of bladelet stone tool technology, and there is now intriguing evidence for heat treatment of lithics. PP13B also includes a later sequence of MIS 5 occupations that document an adaptation that increasingly focuses on coastal resources. A model is developed that suggests that the combined richness of the Cape Floral Region on the south coast of Africa, with its high diversity and density of geophyte plants and the rich coastal ecosystems of the associated Agulhas Current, combined to provide a stable set of carbohydrate and protein resources for early modern humans along the southern coast of South Africa during this crucial but environmentally harsh phase in the evolution of modern humans. Humans structured their mobility around the use of coastal resources and geophyte abundance and focused their occupation at the intersection of the geophyte rich Cape flora and coastline. The evidence for human occupation relative to the distance to the coastline over time at PP13B is consistent with this model.",3.733,1634

 : JASS / Istituto italiano di antropologia",2012,"The topic of this review is the evolution of the genus Homo, focusing on evolutionary transitions that occurred during the Early and Middle Pleistocene. Two crucial issues are addressed in particular: 1) the emergence in the Early Pleistocene of the archaic variant of Homo that might represent the last common ancestor before the emergence of at least two (more probably three) geographically distinct trajectories; and (2) the evolution of these derived lineages, ultimately leading to the allopatric speciations of the most encephalised species of Homo: H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. In this framework, the time window between 1.0 million years ago (Ma) and 500 thousand years ago (ka) is of crucial importance, since it is probable that a new kind of humanity emerged in this period and then spread across a wide area encompassing Africa and Eurasia. These humans are represented by a number of specimens that are included within the single, polymorphic, and widespread species H. heidelbergensis. It is suggested that, in the course of the Middle Pleistocene, this species diversified in a number of incipient species -or subspecies- geographically and phenotypically distinct from one another. The case-study furnished by the calvarium found near Ceprano, in Italy, is of great interest in this regard, since it displays the least derived morphology seen among the hypodigm of H. heidelbergensis, and may represent better than other specimens the ancestral morphotype (i.e., the stem subspecies) of this taxon.",2.095,779

For the screening of chemicals with a potential thyroid hormone and anti-thyroid hormone activities, we have established transient transactivation assay systems using thyroid hormone receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta) from three frog species (Xenopus laevis, Silurana tropicalis and Rana rugosa), a fish (Oryzias latipes), an alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and a human (Homo sapiens). In all species examined, similar transcriptional activities were found for triiodothyronine (T3 : 10(-11) M in TRalpha and 10(-10) M in TRbeta) and thyroxine (T4 : 10(-9) M in TRalpha and 10(-8) M in TRbeta). Analogs of thyroid hormone (3,5,3',-triiodothyroacetic acid and 3,3',5,5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid) exhibited weaker activity, requiring 10-fold higher concentrations for induction of activity when compared with T3 and T4 . These results provide support for the usefulness of in vitro screening assay systems as part of an approach to test chemicals for potential thyroid hormone receptor activity. In addition, we observed that T3 -stimulated transcriptional activity of the O. latipes TRalpha was inhibited by 10(-5) M tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). In contrast, TR antagonist activities on TRalpha were not encountered in other species, even with TBBPA concentrations at 10(-5) M. In vitro transactivation assay systems using TRs from various species can be used for the screening of chemicals with thyroid-receptor agonist and antagonist activities.

The 1,357 bp Prohibitin cDNA comprises a 105 bp 5' untranslated region, a 427 bp 3' untranslated region and a 825 bp open reading frame. Protein alignment substantiates that the Prohibitin has 70.2, 69.8, 70.5, 70.9, 72.4, 70.6 and 74.9% identity with its homologues in Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis, Drosophila mojavensis and Aedes aegypti, respectively. In situ hybridization revealed that the Prohibitin mRNA was mainly localized around the proacrosomal vesicle and nucleus membrane in early-stage spermatid. In the following middle stage, Prohibitin mRNA was situated inside the invaginated region of half-moon-like nucleus and surrounded the proacrosomal vesicle. In late-stage spermatid, the mRNA was aggregated in the acrosomal tubule, the band between the acrosome and cup-like nucleus, remanent cytoplasm as well. In the mature sperm, mRNA was only found in the acrosomal tubule and the limited space between the nucleus and acrosome.

14672286,The critical role played by animal source foods in human (Homo) evolution.,['Milton K'],The Journal of nutrition,2003,"Wild primates take most of the daily diet from plant sources, eating moderate to small amounts of animal source foods (ASF). Plant materials make up from 87% to >99% of the annual diet of great apes, the closest living relatives of modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens). Reflecting their close genetic relationship, gut form and nutrient requirements of apes and humans (Hominoidea) are very similar, as is their pattern of digestive kinetics-one predicated on a relatively slow turnover of ingesta. In plant-eating mammals, in contrast to carnivorous mammals, greater body size is associated with lower dietary quality. Turning to ASF as a routine rather than occasional dietary component would have permitted the evolving human lineage to evade the nutritional constraints placed on body size increases in apes. Without routine access to ASF, it is highly unlikely that evolving humans could have achieved their unusually large and complex brain while simultaneously continuing their evolutionary trajectory as large, active and highly social primates. As human evolution progressed, young children in particular, with their rapidly expanding large brain and high metabolic and nutritional demands relative to adults would have benefited from volumetrically concentrated, high quality foods such as meat. Today, many humans, particularly those in high income nations, have a variety of high quality, non-ASF dietary alternatives, but such foods were not generally available to paleolithic human ancestors nor to many people today in low income nations.",0,1325

As we face the global challenges of the twenty-first century, they are also facets upon which we must become increasingly reliant. But what makes Homo sapiens so innovative and where does our high innovation propensity come from? Comparative research on innovativeness in non-human animals allows us to peer back through evolutionary time and investigate the ecological factors that drove the evolution of innovativeness, whereas experimental research identifies and manipulates underpinning creative processes. In commenting on the present theme issue, I highlight the controversies that have typified this research field and show how a paradigmatic shift in our thinking about innovativeness will contribute to resolving these tensions. In the past decade, innovativeness has been considered by many as a trait, a direct product of cognition, and a direct target of selection. The evidence I review here suggests that innovativeness will be hereon viewed as one component, or even an emergent property of a larger array of traits, which have evolved to deal with environmental variation.

Structured elements in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are known to control expression. The importance of unstructured regions adopting multiple conformations, however, is still poorly understood. High-resolution SHAPE-directed Boltzmann suboptimal sampling of the Homo sapiens Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) 5' UTR yields three distinct conformations compatible with the experimental data. Private single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified in two patients with retinoblastoma each collapse the structural ensemble to a single but distinct well-defined conformation. The RB1 5' UTRs from Bos taurus (cow) and Trichechus manatus latirostris (manatee) are divergent in sequence from H. sapiens (human) yet maintain structural compatibility with high-probability base pairs. SHAPE chemical probing of the cow and manatee RB1 5' UTRs reveals that they also adopt multiple conformations. Luciferase reporter assays reveal that 5' UTR mutations alter RB1 expression. In a traditional model of disease, causative SNVs disrupt a key structural element in the RNA. For the subset of patients with heritable retinoblastoma-associated SNVs in the RB1 5' UTR, the absence of multiple structures is likely causative of the cancer. Our data therefore suggest that selective pressure will favor multiple conformations in eukaryotic UTRs to regulate expression.",0,587

The morphology of their symphyses and corpora has been described as sharing similarities with both australopiths and early Homo despite their Late Pleistocene age. Although detailed morphological comparisons of these mandibles with those of modern and fossil hominin taxa have been made, a functional analysis in the context of masticatory biomechanics has yet to be performed. Utilizing data on cortical bone geometry from computed tomography scans, we compare the mechanical attributes of the LB1 and LB6 mandibles with samples of modern Homo, Pan, Pongo, and Gorilla, as well as fossil samples of Paranthropus robustus, Australopithecus africanus and South African early Homo. Structural stiffness measures were derived from the geometric data to provide relative measures of mandibular corpus strength under hypothesized masticatory loading regimes. These mechanical variables were evaluated relative to bone area, mandibular length and estimates of body size to assess their functional affinities and to test the hypothesis that the Liang Bua mandibles can be described as scaled-down variants of either early hominins or modern humans. Relative to modern hominoids, the H. floresiensis material appears to be relatively strong in terms of rigidity in torsion and transverse bending, but is relatively weak under parasagittal bending. Thus, they are 'robust' relative to modern humans (and comparable with australopiths) under some loads but not others. Neither LB1 nor LB6 can be described simply as 'miniaturized' versions of modern human jaws since mandible length is more or less equivalent in Homo sapiens and H. floresiensis. The mechanical attributes of the Liang Bua mandibles are consistent with previous inferences that masticatory loads were reduced relative to australopiths but remained elevated relative to modern Homo.",3.733,179

One factor that appears to contribute to longevity and fertility in humans, as well as to cancer-free survival, is the transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53, controlled by its main negative regulator MDM2. However, p53 and MDM2 homologs are found throughout the metazoan kingdom from Trichoplacidae to Hominidae. Therefore the question arises, if p53/MDM2 contributes to the shaping of primate features, then through which mechanisms. Previous findings have indicated that the appearances of novel p53-regulated genes and wild-type p53 variants during primate evolution are important in this context. Here, we report on another mechanism of potential relevance. Human endogenous retrovirus K subgroup HML-2 (HERV-K(HML-2)) type 1 proviral sequences were formed in the genomes of the predecessors of contemporary Hominoidea and can be identified in the genomes of Nomascus leucogenys (gibbon) up to Homo sapiens. We previously reported on an alternative splicing event in HERV-K(HML-2) type 1 proviruses that can give rise to nuclear protein of 9 kDa (Np9). We document here the evolution of Np9-coding capacity in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and show that the C-terminal half of Np9 binds directly to MDM2, through a domain of MDM2 that is known to be contacted by various cellular proteins in response to stress. Np9 can inhibit the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 in the cell nucleus, and can support the transactivation of genes by p53. Our findings point to the possibility that endogenous retrovirus protein Np9 contributes to the regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway specifically in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas.",0,809

Due to spread in areas that suffer from environmental stress, it has a large number of tolerance genes to environmental stress such as drought and salinity. Proline is one of the most compatible solutes that accumulate widely in plants to tolerate unfavorable environmental conditions. Plant proline synthesis depends on Delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) gene. But information about this gene in C. procera is unavailable. In this study, we uncovered and characterized P5CS (P5CS, NCBI accession no.

Strains of this parasite possess a significant amount of genetic variability and hence can be divided into at least six discrete typing units (DTUs). The life cycle of this protist suggests that multiclonal infections may emerge due to the likelihood of contact of triatomine insects with more than 100 mammal species. To date, there have been a few studies on but no consensus regarding standardised methodologies to identify multiclonal infections caused by this parasite. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a limiting dilution assay (LDA) to identify multiclonal infections in T. cruzi populations by comparing the feasibility and reliability of this method with the widely applied solid phase blood agar (SPBA) methodology. We cloned reference strains belonging to three independent genotypes (TcI, TcII, and TcIV) and mixed infections (TcI+TcII) using LDA and SPBA; the comparison was conducted by calculating the feasibility and reliability of the methods employed. Additionally, we implemented LDA in strains recently isolated from Homo sapiens, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma venosa, Panstrongylus geniculatus, Tamandua tetradactyla, Rattus rattus, Didelphis marsupialis and Dasypus novemcinctus, with the aim of resolving multiclonal infections using molecular characterization employing SL-IR (spliced leader intergenic region of mini-exon gene), the 24Salpha rDNA gene and microsatellite loci. The results reported herein demonstrate that LDA is an optimal methodology to distinguish T. cruzi subpopulations based on microsatellite markers by showing the absence of multiple peaks within a single locus.

There are two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Class I usually exists as a monomeric or dimeric form and has two highly conserved sequence motifs. Functionally, it aminoacylates at the 2'-OH of an adenosine nucleotide. While, class II normally exists as a dimeric or tetrameric form and consists of three highly conserved sequence motifs. It aminoacylates at the 3'-OH of the same adenosine. Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) belongs to class II aaRSs, is not only important to sustain the mechanism of protein fidelity by specifically recognizing its cognate amino acid; but also equally significant in the aminoacylation of tRNA(Asp). Several crystal structures of AspRS have been reported yet but no structural information is available for mammalian AspRS.

When they are understood, the result may be a paradigm shift in evolutionary anthropology. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: This paper reviews the evidence for reticulated evolution in the non-human primates and human lineage. Then it makes the case for extrapolating this sort of patterning to Homo sapiens and other hominins and explores the implications this would have for research design, method and understandings of evolution in anthropology. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Reticulation was significant in human evolutionary history and continues to influence societies today. Anthropologists and human scientists-whether working on ancient or modern populations-thus need to consider the implications of non-hierarchic evolution, particularly where molecular clocks, mathematical models and simplifying assumptions about evolutionary processes are used. This is not just a problem for palaeoanthropology. The simple fact of different mating systems among modern human groups, for example, may demand that more attention is paid to the potential for complexity in human genetic and cultural histories.",1.273,575

In this study, the statistical difference of information content was investigated in nucleosome and linker DNA regions across eukaryotic organisms. By analyzing the information redundancy, D k , in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, the short-range dominance of nucleotide correlation in nucleosome and linker DNA regions was confirmed. Significant difference of the D k value between the nucleosome and linker DNA regions was also found. The underlying reason for many successful oligonucleotide-based predictions of nucleosome positioning in eukaryotic model organisms may be attributed to the short-range dominance of nucleotide correlation in the nucleosome and linker DNA regions. When applying power spectrum analysis to the nucleosome and linker DNA regions, some obvious differences in sequence periodic signals were observed. The parameter F k was introduced to describe particular base correlation. Furthermore, the support vector machine combining F k was used to classify nucleosome and linker DNA regions in Homo sapiens, Oryzias latipes, C. elegans, Candida albicans, and S. cerevisiae. Independent test demonstrated that a good performance can be achieved by using this algorithm.

This finding supports the idea that the genetic code developed in response to direct binding interactions between amino acids and appropriate nucleobases, but also suggests that present-day mRNAs and their cognate proteins may be physicochemically complementary to each other and bind. Here, we computationally recode complete Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens mRNA transcriptomes and analyze how much complementary matching of synonymous mRNAs can vary, while keeping protein sequences fixed. We show that for most proteins there exist cognate mRNAs that improve, but also significantly worsen the level of native matching (e.g. by 1.8 viz. 7.6 standard deviations on average for H. sapiens, respectively), with the least malleable proteins in this sense being strongly enriched in nuclear localization and DNA-binding functions. Even so, we show that the majority of recodings for most proteins result in pronounced complementarity.

Of particular relevance are methods, such as enrichment analysis, that quantify the importance of ontology classes relative to a collection of domain data. Current analytical techniques, however, remain limited in their ability to handle many important types of structural complexity encountered in real biological systems including class overlaps, continuously valued data, inter-instance relationships, non-hierarchical relationships between classes, semantic distance and sparse data. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe a methodology called Markov Chain Ontology Analysis (MCOA) and illustrate its use through a MCOA-based enrichment analysis application based on a generative model of gene activation. MCOA models the classes in an ontology, the instances from an associated dataset and all directional inter-class, class-to-instance and inter-instance relationships as a single finite ergodic Markov chain. The adjusted transition probability matrix for this Markov chain enables the calculation of eigenvector values that quantify the importance of each ontology class relative to other classes and the associated data set members. On both controlled Gene Ontology (GO) data sets created with Escherichia coli, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens annotations and real gene expression data extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the MCOA enrichment analysis approach provides the best performance of comparable state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSION: A methodology based on Markov chain models and network analytic metrics can help detect the relevant signal within large, highly interdependent and noisy data sets and, for applications such as enrichment analysis, has been shown to generate superior performance on both real and simulated data relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",2.576,1368

Inadequate sample size, too far-reaching conclusions and neglect of other possible explanations are among the problems easily recognised in the literature. Many assumptions are lacking a sound experimental basis, and it becomes increasingly evident that there are many more problems and limits of interpretations than have been usually acknowledged in the recent past. It also appears that many results, which have been interpreted in terms of sexual division of labour may, in fact, be expressions of the intrinsic sexual dimorphism of Homo sapiens and not culture- or population-specific peculiarities. Acknowledging the results of many studies from the field of sports medicine it appears doubtful that adult patterns of activity can truly be isolated from those which stem from the formative years of the human skeleton during the subadult growth period.

In the present study, using data from the published genomic for Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis), we investigated a gene encoding nitric oxide synthase-interacting protein (NOSIP) of C. sinensis. Recombinant CsNOSIP (rCsNOSIP) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21. The open reading frame of CsNOSIP comprises 867 bp which encodes 289 amino acids and shares 72.9, 45.2, 47, 46.4, and 45.8% identity with NOSIP from Schistosoma mansoni, Xenopus laevis, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the full-length sequence contains an eNOS-interacting domain and numerous B-cell epitopes. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that CsNOSIP differentially transcribed throughout the adult worms, metacercariae, and egg stages of C. sinensis, and were highly expressed in the adult worms. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that the rCsNOSIP could be detected by the serum from BALB/c mice infected with C. sinensis and the serum from BALB/c mice immunized with excretory/secretory products (ESPs). Furthermore, immunolocalization assay showed that CsNOSIP was specifically localized in the intestine, vitellarium, and eggs of adult worm. Both immunoblot and immunolocalization results demonstrated that CsNOSIP was one component of ESPs of C. sinensis, which could be supported by SignalP analysis. Moreover, analysis of the antibody subclass and cytokine profile demonstrated that subcutaneously immunized BALB/c mice with rCsNOSIP could significantly enhance serum IgG1 level and up-regulate expression of IL-4 and IL-6 in the splenocytes. Our results suggested that CsNOSIP was an important antigen exposed to host immune system and probably involved in immune regulation of host by inducing Th2-polarized immune response.",2.098,1023

In contrast to all other cryptochromes, purified recombinant HsCRY1 protein was stably isolated in the anionic radical flavin state, containing only a small proportion of oxidized flavin which could be reduced by illumination. We conclude that animal Type I and Type II cryptochromes may both have signaling mechanisms involving formation of a flavin radical signaling state, and that light independent activity of Type II cryptochromes is a consequence of dark accumulation of this redox form in vivo rather than of a fundamental difference in signaling mechanism.",3.234,1395

It turned out, that with increasing number of offspring the depression score decreased. Childless women exhibited the highest prevalence of mild depression and the highest mean depression score. These association patterns between reproductive history and depressive disorders during old age were discussed by means of Darwinian psychiatry. A low number of offspring or childlessness and a lack of social networks for support are new in the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens.

Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the MDR pathogens notorious for its widespread infection around the world. The high resistance acquired by MRSA needs a serious concern and efforts should be carried out for the discovery of better therapeutics. With this aim, we designed a comparison of the metabolic pathways of the pathogen, MRSA strain 252 (MRSA252) with the human host (i.e., Homo sapiens) by using well-established in silico methods. We identified several metabolic pathways unique to MRSA (i.e., absent in the human host). Furthermore, a subtractive genomics analysis approach was applied for retrieval of proteins only from the unique metabolic pathways. Subsequently, proteins of unique MRSA pathways were compared with the host proteins. As a result, we have shortlisted few unique and essential proteins that could act as drug targets against MRSA. We further assessed the druggability potential of the shortlisted targets by comparing them with the DrugBank Database (DBD). The identified drug targets could be useful for an effective drug discovery phase. We also searched the sequences of unique as well as essential enzymes from MRSA in Protein Data Bank (PDB). We shortlisted at least 12 enzymes for which there was no corresponding deposition in PDB, reflecting that their crystal structures are yet to be solved! We selected Glutamate synthase out of those 12 enzymes owing to its participation in significant metabolic pathways of the pathogen e.g., Alanine, Aspartate, Glutamate and Nitrogen metabolism and its evident suitability as drug target among other MDR bacteria e.g., Mycobacteria. Due to the unavailability of any crystal structure of Glutamate synthase in PDB, we generated the 3D structure by homology modeling. The modeled structure was validated by multiple analysis tools. The active site of Glutamate synthase was identified by not only superimposing the template structure (PDB ID: 1E0A) over each other but also by the Parallel-ProBiS algorithm. The identified active site was further validated by cross-docking the co-crystallized ligand (2-oxoglutaric acid; AKG) of PDB ID: 1LLW.

Orangutans, chimpanzees, and 2.5-year-old human children also took into account experimenter actions toward third parties in forming reputations. These studies show that the human ability to form direct and indirect reputation judgment is already present in young children and shared with at least some of the other great apes.",1.52,113
21167323,"Structure, mechanism, and substrate specificity of kynureninase.",['Phillips RS'],Biochimica et biophysica acta,2011,"The kynurenine pathway is the major route for tryptophan catabolism in animals and some fungi and bacteria. The procaryotic enzyme preferentially reacts with l-kynurenine, while eucaryotic kynureninases exhibit higher activity with 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine. Crystallography of kynureninases from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfKyn) and Homo sapiens (HsKyn) shows that the active sites are nearly identical, except that His-102, Asn-333, and Ser-332 in HsKyn are replaced by Trp-64, Thr-282, and Gly-281 in PfKyn. Site-directed mutagenesis of HsKyn shows that these residues are, at least in part, responsible for the differences in substrate specificity since the H102W/S332G/N333T triple mutant shows activity with kynurenine but not 3-hydroxykynurenine. PfKyn is strongly inhibited by analogs of a proposed gem-diolate intermediate, dihydrokynurenine, and S-(2-aminophenyl)-l-cysteine S,S-dioxide, with K(i) values in the low nanomolar range. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments show that a transient quinonoid intermediate is formed on mixing, which decays to a ketimine at 740 s(-1). Quench experiments show that anthranilate, the first product, is formed in a stoichiometric burst at 50 s(-1) and thus the rate-determining step in the steady-state is the release of the second product, l-Ala. beta-Benzoylalanine is also a good substrate for PfKyn but does not show a burst of benzoate formation, indicating that the rate-determining step for this substrate is benzoate release. A Hammett plot of rate constants for substituted beta-benzoylalanines is non-linear, suggesting that carbonyl hydration is rate-determining for electron-donating groups, but C(beta)-C(gamma) cleavage is rate-determining for electron-withdrawing groups.

While all taxa of hominoids show asymmetries to various degrees, the patterns or combinations of petalial asymmetries are very different, with fossil hominoids and modern Homo sapiens showing an identical pattern of left-occipital, right-frontal petalias, which contrasts with those found normally in pongids. Of the pongids, Gorilla shows the greater degree of asymmetry in left-occipital petalias. Only modern Homo and hominoids (Australopithecus, Homo erectus, Neandertals) show a distinct left-occipital, right-frontal petalial pattern. Analysis by chi 2 statistics shows the differences to be highly significant. Due to small sample size and incompleteness of endocasts, small-brained hominoids, i.e., Australopithecus, are problematical. To the degree that gross petalial patterns are correlated with cognitive task specialization, we speculate that human cognitive patterns evolved early in hominoid evolution and were related to selection pressures operating on both symbolic and spatiovisual integration, and that these faculties are corroborated in the archeological record.",2.379,1858

In Pan troglodytes and Pan gorilla, as in Homo sapiens, the supinator muscle is the prime supinator, with the biceps brachii muscle serving to augment speed or force of supination. Primary of the pronator quadratus muscle over the pronator teres muscle during pronation is less clear in the African apes than in humans. Possibly, pongid radial curvature or forelimb elongation or both factors are related to the somewhat different patterns of activity that we observed in the pronator muscles of Pan versus those reported for Homo sapiens. In Pongo pygmaeus, as in P. troglodytes and P. gorilla, the pronator quadratus muscle acts as a pronator and the supinator muscle acts to supinate the hand at the radioulnar joints. The biceps brachii muscle is active at low levels as the orangutan supinates its hand with the elbow flexed.",2.379,1793

By 20,000 BP, our species had effectively colonized the entire Old World, and by 12,000 BP H. sapiens had a global distribution. We propose that this rapid migration into new habitats selected for individuals with low reactivity to novel stressors. Certain dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) polymorphisms are associated with low neuronal reactivity and increased exploratory behavior, novelty seeking, and risk taking, collectively considered novelty-seeking trait (NS). One previous report (Chen et al.: Evol Hum Behav 20 (1999) 309-324) demonstrated a correlation between migratory distance and the seven-repeat (7R) VNTR DRD4 allele at exon 3 for human populations. This study, however, failed to account for neutral genetic processes (drift and admixture) that might create such a correlation in the absence of natural selection. Furthermore, additional loci surrounding DRD4 are now recognized to influence NS. Herein we account for neutral genetic structure by modeling the nonindependence of neutral allele frequencies between human populations. We retest the DRD4 exon 3 alleles, and also test two other loci near DRD4 that are associated with NS. We conclude there is an association between migratory distance and DRD4 exon 3 2R and 7R alleles that cannot be accounted for by neutral genetic processes alone.",2.379,1424

The increasingly detailed understanding that contemporary science has acquired relating to active transport, however, has yet to lead to the design and construction of artificial molecular motors capable of employing ratchet-driven motions that can also perform work against concentration gradients.

This was initiated by using previously known miRNA sequences from Homo sapiens (human) and Mus musculus (mouse) to blast the databases of Sus scrofa (pig) EST. A total of 65 new miRNAs were detected following a range of filtering criteria. Using these new potential miRNA sequences, we further obtained the publicly available porcine mRNA database from NCBI and detected 48 586 potential target hits using a software RNA hybrid. So far, compared to human and mouse, fewer miRNAs (only 54 miRNAs) were identified in Sus scrofa species. These 65 new miRNAs and their targets in pig have been run through miRHelper to yield data that may help us better understand the possible role of miRNAs in regulating the growth and development of pigs. These findings suggest that EST analysis is a good alternative strategy for identifying new miRNA candidates, their targets and other genes.",0.718,1689

Although enamel thickness and enamel dentine junction (EDJ) morphology preserve important information about hominin systematics and dietary adaptation, these features have not been sufficiently studied with regard to early Homo. We used micro-CT to compare enamel thickness and EDJ morphology among the mandibular postcanine dentitions of South African early hominins (N = 30) and extant Homo sapiens (N = 26), with special reference to early members of the genus Homo. We found that South African early Homo shows a similar enamel thickness distribution pattern to modern humans, although three-dimensional average and relative enamel thicknesses do not distinguish australopiths, early Homo, and modern humans particularly well. Based on enamel thickness distributions, our study suggests that a dietary shift occurred between australopiths and the origin of the Homo lineage. We also observed that South African early Homo postcanine EDJ combined primitive traits seen in australopith molars with derived features observed in modern human premolars.

The taxonomic status of these populations has been clouded by controversy. Perhaps the most critical problem has been an incomplete understanding of variation in skull form. Here, both H. erectus and later mid-Pleistocene hominins are the focus of an investigation aimed at clarifying the relationships among brain volume, basicranial dimensions, neurocranial shape, and certain facial characters. Brain size in H. erectus averages about 950 cm(3), while in a series of Middle Pleistocene crania from Africa and Europe, volume is about 1230 cm(3). If encephalization is the primary mechanism operating in the mid-Pleistocene, then diverse aspects of cranial form cannot all be treated as independent variables. Correlation is utilized to examine the associations among measurements for more than 30 H. erectus crania that are reasonably well preserved. A similar approach is used with the Middle Pleistocene sample. Patterns of covariation are compared in order to assess integration. Next, factor analysis is applied to the H. erectus specimens in an attempt to identify modules, tightly integrated traits that can evolve independently. Studies of the variation within H. erectus are followed by direct comparisons with the Middle Pleistocene population. Discriminant functions facilitate the description of intergroup differences. Traits that vary independently from brain volume include anterior frontal broadening, lateral expansion of the parietal vault, elevation of the lambda-inion chord, and rounding of the sagittal contour of the occipital. This finding helps to resolve the problem of species recognition. Neurocranial proportions as well as characters from the cranial base and face can be incorporated into a differential diagnosis for the mid-Pleistocene sample. Evidence presented here supports arguments for speciation in the Middle Pleistocene.",3.733,196

In modern humans, expansion of the parietal surface occurs during the first year of life, in a morphogenetic stage which is absent in chimpanzees and Neandertals. A similar variation in brain shape among living adult humans is associated with expansion of the precuneus. Using MRI-derived structural brain templates, we compare medial brain morphology between humans and chimpanzees through shape analysis and geometrical modeling. We find that the main spatial difference is a prominent expansion of the precuneus in our species, providing further evidence of evolutionary changes associated with this area. The precuneus is a major hub of brain organization, a central node of the default-mode network, and plays an essential role in visuospatial integration. Together, the comparative neuroanatomical and paleontological evidence suggest that precuneus expansion is a neurological specialization of H. sapiens that evolved in the last 150,000 years that may be associated with recent human cognitive specializations.",5.618,564

Here, we identified in addition to the splice variant Smad6s, possessing a different N-terminus, a novel human Smad6 splice variant, termed Smad6B, in human prostatic and rodent testicular cell lines. Due to an alternative exon, the putative Smad6B protein exhibits a truncated C-terminus lacking the entire MH-2 domain and most parts of the linker region. While full-length Smad6 was expressed in almost all tissues and cell lines studied, expression of the splice variants Smad6s and Smad6B was more heterogenous. Species-specific sequence comparison revealed that Smad6 is found in most species, while Smad6s was found only in Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes, and Smad6B was found only in Homo sapiens. In addition, Smad6 localisation was found in round spermatids of human testis. In conclusion, we propose that alternative splicing of Smad6s and Smad6B is restricted to higher mammals.",1.63,1728

Here we aim to identify new drug targets in Plasmodium falciparum by phylogenomics among the Plasmodium spp. and comparative genomics to Homo sapiens. The proposed target discovery pipeline is largely independent of experimental data and based on the assumption that P. falciparum proteins are likely to be essential if (i) there are no similar proteins in the same proteome and (ii) they are highly conserved across the malaria parasites of mammals. This hypothesis was tested using sequenced Saccharomycetaceae species as a touchstone. Consecutive filters narrowed down the potential target space of P. falciparum to proteins that are likely to be essential, matchless in the human proteome, expressed in the blood stages of the parasite, and amenable to small molecule inhibition. The final set of 40 candidate drug targets was significantly enriched in essential proteins and comprised proven targets (e.g. dihydropteroate synthetase or enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway), targets currently under investigation (e.g. calcium-dependent protein kinases), and new candidates of potential interest such as phosphomannose isomerase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, signaling components, and transporters. The targets were prioritized based on druggability indices and on the availability of in vitro assays. Potential inhibitors were inferred from similarity to known targets of other disease systems. The identified candidates from P. falciparum provide insight into biochemical peculiarities and vulnerable points of the malaria parasite and might serve as starting points for rational drug discovery.",3.294,1269

Therefore accurate identification of protein complexes is indispensable. METHODS: For more accurate detection of protein complexes, we propose an algorithm which detects dense protein sub-networks of which proteins share closely located bottleneck proteins. The proposed algorithm is capable of finding protein complexes which allow overlapping with each other. RESULTS: We applied our algorithm to several PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens, and validated our results using public databases of protein complexes. The prediction accuracy was even more improved over our previous work which used also bottleneck information of the PPI network, but showed limitation when predicting small-sized protein complex detection.

 1989)",1997,"PROBLEM: The reproductive process is a major driving force in human evolution. An evolutionary perspective was brought to bear on some aspects of reproduction and its aberrations, and, conversely, some of the insights of modern reproductive genetics were used to investigate problems in evolution. METHOD: The data used were obtained from the literature in evolution, anthropology, archeology, linguistics, and genetics. RESULTS: The evolutionary line leading to modern humans diverged from that leading to the chimpanzees approximately 5-7 million years ago (Mya). Archaic Homo sapiens emerged ca. 0.3 Mya, and modern Homo sapiens and the development of language ca. 0.1 Mya; thus, modern humans occupy approximately 2% of the evolutionary history of the hominid line. During all of this time, the ancestors of modern humans were migratory hunter-gatherers. It was only during the Neolithic transition ca. 0.01 Mya (approximately 0.2% of hominid evolutionary history) that agriculture was developed, and with it a settled lifestyle that allowed a more stable existence and the development of a different reproductive pattern. Various estimates indicate that the human population increased from 0.05 million at the time of the emergence of modern Homo sapiens to 6,000 million at the present time (120,000-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS: These evolutionary considerations were used to explore three areas: (1) the extinction of the Neanderthals, who coexisted for ca. 65,000 years with modern humans; (2) the relatively low and stable rate of human conceptions (20-35% of ova fertilized naturally or fertilized in vitro); and (3) the long postnatal period required for the full maturation of the immune response.

Here, we study Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D), focusing on growth of glutamate, beta-alanine, taurine and hypotaurine, and butanoate metabolisms involved in onset of GAD and INS genes in Homo sapiens with comparative analysis in non-obese diabetic Mus musculus, biobreeding Diabetes-prone Rattus norvegicus, Pan troglodytes, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster respectively. METHODS: We propose an algorithm for growth analysis for four metabolic pathways involved in T1D. It has three modules, pattern finding, interaction identification and growth detection. The first module identifies patterns using Community structures using Hamming distances and the Tanimoto coefficient. We have performed functional analysis by representing patterns using ODEs, and identified Stoichiometric, Gradient and Jacobian matrices. The second module identifies interactions among patterns using cut-sets and network-partitioning by 'Divide-and-conquer'. The third module identifies functions of patterns using interactions, thereby highlighting their nature of growth. RESULTS: We observed that metabolites that are genetically robust and resist alterations against stable state during evolution, account for emergence of a scale-free network. DISCUSSION: New modules get acquired to the fundamental cluster in a preferential manner, an instance of micro-evolution theory. For instance, (S)-3-hydroxy butanoyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, acetoacetate, acetyl-CoA, (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-CoA acts as a fundamental cluster in butanoate metabolism. Moreover, the interactions among metabolites are divergent in nature.",1.24,774

AIM: To investigate the possibility that serum levels of Homo sapiens miR-142 stem-loop (hsa-miR-142-3p), one of the miRNAs regulating the expression of integrin alphaV, could be a specific disease marker for SSc. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 61 patients with SSc and 20 healthy controls. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis (DM) and scleroderma spectrum disorder (SSD), who did not fulfil American College of Rheumatology criteria for SSc but might develop SSc in the future, were included as disease controls in this study. miRNAs were purified from serum, and miR-142-3p levels were measured with a quantitative real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Serum miR-142-3p levels in patients with SSc were significantly higher than in patients with SSD, SLE or DM, and healthy control groups. Patients with increased miR-142-3p levels tended to have a short sublingual frenulum.

Generally, promoters have been classified in two major classes, namely TATA and CpG. Nevertheless, many genes using the same combinatorial formation of transcription factors have different gene expression patterns. Accordingly, we tried to ask ourselves some fundamental questions: Why certain genes have an overall predisposition for higher gene expression levels than others? What causes such a predisposition? Is there a structural relationship of these sequences in different tissues? Is there a strong phylogenetic relationship between promoters of closely related species? RESULTS: In order to gain valuable insights into different promoter regions, we obtained a series of image-based patterns which allowed us to identify 10 generic classes of promoters. A comprehensive analysis was undertaken for promoter sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens and Oryza sativa, and a more extensive analysis of tissue-specific promoters in humans. We observed a clear preference for these species to use certain classes of promoters for specific biological processes. Moreover, in humans, we found that different tissues use distinct classes of promoters, reflecting an emerging promoter network. Depending on the tissue type, comparisons made between these classes of promoters reveal a complementarity between their patterns whereas some other classes of promoters have been observed to occur in competition. Furthermore, we also noticed the existence of some transitional states between these classes of promoters that may explain certain evolutionary mechanisms, which suggest a possible predisposition for specific levels of gene expression and perhaps for a different number of factors responsible for triggering gene expression. Our conclusions are based on comprehensive data from three different databases and a new computer model whose core is using Kappa index of coincidence. CONCLUSIONS: To fully understand the connections between gene promoters and gene expression, we analyzed thousands of promoter sequences using our Kappa Index of Coincidence method and a specialized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) neural network. Under our criteria, 10 classes of promoters were detected. In addition, the existence of",3.986,1243

Previously, using an operant conditioning paradigm, we found that black-capped chickadees and humans show similar response patterns in discriminating triadic chords of the same timbre and transferred this discrimination to a novel key center (novel absolute pitch). The current study examined how varying the timbre of the chords influenced discrimination. Using a similar operant conditioning procedure, we trained humans (Experiment 1) and chickadees (Experiments 2 and 3) to discriminate a major chord from 6 other chord types that had semitone deviations from the major chord. The pattern of errors of the 2 species replicated our previous findings. We then tested participants with novel timbres. We found that humans readily transferred their discrimination to novel timbres, suggesting they were attending to triadic pitch relations. The chickadees failed to transfer to novel timbres, suggesting they were using a different strategy to perform the original chord discrimination. We conducted an acoustic analysis examining frequency ranges that are biologically relevant to chickadees. We found that the relative intensity within each chord of the frequencies used in black-capped chickadee song significantly correlated with chickadees' percent response during probe testing. In Experiment 3, we trained a new set of chickadees by including either expanded pitch or timbre training before testing. Although chickadees showed some transfer to novel chords following this expanded training, we found that neither type of expanded training helped the chickadees when probe tested with novel stimuli.",1.52,68

In this study we analyzed the shape of the shoulder joint (proximal humerus and glenoid cavity of the scapula) of three australopith specimens: A.L. 288-1 (A. afarensis), Sts 7 (A. africanus) and Omo 119-73-2718 (Australopithecus sp.) with three-dimensional geometric morphometrics. The morphology of the specimens was compared with that of a wide array of living anthropoid taxa and some additional fossil hominins (the Homo erectus specimen KNM-WT 15000 and the H. neanderthalensis specimen Tabun 1). Our results indicate that A.L. 288-1 shows mosaic traits resembling H. sapiens and Pongo, whereas the Sts 7 shoulder is most similar to the arboreal apes and does not present affinities with H. sapiens. Omo 119-73-2718 exhibits morphological affinities with the more arboreal and partially suspensory New World monkey Lagothrix. The shoulder of the australopith specimens thus shows a combination of primitive and derived traits (humeral globularity, enhancement of internal and external rotation of the joint), related to use of the arm in overhead positions.

Recently, we have developed a two-hybrid ecdysone receptor (EcR) gene switch using chimera 9 [CH9, a chimera between helices 1-8 of Homo sapiens retinoid X receptor (HsRXR) and helices 9-12 of Locusta migratoria RXR (LmRXR)] as a partner for Choristoneura fumiferana EcR (CfEcR). As CH9 includes a region of human RXR, public acceptance of this gene switch for use in genetically modified crops may be an issue. The current studies were conducted to identify an LmRXR mutant that could replace CH9 as a partner for CfEcR. The amino acid identity between LmRXR and HsRXR is fairly high. However, there are a few amino acid residues that are different between these two proteins. LmRXR mutants were produced by changing the amino acids in the helices 1-8 that are different between LmRXR and HsRXR to HsRXR residues. Screening of these mutants in tobacco protoplasts identified a triple mutant, A62S:T81H:V123I (SHILmRXR), that performed as well as CH9. The performance of the EcR gene switch was further improved by optimizing the translational start site (Kozak sequence, AACAATGG) of the transgene. The EcR gene switch containing SHILmRXR and the modified translation start site supported very low background activity in the absence of a ligand and a higher induced activity in the presence of a ligand in tobacco protoplasts, as well as Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants. At 16-80 nm methoxyfenozide, the induction of luciferase activity was better than that observed with the CfEcR:CH9 switch.",0,1615

It is established fact that epigenetic mechanisms are associated with DNA and histones. Initial studies emphasize on core histones association with DNA, however later studies prove the importance of linker histone H1 epigenetic. There are many types of linker histone H1 found in mammals. These subtypes are cell specific and their amount in different types of cells varies as the cell functions. Many types of post-translational modifications which occur on different residues in each subtype of linker histone H1 induce conformational changes and allow the different subtypes of linker histone H1 to interact with chromatin at different stages during cell cycle which results in the regulation of transcription and gene expression. Proposed O-glycosylation of linker histone H1 promotes condensation of chromatin while phosphorylation of linker histone H1 is known to activate transcription and gene regulation by decondensation of chromatin. Interplay between phosphorylation and O-beta-GlcNAc modification on Ser and Thr residues in each subtype of linker histone H1 in Homo sapiens during cell cycle may result in diverse functional regulation of proteins.

We characterized the effects of altering the levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a key component of the DNA replication machinery, in bloodstream form T. brucei. This study demonstrated that tight regulation of TbPCNA levels was critical for normal proliferation and DNA replication in the parasite. Depleting TbPCNA mRNA reduced proliferation, severely diminished DNA replication, arrested the synthesis of new DNA and caused the parasites to accumulated in G2/M. Attenuating the parasite by downregulating TbPCNA caused it to become hypersensitive to hydroxyurea. Overexpressing TbPCNA in T. brucei arrested proliferation, inhibited DNA replication and prevented the parasite from exiting G2/M. These results indicate that distinct mechanisms of cell cycle arrest are associated with upregulating or downregulating TbPCNA. The findings of this study validate deregulating intra-parasite levels of TbPCNA as a potential strategy for therapeutically exploiting this target in bloodstream form T. brucei.",0,657

We undertook a taphonomic study to investigate the circumstances of preservation of the human skeleton in Tianyuan Cave, and in course of this we considered four hypotheses: funerary ritual, cannibalism, carnivore activity or natural death. Taphonomic results characterize the role of human action in the site and how these agents acted in the past. Because of disturbance of the human skeleton during its initial excavation, it is not known if it was in a grave cut or if there was any funerary ritual. No evidence was found for cannibalism or carnivore activity in relation to the human skeleton, suggesting natural death as the most reasonable possibility.",3.733,265

Deletion of this gene could play a role in the characteristics of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), involving cell adhesion, migration and/or invasion. This study investigated the mechanisms by which FAT1 is involved in the biological behavior of OSCCs. First, a rat monoclonal antibody was developed against a FAT1 intra-cellular domain epitope, and used for an immunohistochemical study of FAT1 in clinically obtained OSCC samples. FAT1 was localized at lamellipodial edges or cell-cell boundaries in normal cells and well differentiated OSCCs, but showed a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in moderately-poorly differentiated OSCCs. FAT1-siRNA was transfected into OSCCs resulting in a drastic inhibition of cell migration and invasion based on the suppression of FAT1 expression and disorganized localization of beta-catenin which is associated with cell polarity and migration. These results suggested that FAT1 may be involved in the migration and invasion mechanisms of OSCCs and, therefore, it could be an important target for the development of new therapeutic strategies.",2.301,1468

Extracting functional modules in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is one such use. Most clustering algorithms whose focuses are on finding functional modules try either to find a clique like sub networks or to grow clusters starting from vertices with high degrees as seeds. These algorithms do not make any difference between a biological network and any other networks. In the current research, we present a new procedure to find functional modules in PPI networks. Our main idea is to model a biological concept and to use this concept for finding good functional modules in PPI networks. In order to evaluate the quality of the obtained clusters, we compared the results of our algorithm with those of some other widely used clustering algorithms on three high throughput PPI networks from Sacchromyces Cerevisiae, Homo sapiens and Caenorhabditis elegans as well as on some tissue specific networks. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were used to compare the results of different algorithms. Each algorithm's result was then compared with GO-term derived functional modules. We also analyzed the effect of using tissue specific networks on the quality of the obtained clusters. The experimental results indicate that the new algorithm outperforms most of the others, and this improvement is more significant when tissue specific networks are used.",3.234,1187

Although this foramen has been considered a single entity, we hypothesize that it comprises two functional matrices, a ventral matrix and a dorsal matrix. In general, the ventral matrix is related to locomotor functions, whereas the dorsal matrix is related to neurological functions and fluid flow dynamics. To test our hypothesis, we used a large ontogenetic sample of modern human crania (seventh fetal month to adult) to (1) delineate bony size and shape ontogeny for both the foramen and its dorsal and ventral units; (2) delineate the role of synchondroses in the observed growth patterns and rates; and (3) explore the relationship between FM and cranial size, shape, and growth. Detailed growth patterns and rates are established for the bony FM and its ventral and dorsal skeletal units. These data are supplemented by literature and observational data on embryonic and fetal FM ontogeny, soft tissue relationships, anomalous/pathological extremes of size, and craniocervical anatomy and locomotor functions. The hypothesis that the FM is composed of a ventral and a dorsal functional matrix is supported by observed ontogenetic differences between ventral and dorsal skeletal units, as well as by the soft tissue anatomy of these matrices. Further documentation of these matrices has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the ontogenetic and evolutionary transformations of skull base morphology.",1.542,184

Trabecular bone of the hand may be particularly functionally informative because the hand has more direct contact with the substrate compared with the remainder of the forelimb during locomotion in quadrupedal mammals. This study investigates the trabecular structure within the wrist across a sample of haplorhine primates that vary in locomotor behaviour (and thus hand use) and body size. High-resolution microtomographic scans were collected of the lunate, scaphoid, and capitate in 41 individuals and eight genera (Homo, Gorilla, Pan, Papio, Pongo, Symphalangus, Hylobates, and Ateles). We predicted that particular trabecular parameters would 1) vary across suspensory, quadrupedal, and bipedal primates based on differences in hand use and load, and 2) scale with carpal size following similar allometric patterns found previously in other skeletal elements across a larger sample of mammals and primates. Analyses of variance (trabecular parameters analysed separately) and principal component analyses (trabecular parameters analysed together) revealed no clear functional signal in the trabecular structure of any of the three wrist bones. Instead, there was a large degree of variation within suspensory and quadrupedal locomotor groups, as well as high intrageneric variation within some taxa, particularly Pongo and Gorilla. However, as predicted, Homo sapiens, which rarely use their hands for locomotion and weight support, were unique in showing lower relative bone volume (BV/TV) compared with all other taxa. Furthermore, parameters used to quantify trabecular structure within the wrist scale with size generally following similar allometric patterns found in trabeculae of other mammalian skeletal elements.

 science",1990,"Attempts to draw a line of genetic demarcation between schizophrenic and affective illnesses have failed. It must be assumed that these diseases are genetically related. A postmortem study has demonstrated that enlargement of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle in schizophrenia but not in Alzheimer-type dementia is selective to the left side of the brain. This suggest that the gene for psychosis is the 'cerebral dominance gene', the factor that determines the asymmetrical development of the human brain. That the psychosis gene is located in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes is consistent with observations that sibling pairs with schizophrenia are more often than would be expected of the same sex and share alleles of a polymorphic marker at the short-arm telomeres of the X and Y chromosomes above chance expectation. That the cerebral dominance gene also is pseudoautosomal is suggested by the pattern of verbal and performance deficits associated with sex-chromosome aneuploidies. The psychoses may thus represent aberrations of a late evolutionary development underlying the recent and rapid increase in brain weight in the transition from Australopithecus through Homo habilis and Homo erectus to Homo sapiens.",0,1857

We examine this evolutionary convergence by conducting fracture experiments on extracted molar teeth of sea otters and modern humans (Homo sapiens) to determine how load-bearing capacity relates to tooth morphology and enamel material properties. In situ optical microscopy and x-ray imaging during simulated occlusal loading reveal the nature of the fracture patterns. Explicit fracture relations are used to analyze the data and to extrapolate the results from humans to earlier hominins. It is shown that the molar teeth of sea otters have considerably thinner enamel than those of humans, making sea otter molars more susceptible to certain kinds of fractures. At the same time, the base diameter of sea otter first molars is larger, diminishing the fracture susceptibility in a compensatory manner. We also conduct nanoindentation tests to map out elastic modulus and hardness of sea otter and human molars through a section thickness, and microindentation tests to measure toughness. We find that while sea otter enamel is just as stiff elastically as human enamel, it is a little softer and tougher. The role of these material factors in the capacity of dentition to resist fracture and deformation is considered. From such comparisons, we argue that early hominin species like Paranthropus most likely consumed hard food objects with substantially higher biting forces than those exerted by modern humans.",3.733,1479

We cloned and assessed the function of two insulin receptors from Schistosoma japonicum in order to shed light on their role in schistosome biology. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We isolated, from S. japonicum, insulin receptors 1 (SjIR-1) and 2 (SjIR-2) sharing close sequence identity to their S. mansoni homologues (SmIR-1 and SmIR-2). SjIR-1 is located on the tegument basal membrane and the internal epithelium of adult worms, whereas SjIR-2 is located in the parenchyma of males and the vitelline tissue of females. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SjIR-2 and SmIR-2 are close to Echinococcus multilocularis insulin receptor (EmIR), suggesting that SjIR-2, SmIR-2 and EmIR share similar roles in growth and development in the three taxa. Structure homology modelling recovered the conserved structure between the SjIRs and Homo sapiens IR (HIR) implying a common predicted binding mechanism in the ligand domain and the same downstream signal transduction processing in the tyrosine kinase domain as in HIR. Two-hybrid analysis was used to confirm that the ligand domains of SjIR-1 and SjIR-2 contain the insulin binding site. Incubation of adult worms in vitro, both with a specific insulin receptor inhibitor and anti-SjIRs antibodies, resulted in a significant decrease in worm glucose levels, suggesting again the same function for SjIRs in regulating glucose uptake as described for mammalian cells. CONCLUSIONS: Adult worms of S. japonicum possess insulin receptors that can specifically bind to insulin, indicating that the parasite can utilize host insulin for development and growth by sharing the same pathway as mammalian cells in regulating glucose uptake. A complete understanding of the role of SjIRs in the biology of S. japonicum may result in their use as new targets for drug and vaccine development against schistosomiasis.",3.234,1798

Here, a yeast two-hybrid screen identified Homo sapiens sperm associated antigen 5 (SPAG5)/Astrin as interaction partner of ORP8. The putative interaction was further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. ORP8 did not colocalize with kinetochore-associated SPAG5 in mitotic HepG2 or HuH7 cells, but overexpressed ORP8 was capable of recruiting SPAG5 onto endoplasmic reticulum membranes in interphase cells. In our experiments, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) retarded the HepG2 cell cycle, causing accumulation in G2/M phase; ORP8 overexpression resulted in the same phenotype. Importantly, ORP8 knock-down dramatically inhibited the oxysterol effect on HepG2 cell cycle, suggesting a mediating role of ORP8. Furthermore, knock-down of SPAG5 significantly reduced the effects of both ORP8 overexpression and 25OHC on the cell cycle, placing SPAG5 downstream of the two cell-cycle interfering factors. Taken together, the present results suggest that ORP8 may via SPAG5 mediate oxysterol interference of the HepG2 cell cycle.",3.246,73

In cancer, male DXZ4 can inappropriately revert to a Xi-like state and other MSRs have been reported to adopt alternate chromatin configurations in response to disease. Given this plasticity, we sought to identify factors that might control heterochromatin at DXZ4. In human embryonic stem cells, we found low levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at DXZ4 and that this mark is lost upon differentiation as H3K9me3 is acquired. We identified two previously undescribed DXZ4 associated noncoding transcripts (DANT1 and DANT2) that are transcribed toward DXZ4 from promoters flanking the array. Each generates transcript isoforms that traverse the MSR. However, upon differentiation, enhancer of Zeste-2 silences DANT1, and DANT2 transcription terminates prior to entering DXZ4.

By analyzing methylation data of 25 cell lines from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium, we compared the DNA methylation of CpG islands in genomic regions under selective pressure with the methylation of CpG islands in the remaining part of the genome. To define genomic regions under selective pressure, we used three different methods, each oriented to provide distinct information about selective events. Independently of the method and of the cell type used, we found evidences of undermethylation of CGIs in human genomic regions under selective pressure. Additionally, by analyzing SNP frequency in CpG islands, we demonstrated that CpG islands in regions under selective pressure show lower genetic variation. Our findings suggest that the CpG islands in regions under selective pressure seem to be somehow more",3.234,1581

Therefore, the identification of ME in mitochondria from immortalized A. stephensi (ASE) cells and the investigation of the stereoselectivity of malate analogues are relevant in understanding the physiological role of ME in cells of this important malaria parasite vector and its potential as a possible novel target for insecticide development. METHODS: To characterize the mitochondrial ME from immortalized ASE cells (Mos. 43; ASE), mass spectrometry analyses of trypsin fragments of ME, genomic sequence analysis and biochemical assays were performed to identify the enzyme and evaluate its activity in terms of cofactor dependency and inhibitor preference. RESULTS: The encoding gene sequence and primary sequences of several peptides from mitochondrial ME were found to be highly homologous to the mitochondrial ME from Anopheles gambiae (98%) and 59% homologous to the mitochondrial NADP+-dependent ME isoform from Homo sapiens. Measurements of ME activity in mosquito mitochondria isolated from ASE cells showed that (i) Vmax with NAD+ was 3-fold higher than that with NADP+, (ii) addition of Mg2+ or Mn2+ increased the Vmax by 9- to 21-fold, with Mn2+ 2.3-fold more effective than Mg2+, (iii) succinate and fumarate increased the activity by 2- and 5-fold, respectively, at sub-saturating concentrations of malate, (iv) among the analogs of L-malate tested as inhibitors of the NAD+-dependent ME catalyzed reaction, small (2- to 3-carbons) organic diacids carrying a 2-hydroxyl/keto group behaved as the most potent inhibitors of ME activity (e.g., oxaloacetate, tartronic acid and oxalate). CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical characterization of Anopheles stephensi ME is of critical relevance given its important role in bioenergetics, suggesting that it is a suitable target for insecticide development.",3.109,1488
21716744,Upper Pleistocene Human Dispersals out of Africa: A Review of the Current State of the Debate.,['Beyin A'],International journal of evolutionary biology,2011,"Although there is a general consensus on African origin of early modern humans, there is disagreement about how and when they dispersed to Eurasia. This paper reviews genetic and Middle Stone Age/Middle Paleolithic archaeological literature from northeast Africa, Arabia, and the Levant to assess the timing and geographic backgrounds of Upper Pleistocene human colonization of Eurasia. At the center of the discussion lies the question of whether eastern Africa alone was the source of Upper Pleistocene human dispersals into Eurasia or were there other loci of human expansions outside of Africa? The reviewed literature hints at two modes of early modern human colonization of Eurasia in the Upper Pleistocene: (i) from multiple Homo sapiens source populations that had entered Arabia, South Asia, and the Levant prior to and soon after the onset of the Last Interglacial (MIS-5), (ii) from a rapid dispersal out of East Africa via the Southern Route (across the Red Sea basin), dating to ~74-60 kya.",3.313,1606
