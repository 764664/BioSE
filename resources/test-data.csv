25918994,Genome-wide methylation study on depression: differential methylation and variable methylation in monozygotic twins.,"['Cordova-Palomera A', 'Fatjo-Vilas M', 'Gasto C', 'Navarro V', 'Krebs MO', 'Fananas L']",Translational psychiatry,2015,"Depressive disorders have been shown to be highly influenced by environmental pathogenic factors, some of which are believed to exert stress on human brain functioning via epigenetic modifications. Previous genome-wide methylomic studies on depression have suggested that, along with differential DNA methylation, affected co-twins of monozygotic (MZ) pairs have increased DNA methylation variability, probably in line with theories of epigenetic stochasticity. Nevertheless, the potential biological roots of this variability remain largely unexplored. The current study aimed to evaluate whether DNA methylation differences within MZ twin pairs were related to differences in their psychopathological status. Data from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to evaluate peripheral blood DNA methylation of 34 twins (17 MZ pairs). Two analytical strategies were used to identify (a) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and (b) variably methylated probes (VMPs). Most DMPs were located in genes previously related to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Remarkably, one of these DMPs (cg01122889) was located in the WDR26 gene, the DNA sequence of which has been implicated in major depressive disorder from genome-wide association studies. Expression of WDR26 has also been proposed as a biomarker of depression in human blood. Complementarily, VMPs were located in genes such as CACNA1C, IGF2 and the p38 MAP kinase MAPK11, showing enrichment for biological processes such as glucocorticoid signaling. These results expand on previous research to indicate that both differential methylation and differential variability have a role in the etiology and clinical manifestation of depression, and provide clues on specific genomic loci of potential interest in the epigenetics of depression.",5.62,697
27488925,Expression analysis and promoter methylation under osmotic and salinity stress of TaGAPC1 in wheat (Triticum aestivum L).,"['Fei Y', 'Xue Y', 'Du P', 'Yang S', 'Deng X']",Protoplasma,2016,"Cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) catalyzes a key reaction in glycolysis and encoded by a multi-gene family which showed instability expression under abiotic stress. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in gene regulation in response to abiotic stress. The comprehension of DNA methylation at promoter region of TaGAPC1 can provide insights into the transcription regulation mechanisms of plant genes under abiotic stress. In this study, we cloned TaGAPC1 genes and its promoters from two wheat genomes, then investigated the expression patterns of TaGAPC1 under osmotic and salinity stress, and analyzed the promoter sequences. Moreover, the methylation patterns of promoters under stress were confirmed. Expression analysis indicated that TaGAPC1 was induced inordinately by stresses in two wheat genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance. Several stress-related cis-acting elements (MBS, DRE, GT1 and LTR et al.) were located in its promoters. Furthermore, the osmotic and salinity stress induced the demethylation of CG and CHG nucleotide in the promoter region of Changwu134. The methylation level of CHG and CHH in promoter of Zhengyin1 was always increased under stresses, and the CG contexts remained unchanged. The cytosine loci of stress-related cis-acting elements also showed different methylation changes in this process. These results provide insights into the relationship between promoter methylation and gene expression, promoting the function investigation of GAPC.",2.651,756

SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3 methylation have been studied in MPN with discordant results. Herein, we studied the methylation status of SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3, CISH and SHP1 by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in cell lines and 45 diagnostic marrow samples of Ph-ve MPN. Moreover, we attempted to explain the discordance of methylation frequency by mapping the studied MSP primers to the respective genes. Methylation was detected in normal controls using SOCS2 MSP primers in the 3'translated exonic sequence, but not primers around the transcription start site in the 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR). SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3 and CISH were completely unmethylated in primary MPN samples and cell lines. In contrast, methylation of SHP1 was detected in 8.9% primary marrow samples. Moreover, SHP1 was completely methylated in K562 cell line, leading to reversible SHP1 silencing. A review of methylation studies of SOCS1 and SOCS3 showed that spuriously high rates of SOCS methylation had been reported using MSP primers targeting CpG sites in the 3'translated exonic sequence, which is also methylated in normal controls. However, using MSP primers localized to the 5'UTR, methylation of SOCS1, SOCS2 and SOCS3 is infrequent across all studies. In summary, methylation of SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3 and CISH is infrequent in Ph-ve MPN. Appropriate MSP primers are important for accurate estimation of the methylation frequency. The role of SHP1 methylation in the pathogenesis of MPN warrants further investigation.",4.014,1496

We investigated epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles in prostate cancer (PCa) compared to adjacent benign tissue to identify differentially methylated CpG sites. METHODS: The study included paired PCa and adjacent benign tissue samples from 20 radical prostatectomy patients. Epigenetic profiling was done using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models that accounted for the paired study design and False Discovery Rate Q-values were used to evaluate differential CpG methylation. mRNA expression levels of the genes with the most differentially methylated CpG sites were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 2,040 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified in PCa versus adjacent benign tissue (Q-value < 0.001), the majority of which were hypermethylated (n = 1,946; 95%). DNA methylation profiles accurately distinguished between PCa and benign tissue samples. Twenty-seven top-ranked hypermethylated CpGs had a mean methylation difference of at least 40% between tissue types, which included 25 CpGs in 17 genes. Furthermore, for 10 genes over 50% of promoter region CpGs were hypermethylated in PCa versus benign tissue. The top-ranked differentially methylated genes included three genes that were associated with both promoter hypermethylation and reduced gene expression: SCGB3A1, HIF3A, and AOX1. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data provided confirmatory evidence for our findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study of PCa versus adjacent benign tissue showed many differentially methylated CpGs and regions in and outside gene promoter regions, which may potentially be used for the development of future epigenetic-based diagnostic tests or as therapeutic targets.",0,202

HPV genomes were analyzed using bisulfite DNA modification procedure with the subsequent amplification of target DNA regions and sequencing. A collection of 202 cervical specimens was analyzed: 157 HPV16-positive specimens, 21 HPV18-positive specimens and 24 HPV51-positive specimens. This study revealed that methylation of CpG was significantly more prevalent in L1 gene as compared to LCR region of all three studied HPV types and the degree of DNA methylation level correlated with the severity of cervical neoplasia. An increased DNA methylation level of HPV16 promoter region in case of cervical cancer was determined.",3.321,498
27349222,5-azacytidine induces transcriptome changes in Escherichia coli via DNA methylation-dependent and DNA methylation-independent mechanisms.,"['Militello KT', 'Simon RD', 'Mandarano AH', 'DiNatale A', 'Hennick SM', 'Lazatin JC', 'Cantatore S']",BMC microbiology,2016,"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli K-12 strains contain DNA cytosine methyltransferase (Dcm), which generates 5-methylcytosine at 5'CCWGG3' sites. Although the role of 5-methylcytosine in eukaryotic gene expression is relatively well described, the role of 5-methylcytosine in bacterial gene expression is largely unknown. RESULTS: To identify genes that are controlled by 5-methylcytosine in E. coli, we compared the transcriptomes of cells grown in the absence and presence of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. We observed expression changes for 63 genes. The majority of the gene expression changes occurred at early stationary phase and were up-regulations. To identify gene expression changes due to a loss of DNA methylation, we compared the expression of selected genes in a wild-type and dcm knockout strain via reverse transcription quantitative PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that 5-azacytidine can influence gene expression by at least two distinct mechanisms: DNA methylation loss and a mechanism that is independent of DNA methylation loss. In addition, we have identified new targets of 5-methylcytosine-mediated regulation of gene expression. In summary, our data indicate that 5-azacytidine impacts the composition of the bacterial transcriptome, and the primary effect is increased gene expression at early stationary phase.",2.729,1054

A better knowledge of molecular factors involved in choroid plexus tumor biology may aid in identifying patients at risk for recurrence. METHODS: Methylation profiles were examined in 29 choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs, WHO grade I), 32 atypical choroid plexus papillomas (aCPPs, WHO grade II), and 31 choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs, WHO grade III) by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip Array. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified 3 subgroups: methylation cluster 1 (pediatric CPP and aCPP of mainly supratentorial location), methylation cluster 2 (adult CPP and aCPP of mainly infratentorial location), and methylation cluster 3 (pediatric CPP, aCPP, and CPC of supratentorial location). In methylation cluster 3, progression-free survival (PFS) accounted for a mean of 72 months (CI, 55-89 mo), whereas only 1 of 42 tumors of methylation clusters 1 and 2 progressed (P< .001). On stratification of outcome data according to WHO grade, all CPCs clustered within cluster 3 and were associated with shorter overall survival (mean, 105 mo [CI, 81-128 mo]) and PFS (mean, 55 mo [CI, 36-73 mo]). The aCPP of methylation cluster 3 also progressed frequently (mean, 69 mo [CI, 44-93 mo]), whereas no tumor progression was observed in aCPP of methylation clusters 1 and 2 (P< .05). Only 1 of 29 CPPs recurred. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation profiling of choroid plexus tumors reveals 3 distinct subgroups (ie, pediatric low-risk choroid plexus tumors [cluster 1], adult low-risk choroid plexus tumors [cluster 2], and pediatric high-risk choroid plexus tumors [cluster 3]) and may provide useful prognostic information in addition to histopathology.",5.562,1008
26370119,"Applicability of HIN-1, MGMT and RASSF1A promoter methylation as biomarkers for detecting field cancerization in breast cancer.","['Spitzwieser M', 'Holzweber E', 'Pfeiler G', 'Hacker S', 'Cichna-Markl M']",Breast cancer research : BCR,2015,"INTRODUCTION: It has been shown in some articles that genetic and epigenetic abnormalities cannot only be found in tumor tissues but also in adjacent regions that appear histologically normal. This phenomenon is metaphorically called field cancerization or field defect. Field cancerization is regarded as clinically significant because it is assumed to be an important factor in local recurrence of cancer. As the field showing these molecular abnormalities may not be removed completely by surgery, these changes might lead to neoplasms and subsequent transformation to a tumor. We aimed to investigate the applicability of the methylation status of six tumor suppressor genes as biomarkers for detecting field cancerization in breast cancer. METHODS: The promoter methylation status of CCND2, DAPK1, GSTP1, HIN-1, MGMT and RASSF1A was determined by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. MS-HRM methods for CCND2, MGMT and RASSF1A were developed in-house, primer sequences for DAPK1, GSTP1 and HIN-1 have already been published. Biopsy samples were taken from tumor, tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissue from 17 breast cancer patients. Normal breast tissues of four healthy women served as controls. RESULTS: All MS-HRM methods proved to be very sensitive. LODs were in the range from 0.1 to 1.5 %, LOQs ranged from 0.3 to 5.3 %. A total of 94 %, 82 % and 65 % of the tumors showed methylation of RASSF1A, HIN-1 and MGMT promoters, respectively. The methylation status of these promoters was significantly lower in tumor-distant tissues than in tumor tissues. Tumor-adjacent tissues showed higher methylation status of RASSF1A, HIN-1 and MGMT promoters than tumor-distant tissues, indicating field cancerization. The methylation status of the HIN-1 promoter in tumor-adjacent tissues was found to correlate strongly with that in the corresponding tumors (r = 0.785, p < 0.001), but not with that in the corresponding tumor-distant tissues (r = 0.312, p = 0.239). CONCLUSIONS: Among the gene promoters investigated, the methylation status of the HIN-1 promoter can be considered the best suitable biomarker for detecting field cancerization. Further investigation is needed to test whether it can be used for defining surgical margins in order to prevent future recurrence of breast cancer.",1.585,326

Accumulating evidence supports transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation changes in mammals via germ cells. Our aim was to determine the effect of exercise on sperm DNA methylation. MATERIALS & METHODS: Twenty-four men were recruited and assigned to an exercise intervention or control group. Clinical parameters were measured and sperm samples were donated by subjects before and after the 3-month time-period. Mature sperm global and genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using an ELISA assay and the 450K BeadChip (Illumina). RESULTS: Global and genome-wide sperm DNA methylation was altered after 3 months of exercise training. DNA methylation changes occurred in genes related to numerous diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence showing exercise training reprograms the sperm methylome. Whether these DNA methylation changes are inherited to future generations warrants attention.,4.649,372

Histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4 methylation) catalyzed by H3K4 specific histone methyltransferases is one of the more critical chromatin modifications that is generally associated with gene activation. Additionally, the deposition of H3 variant(s) in conjunction with H3K4 methylation generates an intricately reliable epigenetic regulatory circuit that guides transcriptional activity in normal development and homeostasis. Consequently, alterations in this epigenetic circuit may trigger disease development. The mechanistic relationship between H3 variant deposition and H3K4 methylation during normal development has remained foggy. However, recent investigations in the field of chromatin dynamics in various model organisms, tumors, cancer tissues, and cell lines cultured without and with therapeutic agents, as well as from model reconstituted chromatins reveal that there may be different subsets of chromatin assemblage with specific patterns of histone replacement executing similar functions. In this light, we attempt to explain the intricate control system that maintains chromatin structure and dynamics during normal development as well as during tumor development and cancer progression in this review. Our focus is to highlight the contribution of H3K4 methylation-histone variant crosstalk in regulating chromatin architecture and subsequently its function.",5.808,807

Yet no prior work has considered the contribution of methylation of NR3C1 to emerging behavior problems and psychopathology in childhood. This study examined the links between methylation of NR3C1 and behavior problems in preschoolers. Data were drawn from a sample of preschoolers with early adversity (n = 171). Children ranged in age from 3 to 5 years, were racially and ethnically diverse, and nearly all qualified for public assistance. Seventy-one children had child welfare documentation of moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6 months. Structured record review and interviews in the home were used to assess early adversity. Parents reported on child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Methylation of NR3C1 at exons 1D , 1F , and 1H were measured via sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing from saliva DNA. Methylation of NR3C1 at exons 1D and 1F was positively associated with internalizing (r = .21, p < .01 and r = .23, p < .01, respectively), but not externalizing, behavior problems. Furthermore, NR3C1 methylation mediated effects of early adversity on internalizing behavior problems. These results suggest that methylation of NR3C1 contributes to psychopathology in young children, and NR3C1 methylation from saliva DNA is salient to behavioral outcomes.",4.061,1742

Phenotypic variations, which mainly showed in leaf shape and SAM, were observed in selfed progenies GSn (GS = grafting-selfing, n = generations) of TTC. Here the heritability of phenotypic variation and its association with DNA methylation changes in GSn were investigated. Variation in leaf shape was found to be stably inherited to GS5, but SAM variation reverted over generations. Subsequent measurement of DNA methylation in GS1 revealed 5.29-6.59% methylation changes compared with tuber mustard (TTT), and 31.58% of these changes were stably transmitted to GS5, but the remainder reverted to the original status over generations, suggesting grafting-induced DNA methylation changes could be both heritable and reversible. Sequence analysis of differentially methylated fragments (DMFs) revealed methylation mainly changed within transposons and exon regions, which further affected the expression of genes, including flowering time- and gibberellin response-related genes. Interestingly, DMFs could match differentially expressed siRNA of GS1, GS3 and GS5, indicating that grafting-induced DNA methylation could be directed by siRNA changes. These results suggest grafting-induced DNA methylation may contribute to phenotypic variations induced by grafting.",5.578,1508

However, there is currently no direct evidence that CDH1 promoter methylation indicates poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. In the present study, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to detect the methylation status of the CDH1 promoter in 137 primary breast cancer, 85 matched normal breast tissue and 13 lung metastasis specimens. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to assess the relative expression levels of CDH1 mRNA, and correlation analysis between CDH1 methylation status, and gene expression, clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival was performed. Methylation of CDH1 was identified in 40.9% (56/137) of primary breast cancer specimens, 61.5% (8/13) of lung metastasis specimens and none of the matched normal breast specimens. The downregulation of CDH1 mRNA and E-cadherin protein expression were identified to be significantly correlated with CDH1 methylation (P<0.05). In addition, CDH1 methylation was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and estrogen receptor status of patients (P<0.05). In univariate analyses, patients with CDH1 methylation exhibited poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that CDH1 methylation was an independent prognostic factor predicting poor OS (HR, 1.737; 95% CI, 0.957-3.766; P=0.041) and DFS (HR, 2.018; 95% CI, 2.057-3.845; P=0.033) in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, the present study suggests that CDH1 promoter methylation may be correlated with breast carcinogenesis and indicates poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.",1.554,850

To identify which histone modifications are required for early embryonic development, we utilized histone K-M mutants, which prevent endogenous histone methylation at the mutated site. We prepared four single K-M mutants for histone H3.3, K4M, K9M, K27M, and K36M, and demonstrate that overexpression of H3.3 K4M in embryos before fertilization results in developmental arrest, whereas overexpression after fertilization does not affect the development. Furthermore, loss of H3K4 methylation decreases the level of minor zygotic gene activation (ZGA) predominantly in the paternal pronucleus, and we obtained similar results from knockdown of the H3K4 methyltransferase Mll3/4. We therefore conclude that H3K4 methylation, likely established by Mll3/4 at the early pronuclear stage, is essential for the onset of minor ZGA in the paternal pronucleus, which is necessary for subsequent preimplantation development in mice.",9.055,64

METHODS: The 5-methylcytosine content was assessed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography of peripheral blood leukocytes to determine an individual's global DNA methylation status in the two groups, either with or without retinopathy. RESULTS: The global DNA methylation levels were significantly higher in diabetic retinopathy patients compared with those in non-retinopathy patients (4.90 +/- 0.12 vs. 4.22 +/- 0.13, respectively; p = 0.001). There was a significant increasing trend in global DNA methylation levels in terms of progressing retinopathy (without retinopathy, 4.22 +/- 0.13; non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 4.62 +/- 0.17; proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 5.07 +/- 0.21) (p = 0.006). Additionally, global DNA methylation independent of retinopathy risk factors, which include dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and duration of diabetes, was a predictive factor for retinopathy (OR = 1.53, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Global DNA methylation is modulated during or possibly before the primary stage of diabetes.

RESULTS: While the majority of methylation is conserved across all three genomes we demonstrate that differential methylation exists between the sub-genomes in approximately equal proportions. We correlate sub-genome-specific promoter methylation with decreased expression levels and show that altered growing temperature has a small effect on methylation state, identifying a small but functionally relevant set of methylated genes. Finally, we demonstrate long-term methylation maintenance using a comparison between the D sub-genome of hexaploid wheat and its progenitor Aegilops tauschii.

Here, we address several questions regarding the control of recombination and its influence on genome evolution in dogs. First, we address whether the association between CpG islands (CGIs) and recombination hotspots is generated by lack of methylation, GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), or both. Using a genome-wide dog single nucleotide polymorphism data set and comparisons of the dog genome with related species, we show that recombination-associated CGIs have low CpG mutation rates, and that CpG mutation rate is negatively correlated with recombination rate genome wide, indicating that nonmethylation attracts the recombination machinery. We next use a neighbor-dependent model of nucleotide substitution to disentangle the effects of CpG mutability and gBGC and analyze the effects that loss of PRDM9 has on these rates. We infer that methylation patterns have been stable during canid genome evolution, but that dog CGIs have experienced a drastic increase in substitution rate due to gBGC, consistent with increased levels of recombination in these regions. We also show that gBGC is likely to have generated many new CGIs in the dog genome, but these mostly occur away from genes, whereas the number of CGIs in gene promoter regions has not increased greatly in recent evolutionary history.

While both genetic and environmental risk factors have been implicated in AAA formation, the precise genetic markers involved and the factors influencing their expression remain an area of ongoing investigation. DNA methylation has been previously used to study gene silencing in other inflammatory disorders and since AAA has an extensive inflammatory component, we sought to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in mononuclear blood cells of AAA cases and matched non-AAA controls. To this end, we collected blood samples and isolated mononuclear cells for DNA and RNA extraction from four all male groups: AAA smokers (n = 11), AAA non-smokers (n = 9), control smokers (n = 10) and control non-smokers (n = 11). Methylation data were obtained using the Illumina 450k Human Methylation Bead Chip and analyzed using the R language and multiple Bioconductor packages. Principal component analysis and linear analysis of CpG island subsets identified four regions with significant differences in methylation with respect to AAA: kelch-like family member 35 (KLHL35), calponin 2 (CNN2), serpin peptidase inhibitor clade B (ovalbumin) member 9 (SERPINB9), and adenylate cyclase 10 pseudogene 1 (ADCY10P1). Follow-up studies included RT-PCR and immunostaining for CNN2 and SERPINB9. These findings are novel and suggest DNA methylation may play a role in AAA pathobiology.",2.862,381

Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation profiling often employs different designs and platforms with varying resolution, which hinders joint analysis of methylation data from multiple platforms. In this study, we propose a penalized functional regression model to impute missing methylation data. By incorporating functional predictors, our model utilizes information from nonlocal probes to improve imputation quality. Here, we compared the performance of our functional model to linear regression and the best single probe surrogate in real data and via simulations. Specifically, we applied different imputation approaches to an acute myeloid leukemia dataset consisting of 194 samples and our method showed higher imputation accuracy, manifested, for example, by a 94% relative increase in information content and up to 86% more CpG sites passing post-imputation filtering. Our simulated association study further demonstrated that our method substantially improves the statistical power to identify trait-associated methylation loci. These findings indicate that the penalized functional regression model is a convenient and valuable imputation tool for methylation data, and it can boost statistical power in downstream epigenome-wide association study (EWAS).",2.597,724

The most prevalent type of RNA methylation is methylation of nucleobases. However, despite recent advances in our knowledge of these marks, the biological roles of such modifications are still incompletely understood (Machnicka et al., 2013; Motorin & Helm, 2011; Sergeeva et al., 2014; Sergiev et al., 2011). A number of mechanisms have evolved to enable RNA methylation, which are tuned to the electronic demands of the substrate. Herein, we provide an overview of methods for expression, purification, and activity analysis of a specific type of RNA methylating enzymes, radical SAM methylsynthases. These enzymes modify the amidine carbon atoms of an adenosine, A2503, in bacterial 23S rRNA. The activities of these enzymes have only been recently reconstituted (Yan et al., 2010), which can be attributed to the complex anaerobic catalysis that they perform. As the substrate A2503 is located at the nascent peptide exit tunnel of the bacterial ribosome, methylations catalyzed by these enzymes have profound impact on the biology of the host strain. RlmN, an endogenous protein found in all bacteria, methylates the C2 amidine carbon and contributes to the translational fidelity (Benitez-Paez et al., 2012; Ramu et al., 2011; Vazquez-Laslop, Ramu, Klepacki, Kannan, & Mankin, 2010). Cfr, found in pathogenic species, methylates the C8 amidine carbon, a modification that confers resistance to various classes of antibiotics (Giessing et al., 2009; Long et al., 2006; Smith & Mankin, 2008). Interestingly, C2 methylated adenosine was recently detected in a subset of tRNAs, raising the question of the physiological role of this modification (Benitez-Paez et al., 2012). With an increase in available whole genome sequences, the development of methods to identify target substrates of RNA methylating enzymes (Khoddami & Cairns, 2013; Meyer et al., 2012; Tim, Katharina, & Matthias, 2010), as well as advances in the characterization of their activities, we anticipate the coming years will unravel novel aspects of mechanisms of the RNA methylation and deepen insight into the function of the resulting modification.",2.088,130

Restricted epigenetic inheritance of H3K9 methylation.,"['Audergon PN', 'Catania S', 'Kagansky A', 'Tong P', 'Shukla M', 'Pidoux AL', 'Allshire RC']","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2015,"Posttranslational histone modifications are believed to allow the epigenetic transmission of distinct chromatin states, independently of associated DNA sequences. Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is essential for heterochromatin formation; however, a demonstration of its epigenetic heritability is lacking. Fission yeast has a single H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4, that directs all H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin. Using releasable tethered Clr4 reveals that an active process rapidly erases H3K9 methylation from tethering sites in wild-type cells. However, inactivation of the putative histone demethylase Epe1 allows H3K9 methylation and silent chromatin maintenance at the tethering site through many mitotic divisions, and transgenerationally through meiosis, after release of tethered Clr4. Thus, H3K9 methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark whose transmission is usually countered by its active removal, which prevents the unauthorized inheritance of heterochromatin.",0,227

We used publicly available genome-scale DNA methylation and histone modification profiles to study their relationships among different genomic regions in human embryonic stem cells (H1), H1-derived neuronal progenitor cultured cells (NPC), and foetal fibroblasts (IMR90) using the Random forests classifier. Histone modifications achieved high accuracy in modelling DNA methylation patterns on a genome scale in the three cell types. The inclusion of sequence features helped improve accuracy only in non-promoter regions of IMR90. Furthermore, the top six feature combinations obtained by mean decrease Gini were important indicators of different DNA methylation patterns, suggesting that H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are important indicators that are independent of genomic regions and cell types. H3K9me3 was IMR90-specific and exhibited a genomic region-specific correlation with DNA methylation. Variations of essential chromatin modification signals may effectively discriminate changes of DNA methylation between H1 and IMR90. Genes with different co-variations of epigenetic marks exhibited genomic region-specific biological relevance. This study provides an integrated strategy to identify systematically essential epigenetic and genetic elements of genomic region-specific and cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns.",5.578,1045

Mucins (MUC) play crucial roles in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion in pancreatic neoplasms. MUC1 and MUC4 are high molecular weight transmembrane mucins. These are overexpressed in many carcinomas, and high expression of these molecules is a risk factor associated with poor prognosis. We evaluated the methylation status of MUC1 and MUC4 promoter regions in pancreatic tissue samples from 169 patients with various pancreatic lesions by the methylation specific electrophoresis (MSE) method. These results were compared with expression of MUC1 and MUC4, several DNA methylation/demethylation factors (e.g. ten-eleven translocation or TET, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase or AID) and CAIX (carbonic anhydrase IX, as a hypoxia biomarker). These results were also analyzed with clinicopathological features including time of overall survival of PDAC patients. We show that the DNA methylation status of the promoters of MUC1 and MUC4 in pancreatic tissue correlates with the expression of MUC1 and MUC4 mRNA. In addition, the expression of several DNA methylation/demethylation factors show a significant correlation with MUC1 and MUC4 methylation status. Furthermore, CAIX expression significantly correlates with the expression of MUC1 and MUC4. Interestingly, our results indicate that low methylation of MUC1 and/or MUC4 promoters correlates with decreased overall survival. This is the first report to show a relationship between MUC1 and/or MUC4 methylation status and prognosis. Analysis of epigenetic changes in mucin genes may be of diagnostic utility and one of the prognostic predictors for patients with PDAC.",6.359,636

METHODS: The assay was optimized by using synthetic control samples and validated by analyzing 165 clinical samples: a) 107 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPEs) samples of patients with early breast cancer, b) 27 FFPE samples of patients with metastatic breast cancer, c) 15 reduction mammoplasty specimens obtained from healthy women and d) 16 genomic DNA samples isolated from healthy blood donors. Comparison with real time MSP was also performed. RESULTS: The assay is highly specific and sensitive and provides a semi-quantitative estimation of SOX17 promoter methylation. SOX17 promoter was found methylated in 96/134 (71.6%) breast cancer samples, while none of the 31 non-cancerous samples tested was positive (0%). SOX17 promoter methylation levels varied significantly among samples. When 165 clinical samples were analyzed both by MS-HRMA and real time MSP results were significantly comparable (concordance: 146/165, 88.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This novel MS-HRMA assay for SOX17 promoter methylation is closed-tube, highly sensitive, specific, cost-effective, rapid and easy-to-perform. It gives comparable results to Real-Time MSP in less time, while it offers the advantage of additionally providing an estimation of SOX17 promoter methylation levels.",2.824,456

Thus, we used the rat model of acute restraint stress (ARS) to evaluate the impact of stress on the global DNA methylation and on the expression of the Dnmt1 and Bdnf genes of hippocampus, cortex, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Furthermore, we verified the potential of physical exercise to modulate epigenetic responses evoked by ARS. Sedentary male Wistar rats were submitted to ARS at the 75th postnatal day (PND), whereas animals from a physically active group were previously submitted to swimming sessions (35-74th PND) and to ARS at the 75th PND. Global DNA methylation profile was quantified using an ELISA-based method and the quantitative expression of the Dnmt1 and Bdnf genes was evaluated by real-time PCR. ARS induced a decrease in global DNA methylation in hippocampus, cortex and PAG of sedentary animals and an increased expression of Bdnf in PAG. No change in DNA methylation was associated with ARS in the exercised animals, although it was associated with abnormal expression of Dnmt1 and Bdnf in cortex, hypothalamus and PAG. Our data reveal that ARS evokes adaptive changes in global DNA methylation of rat brain that are independent of the expression of the Dnmt1 gene but might be linked to abnormal expression of the Bdnf gene in the PAG. Furthermore, our evidence indicates that physical exercise has the potential to modulate changes in DNA methylation and gene expression consequent to ARS.",3.028,664

There is a need for specific molecular markers that can be used in combination with PSA to improve the specificity of PSA screening. We examined GADD45a methylation in blood DNA as a molecular marker for prostate cancer diagnosis. METHODS: The study included 82 men, with PSA levels >4 ng ml(-1) and/or abnormal digital rectal exam, who underwent prostate biopsy. We compared GADD45a methylation in DNA from serum and buffy coat in 44 patients (22 prostate cancer and 22 benign). GADD45a methylation in serum DNA was examined in 82 patients (34 cancer and 48 benign). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in buffy coat GADD45a methylation between cancer and benign patients. Serum GADD45a methylation was significantly higher in cancer than in benign patients. Classification and regression tree predictive model for prostate cancer including risk groups defined by PSA, free circulating DNA (fcDNA) level and GADD45a methylation yielded specificity of 87.5%, sensitivity of 94.1% and receiver operator characteristic curve area of 0.937.

This study sought to determine if folate influences the methylation level of cytosine-guanine (CpG) islands in the promoters of critical adipogenic genes in chickens, and how this might affect gene expression and differentiation of preadipocytes in vitro. Preadipocytes were treated with 0 to 16 mg/L of folate during the induction of differentiation, and cell proliferation and lipid accumulation were assessed. The folate supplementation resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and decreased content of lipid per adipocyte at d 6 of differentiation. The effects of folate on relative expression of genes critical for adipocyte differentiation and 1-carbon metabolism were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Folate caused a dose-dependent decrease in transcript abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) gene expression, and the downstream enzyme fatty acid synthase; in contrast, expression of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was obviously upregulated at d 6 of differentiation (P < 0.05). The DNA methylation was examined with the bisulfite sequencing PCR method. Overall CpG methylation in the C/EBPalpha gene promoter region was 21.8% lower (P < 0.05) and the gene's expression was 2.7-fold higher in the absence of folate, compared with cells treated with 16 mg/L of folate, whereas methylation of the PPARgamma promoter was not affected. Overall, the results show that folate increased the proliferation of adipocytes but reduced per-cell lipid accumulation, thereby influencing differentiation; it increased expression of genes involved in 1-carbon metabolism resulting in greater methylation of the C/EBPalpha promoter during differentiation and decreased that gene's expression, perhaps accounting for decreased expression of PPARgamma.",1.672,254

Aberrant DNA methylation has been linked to many of these diseases and is associated with gene expression; however, the functional similarities and differences between porcine and human DNA methylation patterns are largely unknown. METHODS: DNA and RNA was isolated from eight tissue samples (fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle, and spleen) from the adult female Duroc utilized for the pig genome sequencing project. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq were performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000. RRBS reads were aligned using BSseeker2, and only sites with a minimum depth of 10 reads were used for methylation analysis. RNA-seq reads were aligned using Tophat, and expression analysis was performed using Cufflinks. In addition, SNP calling was performed using GATK for targeted control and whole genome sequencing reads for CpG site validation and allelic expression analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Analysis on the influence of DNA variation in methylation calling revealed a reduced effectiveness of WGS datasets in covering CpG rich regions, as well as the usefulness of a targeted control library for SNP detection. Analysis of over 500,000 CpG sites demonstrated genome wide methylation patterns similar to those observed in humans, including reduced methylation within CpG islands and at transcription start sites (TSS), X chromosome inactivation, and anticorrelation of TSS CpG methylation with gene expression. In addition, a positive correlation between TSS CpG density and expression, and a negative correlation between TSS TpG density and expression were demonstrated. Low but non-random non-CpG methylation (<1%) was also detected in all non-neuronal somatic tissues, with differences in tissue clustering observed based on CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns. Finally, allele specific expression analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in metabolic and regulatory processes. DISCUSSION: These results provide transcriptional and DNA methylation datasets for the biomedical community that are directly relatable to current genomic resources. In addition, the correlation between TSS CpG density and expression suggests increased mutation rates at CpG sites play a significant role in adaptive evolution by reducing CpG density at TSS over time, resulting in higher methylation levels in these regions and more permanent changes to lower gene expression. This is proposed to occur predominantly through deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymidine, resulting in the replacement of CpG with TpG sites in these regions, as indicated by the increased TSS TpG density observed in non-expressed genes, resulting in a negative correlation between expression and TSS TpG density. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides baseline methylation and gene transcription profiles for a healthy adult pig, reports similar patterns to those observed in humans, and supports future porcine studies related to human disease and development. Additionally, the observed reduced CpG and increased TpG density at TSS of lowly expressed genes suggests DNA methylation plays a significant role in adaptive evolution through more permanent changes to lower gene expression.",3.986,292

LCMT1 and PME-1 have been linked to the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. We show here an important role for an LCMT1-PME-1 methylation equilibrium in controlling mitotic spindle size. Depletion of LCMT1 or overexpression of PME-1 led to long spindles. In contrast, depletion of PME-1, pharmacological inhibition of PME-1 or overexpression of LCMT1 led to short spindles. Furthermore, perturbation of the LCMT1-PME-1 methylation equilibrium led to mitotic arrest, spindle assembly checkpoint activation, defective cell divisions, induction of apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Thus, we propose that the LCMT1-PME-1 methylation equilibrium is critical for regulating mitotic spindle size and thereby proper cell division.",0,248

Forty-five patients who underwent an esophagectomy for ESCC were allocated to either a treatment group (n=22) or a control group (n=23). Patients in the treatment group were administered 800 mg/day of celecoxib for 14 days before surgery. Patients in the control group did not take any type of NSAID. Biopsies of the tumor were collected before surgery and tissue from the resection specimens after surgery. Methylation-specific PCR was used to measure DNA methylation and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with methylation for each of the genes between the patient groups before treatment. In those patients with pretreatment methylation, there was a significant reduction in the proportion with methylation and a significant increase in the corresponding messenger RNA expression after treatment with celecoxib. In those tissues in which there was a reduction in methylation following celecoxib treatment, there was a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells, but not in the tissues with no change in methylation. In ESCC, in-vivo treatment with celecoxib is associated with a reduction in DNA methylation and increase in messenger RNA expression of tumor-suppressor genes, and increases in apoptosis.",1.784,899

METHODS: Cytosine methylation within the gene encoding for FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) was measured in Holocaust survivors (n = 32), their adult offspring (n = 22), and demographically comparable parent (n = 8) and offspring (n = 9) control subjects, respectively. Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites for analysis were chosen based on their spatial proximity to the intron 7 glucocorticoid response elements. RESULTS: Holocaust exposure had an effect on FKBP5 methylation that was observed in exposed parents as well in their offspring. These effects were observed at bin 3/site 6. Interestingly, in Holocaust survivors, methylation at this site was higher in comparison with control subjects, whereas in Holocaust offspring, methylation was lower. Methylation levels for exposed parents and their offspring were significantly correlated. In contrast to the findings at bin 3/site 6, offspring methylation at bin 2/sites 3 to 5 was associated with childhood physical and sexual abuse in interaction with an FKBP5 risk allele previously associated with vulnerability to psychological consequences of childhood adversity. The findings suggest the possibility of site specificity to environmental influences, as sites in bins 3 and 2 were differentially associated with parental trauma and the offspring's own childhood trauma, respectively. FKBP5 methylation averaged across the three bins examined was associated with wake-up cortisol levels, indicating functional relevance of the methylation measures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of an association of preconception parental trauma with epigenetic alterations that is evident in both exposed parent and offspring, providing potential insight into how severe psychophysiological trauma can have intergenerational effects.",10.255,804

METHODS: Analysis of THRbeta promoter methylation was performed on 85 pairs of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples as cases and controls via methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR [MSP]). The samples were obtained from tumors and surrounding healthy tissues from resected gastric cancers. The expression assay was also performed with 25 FFPE tissue pairs (tumor and surrounding healthy tissues of the same individual) using real-time PCR. RESULTS: The results of the present study show that there is a statistically significant difference between tumor and adjacent normal tissues regarding promoter methylation status and THRbeta expression (P = 0.04 and P = 0.036, respectively).

Estrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) leads to a relief of typical menopausal symptoms, benefits bone and muscle health, and is associated with tissue-specific gene expression profiles. As gene expression is controlled by epigenetic factors (including DNA methylation), many of which are environmentally sensitive, it is plausible that at least part of the HRT-associated gene expression is due to changes in DNA methylation profile. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns of white blood cells (WBCs) and their associations with body composition, including muscle and bone measures of monozygotic (MZ) female twin pairs discordant for HRT. We identified 7,855 nominally significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with 4,044 genes. Of the genes with DMRs, five (ACBA1, CCL5, FASLG, PPP2R2B, and UHRF1) were also differentially expressed. All have been previously associated with HRT or estrogenic regulation, but not with HRT-associated DNA methylation. All five genes were associated with bone mineral content (BMC), and ABCA1, FASLG, and UHRF1 were also associated with body adiposity. Our study is the first to show that HRT associates with genome-wide DNA methylation alterations in WBCs. Moreover, we show that five differentially expressed genes with DMRs associate with clinical measures, including body fat percentage, lean body mass, bone mass, and blood lipids. Our results indicate that at least part of the known beneficial HRT effects on body composition and bone mass may be regulated by DNA methylation associated alterations in gene expression in circulating WBCs.",2.297,1902

Early-life diet also associates with DNA methylation of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (IGF2), involved in fetal and neural development. We investigated the degree to which prenatal high-fat and -sugar diet might relate to ADHD symptoms via IGF2 DNA methylation for early-onset persistent (EOP) versus low CP youth. METHODS: Participants were 164 youth with EOP (n = 83) versus low (n = 81) CP drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We assessed if the interrelationships between high-fat and -sugar diet (prenatal, postnatal), IGF2 methylation (birth and age 7, collected from blood), and ADHD symptoms (age 7-13) differed for EOP versus low CP youth. RESULTS: Prenatal 'unhealthy diet' was positively associated with IGF2 methylation at birth for both the EOP and low CP youth. For EOP only: (a) higher IGF2 methylation predicted ADHD symptoms; and (b) prenatal 'unhealthy diet' was associated with higher ADHD symptoms indirectly via higher IGF2 methylation.

However, dynamic expression patterns of histone methylation involved in epigenetic reprogramming progression during porcine SCNT embryo early development remain to be unknown. In this study, we characterized and compared the expression patterns of multiple histone methylation markers including transcriptionally repressive (H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, H4K20me2 and H4K20me3) and active modifications (H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K36me2, H3K36me3, H3K79me2 and H3K79me3) in SCNT early embryos from different developmental stages with that from in vitro fertilization (IVF) counterparts. We found that the expression level of H3K9me2, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 of SCNT embryos from 1-cell to 4-cell stages was significantly higher than that in the IVF embryos. We also detected a symmetric distribution pattern of H3K9me2 between inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) in SCNT blastocysts. The expression level of H3K9me2 in both lineages from SCNT expanded blastocyst onwards was significantly higher than that in IVF counterparts.

25719248,Mitochondrial DNA copy number is regulated by DNA methylation and demethylation of POLGA in stem and cancer cells and their differentiated progeny.,"['Lee W', 'Johnson J', 'Gough DJ', 'Donoghue J', 'Cagnone GL', 'Vaghjiani V', 'Brown KA', 'Johns TG', 'St John JC']",Cell death & disease,2015,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number is strictly regulated during differentiation so that cells with a high requirement for ATP generated through oxidative phosphorylation have high mtDNA copy number, whereas those with a low requirement have few copies. Using immunoprecipitation of DNA methylation on 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which distinguish between de novo DNA methylation and demethylation, respectively, we set out to determine whether DNA methylation at exon 2 of the human mtDNA-specific polymerase (DNA polymerase gamma A (POLGA)) regulates cell-specific mtDNA copy number in highly proliferative and terminally differentiated cells. Highly proliferative cancer and pluripotent and multipotent cells possessed low mtDNA copy number and were highly methylated at exon 2 of POLGA in contrast to post-mitotic cells. Unlike neural stem cells, cancer cells were unable to differentiate and remained extensively DNA methylated at exon 2 of POLGA. However, mtDNA depletion of cancer cells reduced DNA methylation at exon 2 of POLGA as they replenished mtDNA to form tumours in mice. Glioblastoma cells treated with the DNA demethylation agent 5-azacytidine over 28 days of astrocyte-induced differentiation demethylated exon 2 of POLGA leading to increased mtDNA copy number and expression of the astrocyte endpoint marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). However, the demethylation agent vitamin C (VitC) was unable to sustain increased mtDNA copy number and differentiation, as was the case when VitC was withdrawn after short-term treatment. These data demonstrate that DNA demethylation of POLGA is an essential regulator of mtDNA copy number and cellular fate and that cancer cells are only able to modulate DNA methylation of POLGA and mtDNA copy number in the presence of a DNA demethylation agent that inhibits de novo methyltransferase 1 activity.",5.014,1473

 chemicals",2015,"Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine antiplatelet prodrug, is metabolized by oxidation to 2-oxo-clopidogrel, followed by conversion to its pharmacologically active thiol metabolite. After oral administration of clopidogrel to humans, two thiol isomers (H3 and H4) are observed in plasma, with similar concentrations, and only H4 is active in humans. In this work, the mechanism of stereoselectivity in the formation and S-methylation of H3 and H4 was investigated in vitro. The two diastereomers of 2-oxo-clopidogrel were epimerized rapidly at physiologic pH. The intrinsic clearance (CLint) for H3 formation from 2-oxo-clopidogrel in human liver microsomes (HLMs) was 3.1-fold higher than that for H4 formation, indicating stereoselective metabolism. Kinetic studies using expressed enzymes demonstrated that the contributions of CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to the formation of H4 from 2-oxo-clopidogrel were 18.5%, 26.1%, and 53.5%, respectively. The CLint ratios of H3 formation to H4 formation from 2-oxo-clopidogrel by CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 were 2.2, 1.0, and 1.7, respectively. In HLMs, H3 and H4 were further S-methylated, and the S-methylation was inhibited by 2,3-dichloromethyl benzylamine, indicating the involvement of thiol S-methyltransferase. The CLint value for the S-methylation of H3 in HLMs was 98.1-fold higher than that for H4. The stereoselective formation of H3 from 2-oxo-clopidogrel and the stereoselective S-methylation of H3 may lead to the similar exposure levels of H3 and H4 previously reported in humans. The epimerization of 2-oxo-clopidogrel and the variations of thiol S-methyltransferase may affect the exposure to H4 in humans.",5.356,139

It is not clear, however, whether these changes are causative or result from illness progression or treatment. To disentangle these possibilities we profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in well, unrelated individuals at high familial risk of mood disorder. DNA methylation was compared between individuals who subsequently developed BD or MDD [ill later (IL)] and those who remained well [well later (WL)]. METHODS: DNA methylation profiles were obtained from whole-blood samples from 22 IL and 23 WL individuals using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Differential methylation was assessed on a single-locus and regional basis. Pathway analysis was performed to assess enrichment for particular biological processes amongst nominally significantly differentially methylated loci. RESULTS: Although no locus withstood correction for multiple testing, uncorrected P-values provided suggestive evidence for altered methylation at sites within genes previously implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) and Interleukin 1 Receptor Accessory Protein-Like 1 ([IL1RAPL1]; P</=3.11x10-5 ). Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment for several neurologically relevant pathways and functions, including Nervous System Development and Function and Behavior; these findings withstood multiple testing correction (q</=0.05). Analysis of differentially methylated regions identified several within the major histocompatibility complex (P</=.000 479), a region previously implicated in schizophrenia and BD. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide provisional evidence for the involvement of altered whole-blood DNA methylation in neurologically relevant genes in the aetiology of mood disorders. These findings are convergent with the findings of genome-wide association studies.",4.965,560

Variations in the intake of maternal nutrients affecting one-carbon metabolism may influence brain development and exert long-term effects on the health of the progeny. In this study, we investigated whether supplementation with high maternal folic acid during gestation alters DNA methylation and gene expression in the cerebellum of mouse offspring. We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to analyze the DNA methylation profile at the single-base resolution level. The genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed that supplementation with higher maternal folic acid resulted in distinct methylation patterns (P < 0.05) of CpG and non-CpG sites in the cerebellum of offspring. Such variations of methylation and gene expression in the cerebellum of offspring were highly sex-specific, including several genes of the neuronal pathways. These findings demonstrate that alterations in the level of maternal folic acid during gestation can influence methylation and gene expression in the cerebellum of offspring. Such changes in the offspring epigenome may alter neurodevelopment and influence the functional outcome of neurologic and psychiatric diseases.",3.656,1754

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We profiled the DNA methylomes of human symptomatic carotid plaques obtained from patients who had cerebrovascular events (n=19) and asymptomatic counterparts (n=19) with a high-density microarray ( approximately 485 000 CpG sites, Illumina), and crossed DNA methylation data with RNAseq-based expression data from an independent symptomatic carotid plaque set (n=8). Few (30) CpGs showed a significant (P<0.05; absolute Delta-Beta, >0.20) differential methylation between the 2 groups. Within symptomatic carotid plaques, DNA methylation correlated significantly with postcerebrovascular event time (range, 3-45 days; r-value range, -0.926 to 0.857; P<0.05) for  approximately 45 000 CpGs, the vast majority of which became hypomethylated with increasing postcerebrovascular event time. Hypomethylation was not due to erasure of the gene-body and CG-poor region hypermethylation that accompany the progression of stable lesions, but rather targeted promoters and CpG islands. Noticeably, promoter hypomethylation and increased expression of genes involved in the inhibition of the inflammatory response, defense against oxidative stress, and active DNA demethylation were observed with increasing postcerebrovascular event time. Concomitantly, histological changes consistent with phagocyte-driven plaque healing were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Weak changes in the DNA methylome distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic plaques, but a widespread demethylation resulting in permissive transcriptional marks at atheroprotective gene promoters is established in plaques after a cerebrovascular event, thus mirroring previous observations that ruptured plaques tend to revert to a stable structure. The identified loci are candidate targets to accelerate the pace of carotid plaque stabilization.",6.0,677

Damaged DNA is less liable to DNA methylation, and antioxidant therapy appears to have the potential to reduce sperm oxidative stress and DNA damage and thereby maintain DNA methylation, while effect of varicocelectomy on DNA methylation patterns has remained unclear. In the light of these considerations, we aimed to examine the effect of varicocelectomy on sperm DNA methylation and functional characteristics. Fifty-two men with left-sided varicocele (grade II &III) were included. Sperm parameters, DNA fragmentation, protamine deficiency, oxidative stress and global DNA methylation were evaluated before and 3 months after surgery. Our data show that sperm concentration, percentages of spermatozoon with abnormal morphology, DNA fragmentation, protamine deficiency and oxidative stress significantly improved after surgery. Percentage of sperm motility, global DNA methylation and intensity of DNA methylation also improved after surgery, although the differences were not significant when compared with before surgery. Categorisation of individuals to subgroups revealed that improvement of DNA methylation appears to take place in oligozoospermic individuals, which are more severely affected by state of varicocele. However, this is a preliminary study, and further studies are required to solidify this conclusion.",1.63,157

It has become apparent that intracellular epigenetic modification including DNA methylation is deeply involved in fate specification of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, it is still unclear whether the Notch pathway regulates hippocampal neurogenesis by changing the Notch genes' DNA methylation status. Here, we present the evidence from DNA methylation profiling of Notch1, Hes1 and Ngn2 promoters during neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of postnatal, adult and traumatic brains. We observed the expression of Notch1, Hes1 and Ngn2 in hippocampal DG with qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, we investigated the methylation status of Notch pathway genes using the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) method. The number of Notch1 or Hes1 (+) and BrdU (+) cells decreased in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG in the hippocampus following TBI. Nevertheless, the number of Ngn2-positive cells in the DG of injured mice was markedly higher than in the DG of non-TBI mice. Accordingly, the DNA methylation level of the three gene promoters changed with their expression in the DG. These findings suggest that the strict spatio-temporal expression of Notch effector genes plays an important role during hippocampal neurogenesis and suggests the possibility that Notch1, Hes1 and Ngn2 were regulated by changing some specific CpG sites of their promoters to further orchestrate neurogenesis in vivo.",2.718,709

Epigenetic modification of stress reactivity genes is a likely mechanism contributing to this risk. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene is of particular interest because of the regulatory role of the GR in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Mounting evidence suggests that early adversity is associated with GR promoter methylation and gene expression. Few studies have examined links between GR promoter methylation and psychopathology, and findings to date have been mixed. Healthy adult participants (N=340) who were free of psychotropic medications reported on their childhood experiences of maltreatment and parental death and desertion. Lifetime depressive and anxiety disorders and past substance-use disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Methylation of exon 1F of the GR gene (NR3C1) was examined in leukocyte DNA via pyrosequencing. On a separate day, a subset of the participants (n=231) completed the dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (Dex/CRH) test. Childhood adversity and a history of past substance-use disorder and current or past depressive or anxiety disorders were associated with lower levels of NR3C1 promoter methylation across the region as a whole and at individual CpG sites (P<0.05). The number of adversities was negatively associated with NR3C1 methylation in participants with no lifetime disorder (P=0.018), but not in those with a lifetime disorder. GR promoter methylation was linked to altered cortisol responses to the Dex/CRH test (P<0.05). This study presents evidence of reduced methylation of NR3C1 in association with childhood maltreatment and depressive, anxiety and substance-use disorders in adults. This finding stands in contrast to our prior work, but is consistent with emerging findings, suggesting complexity in the regulation of this gene.",5.62,1400

Diabetes & endocrinology,2015,"BACKGROUND: Indian Asians, who make up a quarter of the world's population, are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether DNA methylation is associated with future type 2 diabetes incidence in Indian Asians and whether differences in methylation patterns between Indian Asians and Europeans are associated with, and could be used to predict, differences in the magnitude of risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a nested case-control study of DNA methylation in Indian Asians and Europeans with incident type 2 diabetes who were identified from the 8-year follow-up of 25 372 participants in the London Life Sciences Prospective Population (LOLIPOP) study. Patients were recruited between May 1, 2002, and Sept 12, 2008. We did epigenome-wide association analysis using samples from Indian Asians with incident type 2 diabetes and age-matched and sex-matched Indian Asian controls, followed by replication testing of top-ranking signals in Europeans. For both discovery and replication, DNA methylation was measured in the baseline blood sample, which was collected before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Epigenome-wide significance was set at p<1 x 10(-7). We compared methylation levels between Indian Asian and European controls without type 2 diabetes at baseline to estimate the potential contribution of DNA methylation to increased risk of future type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian Asians. FINDINGS: 1608 (11.9%) of 13 535 Indian Asians and 306 (4.3%) of 7066 Europeans developed type 2 diabetes over a mean of 8.5 years (SD 1.8) of follow-up. The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes was 3.1 times (95% CI 2.8-3.6; p<0.0001) higher among Indian Asians than among Europeans, and remained 2.5 times (2.1-2.9; p<0.0001) higher after adjustment for adiposity, physical activity, family history of type 2 diabetes, and baseline glycaemic measures. The mean absolute difference in methylation level between type 2 diabetes cases and controls ranged from 0.5% (SD 0.1) to 1.1% (0.2). Methylation markers at five loci were associated with future type 2 diabetes incidence; the relative risk per 1% increase in methylation was 1.09 (95% CI 1.07-1.11; p=1.3 x 10(-17)) for ABCG1, 0.94 (0.92-0.95; p=4.2 x 10(-11)) for PHOSPHO1, 0.94 (0.92-0.96; p=1.4 x 10(-9)) for SOCS3, 1.07 (1.04-1.09; p=2.1 x 10(-10)) for SREBF1, and 0.92 (0.90-0.94; p=1.2 x 10(-17)) for TXNIP. A methylation score combining results for the five loci was associated with future type 2 diabetes incidence (relative risk quartile 4 vs quartile 1 3.51, 95% CI 2.79-4.42; p=1.3 x 10(-26)), and was independent of established risk factors. Methylation score was higher among Indian Asians than Europeans (p=1 x 10(-34)).

The accumulating evidences indicate that DNA methylation patterns change with age. Aging resembles a developmentally regulated process that is tightly controlled by specific epigenetic modifications and age-associated methylation changes exist in human genome. In this study, three age-related methylation fragments were isolated and identified in blood of 40 donors. Age-related methylation changes with each fragment was validated and replicated in a general population sample of 65 donors over a wide age range (11-72 years). Methylation of these fragments is linearly correlated with age over a range of six decades (r = 0.80-0.88). Using average methylation of CpG sites of three fragments, a regression model that explained 95 % of the variance in age was built and is able to predict an individual's age with great accuracy (R (2 )= 0.93). The predicted value is highly correlated with the observed age in the sample (r = 0.96) and has great accuracy of average 4 years difference between predicted age and true age. This study implicates that DNA methylation can be an available biological marker of age-prediction. Further measurement of relevant markers in the genome could be a tool in routine screening to predict age of forensic biological samples.",2.714,887

The methylation of CpG islands by DNA methyltransferases is reversible and has been shown to modify the transcriptional activity of key proliferation genes or transcription factors involved in suppression or promotion of cell growth. Indeed, aberrant methylation found in gene promoters is a hallmark of cancer that could be used as non-intrusive biomarker in body fluids such as blood and plasma for early detection of breast cancer. Many biomarker genes have been evaluated for breast cancer detection. However, in the absence of a unique biomarker having the sufficient specificity and sensitivity, a panel of multiple genes should be used. Treatments targeting aberrant methylation by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which trigger re-expression of silenced genes, are now available and allow for better treatment efficiency.",1.826,591

DNA methylation is commonly regarded as a significant regulator that differs across cells and tissues. In this study, we comprehensively reviewed research progress on estimating of tumour heterogeneity. Bioinformatics-based analysis of DNA methylation has revealed the evolutionary relationships between breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Further analysis of the DNA methylation profiles in 33 breast cancer-related cell lines identified cell line-specific methylation patterns. Next, we reviewed the computational methods in inferring clonal evolution of tumours from different perspectives and then proposed a deconvolution strategy for modelling cell subclonal populations dynamics in breast cancer tissues based on DNA methylation. Further analysis of simulated cancer tissues and real cell lines revealed that this approach exhibits satisfactory performance and relative stability in estimating the composition and proportions of cellular subpopulations. The application of this strategy to breast cancer individuals of the Cancer Genome Atlas's identified different cellular subpopulations with distinct molecular phenotypes. Moreover, the current and potential future applications of this deconvolution strategy to clinical breast cancer research are discussed, and emphasis was placed on the DNA methylation-based recognition of intra-tumour heterogeneity. The wide use of these methods for estimating heterogeneity to further clinical cohorts will improve our understanding of neoplastic progression and the design of therapeutic interventions for treating breast cancer and other malignancies.",9.617,1488

However, the association between CDH1 promoter methylation and ovarian cancer remains unclear. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential role of CDH1 promoter methylation in ovarian cancer. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified by searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI and Wanfang databases. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the strength of association. RESULTS: Nine studies were performed using the fixed-effects model in this study, including 485 cancer tissues and 255 nonmalignant tissues. The findings showed that CDH1 promoter methylation had an increased risk of ovarian cancer in cancer tissues (OR = 8.71, P < 0.001) in comparison with nonmalignant tissues. Subgroup analysis of the ethnicity showed that the OR value of CDH1 methylation in Asian population subgroup (OR = 13.20, P < 0.001) was higher than that in Caucasian population subgroup (OR = 3.84, P = 0.005). No significant association was found between ovarian cancer and low malignant potential (LMP) tumor (P = 0.096) among 2 studies, and between CDH1 promoter methylation and tumor stage and tumor histology (all P > 0.05). There was not any evidence of publication bias by Egger's test (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CDH1 promoter methylation can be a potential biomarker in ovarian cancer risk prediction, especially Asians can be more susceptible to CDH1 methylation.

We first revealed a negative correlation between the level of the miR-129-2 precursor and RASSF1(A) and GPX1 mRNA levels in BC (Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) was - 0.26 in both cases). Similar results were observed for the miR-129-2 precursor and the RASSF1(A), GPX1, RARB(2), and CHL1 genes in OC (rs was in the range - 0.48 to - 0.54). Using methylation-specific PCR, a significant correlation was shown between promoter hypermethylation and the down-regulation of the RASSF1(A), GPX1, RARB(2), SEMA3B, MIR-129-2, and MIR-9-1 genes in BC (rs = 0.41 to 0.75) and of the RASSF1(A) gene in OC (rs = 0.67). We first demonstrated a high hypermethylation frequency of MIR-129-2 and SEMA3B (up to 45 to 48%) in both BC (69 samples) and OC (41 samples). Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between the hypermethylation of MIR-129-2 and the up-regulation of the RASSF1(A) and GPX1 genes in BC (rs = 0.38 and 0.42, respectively). QPCR analysis of the expression of RASSF1(A) and mature miR-129-2 in additional BC sample set (24 samples) revealed a negative correlation between them (rs = - 0.41) that strengthened the results obtained during the analysis of miR-129-2 precursor level. In summary, the obtained data indicate the involvement of methylation in the down-regulation of the studied coding and miRNA genes and suggest the involvement of miR-129-2 in the deregulation of RASSF1(A) via a direct interaction or/and mediators in common pathways (according to KEGG, Gene Ontology (FDR < 0.01), and GeneCards data) in the examined gynecological tumors.",2.138,602

In total, 302 adults (79 arsenicosis and 223 non-arsenicosis) residing in an endemic arsenism area in Huhhot Basin were included. Urinary levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were determined, and the percentages of arsenic species (iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%), as well as two methylation indices (primary methylation index, PMI, and secondary methylation index, SMI), were calculated to assess the arsenic methylation capacity of individuals. The results showed that a lower methylation capacity, which is indicated by higher MMA% values and lower DMA% and SMI values, was significantly associated with arsenicosis after the adjustment for multiple confounders. The relative excess risk for interactions between higher MMA% values and older age was 2.35 (95% CI: -0.56, 5.27), and the relative excess risk for interactions between higher MMA% values and lower BMI was 1.08 (95% CI: -1.20, 3.36). The data also indicated a suggestive synergistic effect of a lower arsenic methylation capacity (lower DMA% and SMI) with older age, lower BMI, and male gender. The findings of the present study suggest that a lower arsenic methylation capacity was associated with arsenicosis and that certain risk factors may enhance the risk of arsenic-induced skin lesions.",4.373,310

The present study investigated the promoter methylation status of the SEPT9 gene in peripheral blood samples of subjects' positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT). In order to add new insights, we investigated the association between SEPT9 promoter methylation and micronuclei frequency, and polymorphisms in the folate-related pathway genes. SEPT9 promoter methylation, micronuclei frequency, and genotypes were evaluated on 74 individuals' FOBT positive. Individuals were subjected to a colonoscopy that provided written informed consent for study participation. SEPT9 promoter methylation status was significantly lower in the CRC group than controls (p = 0.0006). In contrast, the CaCo2 cell-line, analyzed as a tissue specific model of colon adenocarcinoma, showed a significantly higher percentage of SEPT9 promoter methylation compared to the CRC group (p < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between micronuclei frequency and the decrease in the methylation levels of SEPT9 promoter region among CRC patients (beta = -0.926, p = 0.0001). With regard to genotype analysis, we showed the involvement of the DHFR polymorphism (rs70991108) in SEPT9 promoter methylation level in CRC patients only. In particular, the presence of at least one 19 bp del allele significantly correlates with decreased SEPT9 promoter methylation, compared to the 19 bp ins/ins genotype (p = 0.007). While remaining aware of the strengths and limitations of the study, this represents the first evidence of a novel approach for the early detection of CRC, using SEPT9 promoter methylation, micronuclei frequency and genotypes, with the potential to improve CRC risk assessment.",2.862,1455

The RS and RR isomers are more active than the SS and SR isomers (RS > RR > > SR = SS). The pharmacologically active metabolite is further metabolized to an S-methylated metabolite that is the major identified inactive metabolite in humans. In rat, dog, and human liver microsomes supplemented with S-adenosyl methione, the SS and SR isomers of the active metabolite were extensively S-methylated while the RS and RR isomers were not. Addition of 2,3-dichloromethyl benzylamine (50 microM) completely inhibited the S-methylation reaction, indicating that the microsomal and cytosolic thiol methyltransferase but not the cytosolic thiopurine S-methyltransferase is involved in the methylation. The hepatic intrinsic clearance values for methylation of the RS, RR, SS, and SR isomers (ml/min/kg) were 0, 0, 40.4, and 37.6, respectively, in rat liver microsomes, 0, 0, 11.6, and 2.5, respectively, in dog liver microsomes, and 0, 0, 17.3, and 17.7, respectively, in human liver microsomes, indicating that the RS and RR isomers are not methylated in vitro and that the methylation of SS and SR isomers is high with rat > human > dog. This finding in vitro agreed well with the in vivo observation in rats and dogs, where the S-methylated SS and SR isomers were the major metabolites in the plasma whereas negligible amounts of S-methylated RS and RR isomers were detected after intravenous administration of the pharmacologically active metabolites.",5.356,1718

Progress in understanding the aetiology of BD has been hampered by substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. We sought to mitigate these confounders by studying a multi-generational family multiply affected by BD and major depressive disorder (MDD), who carry an illness-linked haplotype on chromosome 4p. Within a family, aetiological heterogeneity is likely to be reduced, thus conferring greater power to detect illness-related changes. As accumulating evidence suggests that altered DNA methylation confers risk for BD and MDD, we compared genome-wide methylation between (i) affected carriers of the linked haplotype (ALH) and married-in controls (MIs), (ii) well unaffected haplotype carriers (ULH) and MI, (iii) ALH and ULH and (iv) all haplotype carriers (LH) and MI. RESULTS: Nominally significant differences in DNA methylation were observed in all comparisons, with differences withstanding correction for multiple testing when the ALH or LH group was compared to the MIs. In both comparisons, we observed increased methylation at a locus in FANCI, which was accompanied by increased FANCI expression in the ALH group. FANCI is part of the Fanconi anaemia complementation (FANC) gene family, which are mutated in Fanconi anaemia and participate in DNA repair. Interestingly, several FANC genes have been implicated in psychiatric disorders. Regional analyses of methylation differences identified loci implicated in psychiatric illness by genome-wide association studies, including CACNB2 and the major histocompatibility complex. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for methylation differences in neurologically relevant genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight altered DNA methylation as a potential mechanism by which the linked haplotype might confer risk for mood disorders. Differences in the phenotypic outcome of haplotype carriers might, in part, arise from additional changes in DNA methylation that converge on neurologically important pathways. Further work is required to investigate the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of the observed differences in methylation.",4.543,94

Several factors regulate DNA methylation in early embryogenesis, but their precise role in the establishment of DNA methylation at a given site remains unclear. We have generated a comprehensive methylation map in fibroblasts derived from the murine DNA methylation mutant Hells(-/-) (helicase, lymphoid specific, also known as LSH). It has been previously shown that HELLS can influence de novo methylation of retroviral sequences and endogenous genes. Here, we describe that HELLS controls cytosine methylation in a nuclear compartment that is in part defined by lamin B1 attachment regions. Despite widespread loss of cytosine methylation at regulatory sequences, including promoter regions of protein-coding genes and noncoding RNA genes, overall relative transcript abundance levels in the absence of HELLS are similar to those in wild-type cells. A subset of promoter regions shows increases of the histone modification H3K27me3, suggesting redundancy of epigenetic silencing mechanisms. Furthermore, HELLS modulates CG methylation at all classes of repeat elements and is critical for repression of a subset of repeat elements. Overall, we provide a detailed analysis of gene expression changes in relation to DNA methylation alterations, which contributes to our understanding of the biological role of cytosine methylation.",14.63,1715

We report a pilot study quantifying gene expression and methylation profile consistency over time, addressing the reasons for individual uniqueness, and its relation to N = 1 phenotypes. METHODS: Whole blood samples from four African American women, four Caucasian women, and four Caucasian men drawn from the Atlanta Center for Health Discovery and Well Being study at three successive 6-month intervals were profiled by RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, and Illumina Methylation 450 K arrays. Standard regression approaches were used to evaluate the proportion of variance for each type of omic measure among individuals, and to quantify correlations among measures and with clinical attributes related to wellness. RESULTS: Longitudinal omic profiles were in general highly consistent over time, with an average of 67 % variance in transcript abundance, 42 % in CpG methylation level (but 88 % for the most differentiated CpG per gene), and 50 % in miRNA abundance among individuals, which are all comparable to 74 % variance among individuals for 74 clinical traits. One third of the variance could be attributed to differential blood cell type abundance, which was also fairly stable over time, and a lesser amount to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects. Seven conserved axes of covariance that capture diverse aspects of immune function explained over half of the variance. These axes also explained a considerable proportion of individually extreme transcript abundance, namely approximately 100 genes that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in each person and were in some cases enriched for relevant gene activities that plausibly associate with clinical attributes. A similar fraction of genes had individually divergent methylation levels, but these did not overlap with the transcripts, and fewer than 20 % of genes had significantly correlated methylation and gene expression.

We hypothesized that changes in gene methylation is involved in the prenatal maturation of the intestine and its response to the first days of formula feeding, potentially leading to NEC in preterm pigs used as models for preterm infants. RESULTS: Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was used to assess if changes in intestinal DNA methylation are associated with formula-induced NEC outbreak and advancing age from 10 days before birth to 4 days after birth. Selected key genes with differentially methylated gene regions (DMRs) between groups were further validated by HiSeq-based bisulfite sequencing PCR and RT-qPCR to assess methylation and expression levels. Consistent with the maturation of many intestinal functions in the perinatal period, methylation level of most genes decreased with advancing pre- and postnatal age. The highest number of DMRs was identified between the newborn and 4 d-old preterm pigs. There were few intestinal DMR differences between unaffected pigs and pigs with initial evidence of NEC. In the 4 d-old formula-fed preterm pigs, four genes associated with intestinal metabolism (CYP2W1, GPR146, TOP1MT, CEND1) showed significant hyper-methylation in their promoter CGIs, and thus, down-regulated transcription. Methylation-driven down-regulation of such genes may predispose the immature intestine to later metabolic dysfunctions and severe NEC lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and postnatal changes in intestinal DNA methylation may contribute to high NEC sensitivity in preterm neonates. Optimizing gene methylation changes via environmental stimuli (e.g. diet, nutrition, gut microbiota), may help to make immature newborn infants more resistant to gut dysfunctions, both short and long term.",3.986,1991

Genetics,2016,"Establishing the age of unknown persons, or persons with unknown age, can provide important leads in police investigations, disaster victim identification, fraud cases, and in other legal affairs. Previous methods mostly relied on morphological features available from teeth or skeletal parts. The development of molecular methods for age estimation allowing to use human specimens that possess no morphological age information, such as bloodstains, is extremely valuable as this type of samples is commonly found at crime scenes. Recently, we introduced a DNA-based approach for human age estimation from blood based on the quantification of T-cell specific DNA rearrangements (sjTRECs), which achieves accurate assignment of blood DNA samples to one of four 20-year-interval age categories. Aiming at improving the accuracy of molecular age estimation from blood, we investigated different types of biomarkers. We started out by systematic genome-wide surveys for new age-informative mRNA and DNA methylation markers in blood from the same young and old individuals using microarray technologies. The obtained candidate markers were validated in independent samples covering a wide age range using alternative technologies together with previously proposed DNA methylation, sjTREC, and telomere length markers. Cross-validated multiple regression analysis was applied for estimating and validating the age predictive power of various sets of biomarkers within and across different marker types. We found that DNA methylation markers outperformed mRNA, sjTREC, and telomere length in age predictive power. The best performing model included 8 DNA methylation markers derived from 3 CpG islands reaching a high level of accuracy (cross-validated R(2)=0.88, SE+/-6.97 years, mean absolute deviation 5.07 years). However, our data also suggest that mRNA markers can provide independent age information: a model using a combined set of 5 DNA methylation markers and one mRNA marker could provide similarly high accuracy (cross-validated R(2)=0.86, SE+/-7.62 years, mean absolute deviation 4.60 years). Overall, our study provides new and confirms previously suggested molecular biomarkers for age estimation from blood. Moreover, our comparative study design revealed that DNA methylation markers are superior for this purpose over other types of molecular biomarkers tested. While the new and some previous findings are highly promising, before molecular age estimation can eventually meet forensic practice, the proposed biomarkers should be tested further in larger sets of blood samples from both healthy and unhealthy individuals, and markers and genotyping methods shall be validated to meet forensic standards.",4.604,813

Following previous investigation in the field, we further investigated differences in BDNF promoter gene methylation in patients with mood disorders, comparing unipolar and bipolar subjects, on the basis of illness phase, gender, age and psychotropic prescription. METHODS: 154 patients (43 MDD; 61 BD I; 50 BD II), on stable pharmacological treatment, and 44 age-matched, healthy controls were recruited. BDNF methylation levels from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were compared by analysis of variance followed by Bonferronis post-hoc test. RESULTS: Similar, higher levels of BDNF gene promoter methylation were found in BD II and MDD patients, compared to BD I subjects (P<0.01). When stratified on the basis of mood status, methylation levels of depressed patients were significantly higher, compared to the levels of manic/mixed patients (P<0.01). While gender and age did not seem to influence methylation levels of BDNF gene promoter, patients on lithium and valproate showed overall lower levels. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional analysis using PBMCs with further investigation with larger samples, including drug-naive patients, needed to replicate findings in neuronal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Present data confirm our previous results of higher methylation levels in BD II (compared to BD I) and MDD patients (compared to controls). A closer relationship between BD II and MDD, compared to BD I patients as well an association of lower methylation levels with the presence of mania/mixed state, compared to the depressive phase, was observed.",3.383,1461

We observed consistent increased methylation in gene bodies and hypomethylation at non-genic regions. We did not find a common methylation signature in all three different models and few regions common to any two models. Our data provide evidence that genome-wide alteration of DNA methylation signatures is a general pathomechanism associated with epileptogenesis and epilepsy in experimental animal models, but the broad pathophysiological differences between models (i.e. pilocarpine, amygdala stimulation, and post-TBI) are reflected in distinct etiology-dependent DNA methylation patterns.",5.578,1666

We tested the association between organochlorine exposure and the global DNA methylation level of leukocytes in Japanese women. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the control group of a breast cancer case-control study in Japan. Subjects were 403 Japanese women who provided blood samples. Serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and nine pesticide-related organochlorines were measured by gas chromatography isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. Further, global methylation level of peripheral leukocyte DNA among 399 women was measured by luminometric methylation assay. Linear trends in the association between methylation and quartile levels of organochlorines were evaluated by regression coefficients in a multivariable linear regression model.

We investigated the extent to which AN is associated with a distinct methylation profile compared to that seen in normal-eater women. METHOD: Genome-wide methylation profiles, obtained using DNA from whole blood, were determined in 29 women currently ill with AN (10 with AN-restrictive type, 19 with AN-binge/purge type) and 15 normal-weight, normal-eater control women, using 450 K Illumina bead arrays. RESULTS: Regardless of type, AN patients showed higher and less-variable global methylation patterns than controls. False Discovery Rate corrected comparisons identified 14 probes that were hypermethylated in women with AN relative to levels obtained in normal-eater controls, representing genes thought to be associated with histone acetylation, RNA modification, cholesterol storage and lipid transport, and dopamine and glutamate signaling. Age of onset was significantly associated with differential methylation in gene pathways involved in development of the brain and spinal cord, while chronicity of illness was significantly linked to differential methylation in pathways involved with synaptogenesis, neurocognitive deficits, anxiety, altered social functioning, and bowel, kidney, liver and immune function. DISCUSSION: Although pre-existing differences cannot be ruled out, our findings are consistent with the idea of secondary alterations in methylation at genomic regions pertaining to social-emotional impairments and physical sequelae that are commonly seen in AN patients. Further investigation is needed to establish the clinical relevance of the affected genes in AN, and, importantly, reversibility of effects observed with nutritional rehabilitation and treatment.",0,129

Based on our previous findings on the interaction between Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and BMP-2 in OA, we aimed to investigate the role of DNA methylation and BMP-2 on SOST's expression in OA chondrocytes. METHODS: SOST mRNA and protein expression levels were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The methylation status of SOST promoter was analysed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and bisulfite sequencing analysis. The effect of BMP-2 and 5'-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) on SOST's expression levels were investigated and Smad1/5/8 binding to SOST promoter was assessed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIotaP). RESULTS: We observed that SOST's expression was upregulated in OA chondrocytes compared to normal. Moreover, we found that the CpG region of SOST promoter was hypomethylated in OA chondrocytes and 5-AzadC treatment in normal chondrocytes resulted in decreased SOST methylation, whereas its expression was upregulated. BMP-2 treatment in 5-AzadC-treated normal chondrocytes resulted in SOST upregulation, which was mediated through Smad 1/5/8 binding on the CpG region of SOST promoter. CONCLUSIONS: We report novel findings that DNA methylation regulates SOST's expression in OA, by changing Smad 1/5/8 binding affinity to SOST promoter, providing evidence that changes in DNA methylation pattern could underlie changes in genes' expression observed in OA.",3.753,541
25887114,Cell-composition effects in the analysis of DNA methylation array data: a mathematical perspective.,"['Houseman EA', 'Kelsey KT', 'Wiencke JK', 'Marsit CJ']",BMC bioinformatics,2015,"BACKGROUND: The impact of cell-composition effects in analysis of DNA methylation data is now widely appreciated. With the availability of a reference data set consisting of DNA methylation measurements on isolated cell types, it is possible to impute cell proportions and adjust for them, but there is increasing interest in methods that adjust for cell composition effects when reference sets are incomplete or unavailable. RESULTS: In this article we present a theoretical basis for one such method, showing that the total effect of a phenotype on DNA methylation can be decomposed into orthogonal components, one representing the effect of phenotype on proportions of major cell types, the other representing either subtle effects in composition or global effects at focused loci, and that it is possible to separate these two types of effects in a finite data set. We demonstrate this principle empirically on nine DNA methylation data sets, showing that the first few principal components generally contain a majority of the information on cell-type present in the data, but that later principal components nevertheless contain information about a small number of loci that may represent more focused associations. We also present a new method for determining the number of linear terms to interpret as cell-mixture effects and demonstrate robustness to the choice of this parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our work demonstrates that reference-free algorithms for cell-mixture adjustment can produce biologically valid results, separating cell-mediated epigenetic effects (i.e. apparent effects arising from differences in cell composition) from those that are not cell mediated, and that in general the interpretation of associations evident from DNA methylation should be carefully considered.",2.576,1873

The blind subterranean mole rat Spalax eherenbergi superspecies in Israel consists of four species that speciated peripatrically. Remarkably, the northern Galilee species Spalax galili (2n = 52) underwent adaptive ecological sympatric speciation, caused by the sharply divergent chalk and basalt ecologies. This was demonstrated by mitochondrial and nuclear genomic evidence. Here we show that the expression patterns of the p53 regulatory pathway diversified between the abutting sympatric populations of S. galili in sharply divergent chalk-basalt ecologies. We identified higher methylation on several sites of the p53 promoter in the population living in chalk soil (chalk population). Site mutagenesis showed that methylation on these sites linked to the transcriptional repression of p53 involving Cut-Like Homeobox 1 (Cux1), paired box 4 (Pax 4), Pax 6, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Diverse expression levels of p53 between the incipiently sympatrically speciating chalk-basalt abutting populations of S. galili selectively affected cell-cycle arrest but not apoptosis.

DNA methyltransferases establish and maintain the presence of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and ten-eleven translocation cytosine dioxygenases (TETs) oxidise 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), which can be removed by base excision repair (BER) proteins. Multiple forms of DNA methylation are recognised by methyl-CpG binding proteins (MeCPs), which play vital roles in chromatin-based transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and replication. Accordingly, defects in DNA methylation and its mediators may cause silencing of tumour suppressor genes and misregulation of multiple cell cycles, DNA repair and chromosome stability genes, and hence contribute to genome instability in various human diseases, including cancer. Thus, understanding functional genetic mutations and aberrant expression of these DNA methylation mediators is critical to deciphering the crosstalk between concurrent genetic and epigenetic alterations in specific cancer types and to the development of new therapeutic strategies.",4.509,1727

With locus-specific methylation changes being widely investigated for use as biomarkers in various aspects of clinical disease management, we aimed to evaluate to what extent standard laboratory procedures can approximate the quality of the DNA extracted from FFPE samples prior to methylation analyses. DNA quality in 107 FFPE non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples was evaluated using spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the quality assessment results were correlated with the results of locus specific methylation assessment with methylation sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM). The correlation of template quality with PCR amplification performance and HRM based methylation detection indicated a significant influence of DNA quality on PCR amplification but not on methylation assessment.

Alterations in DNA methylation occur early in breast cancer. We hypothesized that cancer-specific methylation markers could enhance breast cancer risk assessment. We evaluated 380 women without a history of breast cancer. We determined their menopausal status or menstrual cycle phase, risk of developing breast cancer (Gail model), and breast density and obtained random fine-needle aspiration (rFNA) samples for assessment of cytopathology and cumulative methylation index (CMI). Eight methylated gene markers were identified through whole-genome methylation analysis and included novel and previously established breast cancer detection genes. We performed correlative and multivariate linear regression analyses to evaluate DNA methylation of a gene panel as a function of clinical factors associated with breast cancer risk. CMI and individual gene methylation were independent of age, menopausal status or menstrual phase, lifetime Gail risk score, and breast density. CMI and individual gene methylation for the eight genes increased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing cytological atypia. The findings were verified with multivariate analyses correcting for age, log (Gail), log (percent density), rFNA cell number, and body mass index. Our results demonstrate a significant association between cytological atypia and high CMI, which does not vary with menstrual phase or menopause and is independent of Gail risk and mammographic density. Thus, CMI is an excellent candidate breast cancer risk biomarker, warranting larger prospective studies to establish its utility for cancer risk assessment. Cancer Prev Res; 9(8); 673-82.

In this study, we aimed to seek DNA methylation changes in peripheral blood and tissue biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The promoter methylation status of genes involved in inflammation and autoimmunity was profiled using the Human Inflammatory Response and Autoimmunity EpiTect Methyl II Signature PCR Array profiles. Methylation was considered to be hypermethylated if >20% according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The microarrays were validated with Quantitative Real-time PCR. Regarding Crohn disease (CD) no gene appeared hypermethylated compared to healthy controls. In ulcerative colitis (UC) 5 genes (CXCL14, CXCL5, GATA3, IL17C, and IL4R) were hypermethylated compared to healthy controls. Some of the examined genes show different methylation patterns between CD and UC.

OBJECTIVE: Alteration on DNA methylation, as an early event in non-genotoxic carcinogenesis, may play an important role in the mechanism of FB1 toxiciy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dose-related effects of FB1 (1-50 microM for 24 h) on global DNA methylation by using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV-diode array detection (HPLC-UV/DAD) and CpG promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) were performed in rat liver (Clone 9) and rat kidney (NRK-52E) epithelial cells. RESULTS: Cell viability reduction is 39% and 34% by the XTT test and LDH release in the growth medium is 32% and 26% at 200 microM of FB1 treatment in Clone 9 and NRK-52E cells, respectively. No significant dose-related effects of FB1 on global DNA methylation which ranged from 4 to 5% were observed in both cells compared with controls. Promoter regions of c-myc gene were methylated (>33%) at 10 and 50 microM of FB1 treatment in Clone 9 cells while it was unmethylated in NRK-52E cells.

The first mutation (M1) is germinal and confers predisposition to the hereditary type, which is transmitted as an autosomal dominant highly penetrant trait, so 90 % of carriers develop retinoblastoma; however, 10 % of carriers either do not develop the tumor or develop it unilaterally. Most mutations are point mutations. Inactivation of the RB1 gene is usually caused by mutations affecting the coding region. Silencing by methylation of the RB1 promoter has been observed in retinoblastoma tumors as a second mutation (M2) and is classified as somatic epimutation. Germline methylation of the RB1 gene promoter was studied in a particular pedigree of six generations from the paternal side, with incomplete penetrance and bias towards healthy male carriers and those affected with unilateral retinoblastoma. RESULTS: The methylation status of the 27 CpGs dinucleotides that constitute the core of the RB1 gene promoter, analyzed by cloning and genomic sequencing after DNA sodium bisulfite conversion, demonstrated a monoallelic methylation pattern which coincides with a c. [-187T > G; -188T > G] sequence variant that is found in peripheral blood lymphocytes and tumor DNA. Unexpectedly, it was the mother who transmitted this variant to two more generations. Microsatellite markers of D chromosome showed a biparental contribution of both D13 chromosomes to the retinoblastoma phenotype, conferring double heterozygosity in the affected cases. CONCLUSIONS: The monoallelic genetic-epigenetic finding, the sequence variant, and methylation suggest a constitutive epimutation and probably a genetic-epigenetic hereditary predisposition for retinoblastoma in this family.",4.543,168

However, the exact mechanism of ncRNA guidance, particularly piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), for the targeting of epigenetic regulatory factors to specific gene regions is unclear. Although piRNA function was first established in germ-line cells, piRNA may be crucial in cancer cells. This study investigated the potential roles of CDKN2B-related piRNA in leukemia cells to provide a potential tumorigenesis model of leukemia. CDKN2B-related piRNAs, hsa_piR_014637 and hsa_piR_011186 were transduced into the leukemia cell line U937 to study the effect of these two piRNAs on cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, heterochromatin formation, CDKN2B methylation and expression. Our results show that over-expressing hsa_piR_011186 promoted cell-cycle progression and decreased apoptosis. We also observed inhibition of CDKN2B gene expression. These effects were likely mediated by novel piRC (piRNA complex) of CDKN2B-related piRNA that associate with DNMT1, Suv39H1 and/or EZH2 proteins to modulate the methylation of DNA and histone H3 in the promoter region of the CDKN2B gene.

METHODS: The present study examines the association between life-course SES and DNA methylation of candidate genes, selected on the basis of their involvement in SES-related inflammation, in the context of a genome-wide methylation study. Participants were 857 healthy individuals sampled from the EPIC Italy prospective cohort study. RESULTS: Indicators of SES were associated with DNA methylation of genes involved in inflammation. NFATC1, in particular, was consistently found to be less methylated in individuals with low vs high SES, in a dose-dependent manner. IL1A, GPR132 and genes belonging to the MAPK family were also less methylated among individuals with low SES. In addition, associations were found between SES and CXCL2 and PTGS2, but these genes were consistently more methylated among low SES individuals.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is independent from nuclear DNA and uses separate epigenetic machinery to regulate mtDNA methylation. The mtDNA damage induced by oxidative stress can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and is implicated in human diseases; however, mtDNA methylation has been largely overlooked in environmental studies relating to human disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between exposure to fine metal-rich particulates (particulate matter <2.5 microm in diameter [PM2.5]) from welding in a boilermaker union and blood mtDNA methylation in relation to heart rate variability. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-eight healthy men were recruited on multiple sampling cycles at the Boilermaker Union Local 29, located in Quincy, Massachusetts. We measured personal PM2.5 in the background ambient environment. We measured blood mtDNA methylation in the mtDNA promoter (D-loop) and genes essential for ATP synthesis (MT-TF and MT-RNR1) by bisulfite pyrosequencing. All analyses were adjusted for demographics, type of job, season, welding-work day, and mtDNA methylation experimental batch effect. The participants' PM2.5 exposure was significantly higher after a welding-work day (mean 0.38 mg/m(3)) than the background personal level (mean 0.15 mg/m(3), P<0.001). Blood mtDNA methylation in the D-loop promoter was associated with PM2.5 levels (beta=-0.99%, SE=0.41, P=0.02). MT-TF and MT-RNR1 methylation was not associated with PM2.5 exposure (beta=0.10%, SE=0.45, P=0.82).

Meningioma formation might also occur in the setting of an inflammatory microenvironment. However, the association between inflammation and the methylation of NF2 remains unclear. The present study investigates the role and regulatory mechanism of IL-1beta, one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, in the methylation of NF2 in benign meningioma. Three primary low-grade meningioma cells and leptomeningeal cells were cultured. CCK-8 and BrdU assays demonstrated that proliferation of meningioma/leptomeningeal cells treated with IL-1beta occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Methylation-specific PCR verified that IL-1beta induced methylation of the NF2 promoter and decreased NF2/merlin expression in meningioma/leptomeningeal cells. Real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence showed that IL-1beta up-regulated DNMT1 in meningioma cells and DNMT1/3b in leptomeningeal cells but did not up-regulate DNMT3a. After co-treatment with the DNMT inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and DNMT siRNA, methylation of NF2 induced by IL-1beta was attenuated and merlin expression was restored. Furthermore, we showed that DNMT1 in meningiomas and DNMT1/3b in leptomeninges were regulated via activation of the MAPK (p38, ERK, JNK) and NF-kappaB pathways. These results suggest that IL-1beta induces methylation of NF2 by up-regulating DNMT1 in benign meningioma cells and DNMT1/3b in leptomeningeal cells via MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways. Therefore, NF2 methylation is a linker between IL-1beta and tumor development, and DNMTs might be potential therapeutic targets in meningioma for regulating NF2 and inhibiting tumor development.

Clinically, we have determined that more than 70% of lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/leukemia bone marrow extracts display a hypermethylated PLK4 promoter region in comparison to the normal. Decreased PLK4 protein expression due to promoter hypermethylation was negatively correlated with JAK2 overexpression, a common occurrence in hematological malignancies. In vitro examination of the PLKs under biologically relevant condition of 5% O2 revealed that the highly conserved PLKs respond to lower oxygen tension at both the DNA and the protein level.

An alternative approach to increase the response rate of IFN-alpha might be to immunologically stimulate the host with glucocorticoids (GCs) before treatment with IFN-alpha, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that the GCs enhance IFN signaling by inducing S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) when hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication was effectively suppressed by IFN-alpha. Here, we investigated the effect of GCs and IFN-alpha on AdoMet production and methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) expression in vitro. Furthermore, we determined whether post-transcriptional regulation is involved in HBV-repressed MAT1A expression and AdoMet production induced by dexamethasone (Dex). We found that AdoMet homeostasis was disrupted by Dex and that Dex directly regulated MAT1A expression by enhancing the binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the glucocorticoid-response element (GRE) of the MAT1A promoter. HBV reduced AdoMet production by increasing methylation at GRE sites within the MAT1A promoter. The X protein of hepatitis B virus led to hypermethylation in the MAT1A promoter by recruiting DNA methyltransferase 1, and it inhibited GR binding to the GRE in the MAT1A promoter. Dex could increase an antiviral effect by inducing AdoMet production via a positive feedback loop when HBV is effectively suppressed by IFN-alpha, and the mechanism that involves Dex-induced AdoMet could increase STAT1 methylation rather than STAT1 phosphorylation. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which GC-induced AdoMet enhances the antiviral activity of IFN-alpha by restoring STAT1 methylation in HBV-infected cells.",0,997

It extends also to the linked promoter region, where it forms the basis for different levels of individual allele's expression. Differential expression of HLA class II alleles can shape an immune response and influence the risk of developing autoimmune disease. In addition to genetic variability, variation in epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, can be another cause of the uneven expression of individual alleles. We aimed to analyze the DNA methylation of promoter sequences and the levels of expression of individual DQA1 gene alleles, interallelic variation of these two characteristics and the relationship between them. METHODS: The 60 healthy donors included into study were HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 genotyped using PCR-SSP. Genomic DNA was treated by sodium bisulfite and the target segment in the HLA-DQA1 gene promoter was PCR amplified. PCR product was cloned into Escherichia coli and individual clones were sequenced. Transcripts of individual DQA1 alleles in peripheral blood leukocytes were quantified by Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: In this study, we have described detailed DNA methylation profile of promoter area of DQA1 gene alleles. The overall promoter methylation is increased for DQA1*02:01 and DQA1*04:01 alleles, on the other side, DQA1*05:01 allele shows decreased methylation level. Our results suggest that there are only minor interindividual differences in DRA-normalized expression level of specific allele.

In this study we tested whether methylation levels of NR3C1 were associated with HPA-axis regulation, operationalized as cortisol responses. In 361 adolescents (mean age 16.1, SD=0.6), salivary cortisol samples were collected before, during, and after a social stress task, from which response measures (cortisol activation and recovery) were calculated. Higher NR3C1 methylation levels were associated with a flattened cortisol recovery slope, indicating a delayed recovery time. Cortisol response activation was not associated with NR3C1 methylation.

The marked heterogeneity of breast cancer is matched only with the heterogeneity in its associated or causative factors. Breast cancer in Saudi Arabia is apparently an early onset with many of the affected females diagnosed before they reach the age of 50 years. One possible rationale underlying this observation is that consanguinity, which is widely spread in the Saudi community, is causing the accumulation of yet undetermined cancer susceptibility mutations. Another factor could be the accumulation of epigenetic aberrations caused by the shift toward a Western-like lifestyle in the past two decades. In order to shed some light into the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer in the Saudi community, we identified KLOTHO (KL) as a tumor-specific methylated gene using genome-wide methylation analysis of primary breast tumors utilizing the MBD-seq approach. KL methylation was frequent as it was detected in 55.3 % of breast cancer cases from Saudi Arabia (n = 179) using MethyLight assay. Furthermore, KL is downregulated in breast tumors with its expression induced following treatment with 5-azacytidine. The involvement of KL in breast cancer led us to investigate its relationship in the context of breast cancer, with one of the protagonists of its function, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). Overexpression of FGFR4 in breast cancer is frequent in our cohort and this overexpression is associated with poor overall survival. Interestingly, FGFR4 expression is higher in the absence of KL methylation and lower when KL is methylated and presumably silenced, which is suggestive of an intricate relationship between the two factors.

 Society for Neuroscience",2016,"Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a persistent behavioral sensitization that develops after repeated levodopa (l-DOPA) exposure in Parkinson disease patients. LID is a consequence of sustained changes in the transcriptional behavior of striatal neurons following dopaminergic stimulation. In neurons, transcriptional regulation through dynamic DNA methylation has been shown pivotal to many long-term behavioral modifications; however, its role in LID has not yet been explored. Using a rodent model, we show LID development leads to the aberrant expression of DNA demethylating enzymes and locus-specific changes to DNA methylation at the promoter regions of genes aberrantly transcribed following l-DOPA treatment. Looking for dynamic DNA methylation in LID genome-wide, we used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and found an extensive reorganization of the dorsal striatal methylome. LID development led to significant demethylation at many important regulatory areas of aberrantly transcribed genes. We used pharmacologic treatments that alter DNA methylation bidirectionally and found them able to modulate dyskinetic behaviors. Together, these findings demonstrate that l-DOPA induces widespread changes to striatal DNA methylation and that these modifications are required for the development and maintenance of LID. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) develops after repeated levodopa (l-DOPA) exposure in Parkinson disease patients and remains one of the primary obstacles to effective treatment. LID behaviors are a consequence of striatal neuron sensitization due to sustained changes in transcriptional behavior; however, the mechanisms responsible for the long-term maintenance of this cellular priming remain uncertain. Regulation of dynamic DNA methylation has been shown pivotal to the maintenance of several long-term behavioral modifications, yet its role in LID has not yet been explored. In this work, we report a pivotal role for the reorganization of DNA methylation in the development of LID and show that modification of DNA methylation may be a novel therapeutic target for use in preventing or reversing dyskinetic behaviors.",0,604

It is a determinant in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and is overexpressed in human multiple myeloma. Despite the relevance of NSD2 to cancer, there are no potent, selective inhibitors of this enzyme reported. Here, a combination of kinetic isotope effect measurements and quantum chemical modeling was used to provide subangstrom details of the transition state structure for NSD2 enzymatic activity. Kinetic isotope effects were measured for the methylation of isolated HeLa cell nucleosomes by NSD2. NSD2 preferentially catalyzes the dimethylation of H3K36 along with a reduced preference for H3K36 monomethylation. Primary Me-(14)C and (36)S and secondary Me-(3)H3, Me-(2)H3, 5'-(14)C, and 5'-(3)H2 kinetic isotope effects were measured for the methylation of H3K36 using specifically labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The intrinsic kinetic isotope effects were used as boundary constraints for quantum mechanical calculations for the NSD2 transition state. The experimental and calculated kinetic isotope effects are consistent with an SN2 chemical mechanism with methyl transfer as the first irreversible chemical step in the reaction mechanism. The transition state is a late, asymmetric nucleophilic displacement with bond separation from the leaving group at (2.53 A) and bond making to the attacking nucleophile (2.10 A) advanced at the transition state. The transition state structure can be represented in a molecular electrostatic potential map to guide the design of inhibitors that mimic the transition state geometry and charge.",9.674,33

Studies of mouse models of asthma have observed greater levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) expression in lungs. TET proteins are known to catalyze methylation through modification of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hmC. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the association of TET1 methylation with asthma and traffic-related air pollution (TRAP). METHODS: TET1 methylation levels from DNA derived from nasal airway epithelial cells collected from 12 African American children with physician-diagnosed asthma and their nonasthmatic siblings were measured by using Illumina 450K arrays. Regions of interest were verified by means of locus-specific pyrosequencing in 35 sibling pairs and replicated in an independent population (n = 186). Exposure to TRAP in participants' early life and at current home addresses was estimated by using a land-use regression model. Methylation studies in saliva, PBMCs, and human bronchial epithelial cells were done to support our findings. RESULTS: Loss of methylation at a single CpG site in the TET1 promoter (cg23602092) and increased global 5-hmC levels were significantly associated with asthma. In contrast, TRAP exposure at participants' current homes significantly increased methylation at the same site. Patterns were consistent across tissue sample types. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and diesel exhaust particle exposure in human bronchial epithelial cells was associated with altered TET1 methylation and expression and global 5-hmC levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a possible role of TET1 methylation in asthmatic patients and response to TRAP.",0,58

Therefore, we performed an epigenome-wide association study for measures of glucose metabolism in whole blood samples of the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F4 study using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. We identified a total of 31 CpG sites where methylation level was associated with measures of glucose metabolism after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and estimated white blood cell proportions and correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) method (four for fasting glucose, seven for fasting insulin, 25 for homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]; B-H-adjusted p-values between 9.2x10(-5) and 0.047). In addition, DNA methylation at cg06500161 (annotated to ABCG1) was associated with all the aforementioned phenotypes and 2-hour glucose (B-H-adjusted p-values between 9.2x10(-5) and 3.0x10(-3)). Methylation status of additional three CpG sites showed an association with fasting insulin only after additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (B-H-adjusted p-values = 0.047). Overall, effect strengths were reduced by around 30% after additional adjustment for BMI, suggesting that this variable has an influence on the investigated phenotypes. Furthermore, we found significant associations between methylation status of 21 of the aforementioned CpG sites and 2-hour insulin in a subset of samples with seven significant associations persisting after additional adjustment for BMI. In a subset of 533 participants, methylation of the CpG site cg06500161 (ABCG1) was inversely associated with ABCG1 gene expression (B-H-adjusted p-value = 1.5x10(-9)). Additionally, we observed an enrichment of the top 1,000 CpG sites for diabetes-related canonical pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. In conclusion, our study indicates that DNA methylation and diabetes-related traits are associated and that these associations are partially BMI-dependent. Furthermore, the interaction of ABCG1 with glucose metabolism is modulated by epigenetic processes.",3.234,283

DNA methylation levels are linked to obesity and to breast cancer survival. We hypothesized that obesity may work in conjunction with the epigenome to alter prognosis. Using a population-based sample of women diagnosed with first primary breast cancer, we examined modification of the obesity-mortality association by DNA methylation. In-person interviews were conducted approximately 3 months after diagnosis. Weight and height were assessed [to estimate body mass index (BMI)], and blood samples collected. Promoter methylation of 13 breast cancer-related genes was assessed in archived tumor by methylation-specific PCR and Methyl Light. Global methylation in white blood cell DNA was assessed by analysis of long interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1) and with the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA). Vital status among 1308 patients (with any methylation biomarker and complete BMI assessment) was determined after approximately 15 years of follow-up (N = 194/441 deaths due to breast cancer-specific/all-cause mortality). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using two-sided p values of 0.05. Breast cancer-specific mortality was higher among obese (BMI >/= 30) patients with promoter methylation in APC (HR = 2.47; 95 % CI = 1.43-4.27) and TWIST1 (HR = 4.25; 95 % CI = 1.43-12.70) in breast cancer tissue. Estimates were similar, but less pronounced, for all-cause mortality. Increased all-cause (HR = 1.81; 95 % CI = 1.19-2.74) and breast cancer-specific (HR = 2.61; 95 % CI = 1.45-4.69) mortality was observed among obese patients with the lowest LUMA levels. The poor breast cancer prognosis associated with obesity may depend on methylation profiles, which warrants further investigation.",3.94,1119

26024968,Controlling for conservation in genome-wide DNA methylation studies.,"['Singer M', 'Pachter L']",BMC genomics,2015,"BACKGROUND: A commonplace analysis in high-throughput DNA methylation studies is the comparison of methylation extent between different functional regions, computed by averaging methylation states within region types and then comparing averages between regions. For example, it has been reported that methylation is more prevalent in coding regions as compared to their neighboring introns or UTRs, leading to hypotheses about novel forms of epigenetic regulation. RESULTS: We have identified and characterized a bias present in these seemingly straightforward comparisons that results in the false detection of differences in methylation intensities across region types. This bias arises due to differences in conservation rates, rather than methylation rates, and is broadly present in the published literature. When controlling for conservation at coding start sites the differences in DNA methylation rates disappear. Moreover, a re-evaluation of methylation rates at intronexon junctions reveals that the magnitude of previously reported differences is greatly exaggerated. We introduce two correction methods to address this bias, an inferencebased matrix completion algorithm and an averaging approach, tailored to address different underlying biological questions. We evaluate how analysis using these corrections affects the detection of differences in DNA methylation across functional boundaries. CONCLUSIONS: We report here on a bias in DNA methylation comparative studies that originates in conservation rate differences and manifests itself in the false discovery of differences in DNA methylation intensities and their extents. We have characterized this bias and its broad implications, and show how to control for it so as to enable the study of a variety of biological questions.",3.986,612
26927176,Aberrant Promoter Methylation of the Tumour Suppressor RASSF10 and Its Growth Inhibitory Function in Breast Cancer.,"['Richter AM', 'Walesch SK', 'Dammann RH']",Cancers,2016,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with 1.7 million new cases each year. As early diagnosis and prognosis are crucial factors in cancer treatment, we investigated potential DNA methylation biomarkers of the tumour suppressor family Ras-association domain family (RASSF). Promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressors leads to their inactivation and thereby promotes cancer development and progression. In this study we analysed the tumour suppressors RASSF1A and RASSF10. Our study shows that RASSF10 is expressed in normal breast but inactivated by methylation in breast cancer. We observed a significant inactivating promoter methylation of RASSF10 in primary breast tumours. RASSF10 is inactivated in 63% of primary breast cancer samples but only 4% of normal control breast tissue is methylated (p < 0.005). RASSF1A also shows high promoter methylation levels in breast cancer of 56% vs. 8% of normal tissue (p < 0.005). Interestingly more than 80% of breast cancer samples harboured a hypermethylation of RASSF10 and/or RASSF1A promoter. Matching samples exhibited a strong tumour specific promoter methylation of RASSF10 in comparison to the normal control breast tissue. Demethylation treatment of breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D reversed RASSF10 promoter hypermethylation and re-established RASSF10 expression. In addition, we could show the growth inhibitory potential of RASSF10 in breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D upon exogenous expression of RASSF10 by colony formation. We could further show, that RASSF10 induced apoptotic changes in MCF7 and T47D cells, which was verified by a significant increase in the apoptotic sub G1 fraction by 50% using flow cytometry for MCF7 cells. In summary, our study shows the breast tumour specific inactivation of RASSF10 and RASSF1A due to DNA methylation of their CpG island promoters. Furthermore RASSF10 was characterised by the ability to block growth of breast cancer cell lines by apoptosis induction.",2.735,1618

Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation serve a critical role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to analyze the methylation status and protein expression of RASSF1A in endometriosis (EMS). The ectopic and corresponding eutopic endometrium tissues were collected from 45 women with EMS (EMS group) and normal endometrium tissues from 20 women without EMS (control group). The methylation status of RASSF1A was examined by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure RASSF1A protein level in endometrium tissues. In normal endometrium samples, RASSF1A protein expression was significantly higher at the secretory phase than the proliferative phase. RASSF1A protein expression in the ectopic endometrium tissues and eutopic endometrium tissues were significantly reduced than in normal endometrium (P<0.05). The frequency of aberrant methylation of RASSF1A was 55.56% in ectopic endometrium and 33.33% in paired eutopic endometrium, whereas such methylation was not detected in normal endometrium. Moreover, RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation was frequently associated with reduced expression of RASSF1A, and was common in advanced stage in ectopic endometrium of EMS. Epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A through aberrant promoter methylation may be important in the formation and progression of EMS, and assessment of RASSF1A methylation status in eutopic endometrium may be a potentially useful biomarker to enhance the early detection of EMS.",1.554,1034

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and immunofluorescence analysis were used to explore the distribution of phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX). RESULTS: ChlP experiments after IR at 30 and 60 Gy showed by a factor of 1.28 (1.08-1.53, 95% confidence interval) higher gammaH2AX signal at 45 min after IR in histone H3 trimethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3) compared to lysine 9 (H3K9me3) enriched chromatin fragments. Halving the radiation dose from 60-30 Gy led to a reduction of gammaH2AX signal by a factor of 0.49 (0.37-0.64), independent of the chromatin region. Repair incubation for 240 min led to a decrease of the gammaH2AX signal by a factor of 0.55 (0.45-0.67) in both regions. The fraction of H3K9me3 was determined with immunofluorescent microscopy to be 30.5 +/- 3.8% of the whole chromatin. The fraction of gammaH2AX foci within H3K9me3 regions was shown to be 12.9 +/- 0.4% and 13.9 +/- 0.6% at 45 min and 4 h after 0.5 Gy, respectively, and thus by a factor of about 2.2 lower than the fraction expected from an isotropic distribution.

Understanding the mechanism of action of DNA methylation is important for downstream analysis. In the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K array, there are tens of probes associated with each gene. Given methylation intensities of all these probes, it is necessary to compute which of these probes are most representative of the gene centric methylation level. In this study, we developed a feature selection algorithm based on sequential forward selection that utilized different classification methods to compute gene centric DNA methylation using probe level DNA methylation data. We compared our algorithm to other feature selection algorithms such as support vector machines with recursive feature elimination, genetic algorithms and ReliefF. We evaluated all methods based on the predictive power of selected probes on their mRNA expression levels and found that a K-Nearest Neighbors classification using the sequential forward selection algorithm performed better than other algorithms based on all metrics. We also observed that transcriptional activities of certain genes were more sensitive to DNA methylation changes than transcriptional activities of other genes. Our algorithm was able to predict the expression of those genes with high accuracy using only DNA methylation data. Our results also showed that those DNA methylation-sensitive genes were enriched in Gene Ontology terms related to the regulation of various biological processes.",3.234,162

In utero exposure to arsenic can affect fetal, newborn, and infant health, resulting in a range of phenotypic outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study examined variation in placental DNA methylation and its relationship to arsenic exposure in 343 individuals enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. METHODS: Linear regression models using a reference-free correction to account for cellular composition were employed to determine CpG loci affected by arsenic levels. RESULTS: Total arsenic measured in maternal urine during the second trimester was not associated with methylation in the placenta, whereas arsenic levels quantified through maternal toenail collected at birth were associated with methylation at a single CpG locus (p = 4.1 x 10-8). Placenta arsenic levels were associated with 163 differentially methylated loci (false discovery rate < 0.05), with 11 probes within the LYRM2 gene reaching genome-wide significance (p < 10-8). Measurement of LYRM2 mRNA levels indicated that methylation was weakly to moderately correlated with expression (r = 0.15, p < 0.06). In addition, we identified pathways suggesting changes in placental cell subpopulation proportions associated with arsenic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the potential for arsenic, even at levels commonly experienced in a U.S. population, to have effects on the DNA methylation status of specific genes in the placenta and thus supports a potentially novel mechanism for arsenic to affect long-term children's health.

VIGS was associated with a general increase in the accumulation of small RNAs corresponding to the coding region of the viral transgene. After VIGS, the transgene promoter was not methylated and the coding region showed uneven methylation, with the 5' end being mostly unmethylated in the recovered tissue or mainly methylated at CG sites in regenerated silenced plants. The methylation increased towards the 3' end, which showed dense methylation in all three contexts (CG, CHG and CHH). This methylation pattern and the corresponding silenced status were maintained after plant regeneration from recovered silenced tissue and did not spread into the promoter region, but were not inherited in the sexual offspring. Instead, a new pattern of methylation was observed in the progeny plants consisting of disappearance of the CHH methylation, similar CHG methylation at the 3' end, and an overall increase in CG methylation in the 5' end. The latter epigenetic state was inherited over several generations and did not correlate with transgene silencing and hence virus resistance. These results suggest that the widespread CG methylation pattern found in body gene bodies located in euchromatic regions of plant genomes may reflect an older silencing event, and most likely these genes are no longer silenced.",0,1629

METHODS: A multiplexed nested methylation-specific PCR was applied to quantify promoter methylation of the selected markers in five cell lines, 42 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 71 high-risk PCa tumor samples. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the importance of the methylation level in predicting BCR. RESULTS: A PCa-specific methylation marker HAAO in combination with HOXD3 and a hypomethylation marker TDRD1 distinguished PCa samples (>90 % of tumor cells each) from BPH with a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.95. High methylation of PITX2, HOXD3 and RASSF1, as well as low methylation of TDRD1, appeared to be significantly associated with a higher risk for BCR (HR 3.96, 3.44, 2.80 and 2.85, correspondingly) after correcting for established risk factors. When DNA methylation was treated as a continuous variable, a two-gene model PITX2 x 0.020677 + HOXD3 x 0.0043132 proved to be the best predictor of BCR (HR 4.85) compared with the individual markers. This finding was confirmed in an independent set of 52 high-risk PCa tumor samples (HR 11.89).

The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly hyper-methylated, while larger clusters are predominantly hypo-methylated. Intermediate clusters, however, are either hyper- or hypo-methylated but are rarely found in intermediate methylation states. We develop a model for spatially-dependent collaboration between CpGs, where methylated CpGs recruit methylation enzymes that can act on CpGs over an extended local region, while unmethylated CpGs recruit demethylation enzymes that act more strongly on nearby CpGs. This model can reproduce the effects of CpG clustering on methylation and produces stable and heritable alternative methylation states of CpG clusters, thus providing a coherent model for methylation inheritance and methylation patterning.",9.112,1040

RESULTS: Two presumably unrelated consanguineous families presented with an apparently novel form of primordial dwarfism in which severe growth deficiency is accompanied by distinct facial dysmorphism, brain malformation (microcephaly, agenesis of corpus callosum, and simplified gyration), and severe encephalopathy with seizures. Combined autozygome/exome analysis revealed a novel missense mutation in WDR4 as the likely causal variant. WDR4 is the human ortholog of the yeast Trm82, an essential component of the Trm8/Trm82 holoenzyme that effects a highly conserved and specific (m(7)G46) methylation of tRNA. The human mutation and the corresponding yeast mutation result in a significant reduction of m(7)G46 methylation of specific tRNA species, which provides a potential mechanism for primordial dwarfism associated with this lesion, since reduced m(7)G46 modification causes a growth deficiency phenotype in yeast.

In eutherian mammals, biparental DNA methylation marks are erased and reset during gametogenesis, resulting in paternal or maternal imprints, which lead to genomic imprinting. Whether DNA methylation reprogramming exists in insects is not known. Wasps of the genus Nasonia are non-social parasitoids that are emerging as a model for studies of epigenetic processes in insects. In this study, we quantified allele-specific expression and methylation genome-wide in Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti and their reciprocal F1 hybrids. No parent-of-origin effect in allelic expression was found for >8,000 covered genes, suggesting a lack of genomic imprinting in adult Nasonia. As we expected, both significant cis- and trans- effects are responsible for the expression divergence between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. Surprisingly, all 178 differentially methylated genes are also differentially methylated between the two alleles in F1 hybrid offspring, recapitulating the parental methylation status with nearly 100% fidelity, indicating the presence of strong cis-elements driving the target of gene body methylation. In addition, we discovered that total and allele-specific expression are positively correlated with allele-specific methylation in a subset of the differentially methylated genes. The 100% cis-regulation in F1 hybrids suggests the methylation machinery is conserved and DNA methylation is targeted by cis features in Nasonia. The lack of genomic imprinting and parent-of-origin differentially methylated regions in Nasonia, together with the stable inheritance of methylation status between generations, suggests either a cis-regulatory motif for methylation at the DNA level or highly stable inheritance of an epigenetic signal in Nasonia.",9.343,900

Adiponectin (ADN) is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue and has a variety of functions including the inhibition of PCa cell proliferation. Although serum ADN levels have been identified to be related with carcinogenesis in a tissue-specific context, the exact role of endogenous ADN in PCa cells remains largely unknown. METHODS: Two tissue microarrays were constructed and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was utilized to detect ADN's expression in a cohort of 96 Chinese PCa patients with radical prostatectomy as well as 15 cases with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). MTS and transwell assays were applied to validate the effects of ADN on proliferation and invasive capacity of PCa cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the expression at transcript and protein levels. Epigenetic modifications of ADN's promoter after TGF-beta1 treatment in 22RV1 cells was monitored by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) was performed to determine the methylation status of ADN's promoter. RESULTS: IHC showed decreased levels of ADN in 1 of 15 (6.7%) BPH cases, 6 of 27 (22.2%) PCa cases with low Gleason score (<7), 18 of 26 (69.2%) cases with Gleason score 7, but 32 of 43 (74.4%) cases with high Gleason score (>7). Silencing endogenous ADN could promote proliferation and invasion of 22RV1 cells via orchestrating Epithelial-to-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process. TGF-beta1, a potent EMT inducer, could decrease levels of chromatin markers associated with active genes (H3K4me3, H4acetylK16), and increase levels of repressive marker (H3K27me3) at ADN promoter in 22RV1 cells. Additionally, 5-aza and TSA treatment restored ADN expression in LNCaP cells in which the ADN expression was almost absent. MSP analysis revealed that methylation in the promoter might be involved in decreased expression of ADN in PCa tissues. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that endogenous ADN may function as a tumor suppressor gene through inhibiting EMT of PCa cells but is down-regulated in PCa via promoter hypermethylation.",0,1291

It has been reported that genetic inactivation of P16 drives cancer growth and metastasis, however, whether P16 DNA methylation is truly a driver in cancer metastasis remains unknown. RESULTS: A P16-specific DNA methyltransferase (P16-dnmt) expression vector is designed using a P16 promoter-specific engineered zinc finger protein fused with the catalytic domain of dnmt3a. P16-dnmt transfection significantly decreases P16 promoter activity, induces complete methylation of P16 CpG islands, and inactivates P16 transcription in the HEK293T cell line. The P16-Dnmt coding fragment is integrated into an expression controllable vector and used to induce P16-specific DNA methylation in GES-1 and BGC823 cell lines. Transwell assays show enhanced migration and invasion of these cancer cells following P16-specific DNA methylation. Such effects are not observed in the P16 mutant A549 cell line. These results are confirmed using an experimental mouse pneumonic metastasis model. Moreover, enforced overexpression of P16 in these cells reverses the migration phenotype. Increased levels of RB phosphorylation and NFkappaB subunit P65 expression are also seen following P16-specific methylation and might further contribute to cancer metastasis.

Herein, we describe a microdevice based electrochemical assay for the detection of locus-specific DNA methylation at single CpG dinucleotide resolution after bisulfite conversion of a target DNA sequence. This is achieved by using the ligase chain reaction (LCR) to recognize and amplify a C to T base change at a CpG site and measuring the change electrochemically (eLCR). Unlike other electrochemical detection methods for DNA methylation, methylation specific (MS)-eLCR can potentially interrogate any CpG of interest in the genome. MS-eLCR also distinguishes itself from other electrochemical LCR detection schemes by integrating a peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme sequence into the LCR amplification probes design which in turn, serves as a redox moiety when bound with a hemin cofactor. Following hybridization to surface-bound capture probes, the DNAzyme-linked LCR products induce electrocatalytic responses that are proportional to the methylation levels of the gene locus in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The performance of the assay was evaluated by simultaneously detecting C to T changes at a locus associated with cancer metastasis in breast cancer cell lines and serum-derived samples. MS-eLCR required as little as 0.04 pM of starting material and was sensitive to 10-15% methylation change with good reproducibility (RSD=7.9%, n=3). Most importantly, the accuracy of the method in quantifying locus-specific methylation was comparable to both fluorescence-based and Next Generation Sequencing approaches. We thus believe that the proposed assay could potentially be a low cost alternative to current technologies for DNA methylation detection of specific CpG sites.",6.409,1975

Science. B,2015,"Transcription factors, which represent an important class of proteins that play key roles in controlling cellular proliferation and cell cycle modulation, are attractive targets for cancer therapy. Previous researches have shown that the expression level of activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) was frequently increased in glioma and its acetylation level was related to glioma. The purposes of this study were to explore the methylation level of ATF5 in clinical glioma tissues and to explore the effect of ATF5 methylation on the expression of ATF5 in glioma. Methylation of the promoter region of ATF5 was assayed by bisulfite-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing analysis in 35 cases of glioma and 5 normal tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was also performed to detect ATF5 mRNA expression in 35 cases of glioma and 5 normal tissues. Clinical data were collected from the patients and analyzed. The percentages of methylation of the ATF5 gene in the promoter region in healthy control, patients with well-differentiated glioma, and those with poorly differentiated glioma were 87.78%, 73.89%, and 47.70%, respectively. Analysis of the methylation status of the promoter region of the ATF5 gene showed a gradually decreased methylation level in poorly differentiated glioma, well-differentiated glioma, and normal tissues (P<0.05). There was also a significant difference between well-differentiated glioma and poorly differentiated glioma (P<0.05). ATF5 mRNA expression in glioma was significantly higher than that in the normal tissues (P<0.05). This study provides the first evidence that the methylation level of ATF5 decreased, and its mRNA expression was evidently up-regulated in glioma.",1.278,198

Several environmental contaminants have been implicated as modifying factors of the developing epigenome. This underlines the need to investigate this newly recognized toxicological risk and systematically screen for the epigenome modifying potential of compounds. In this study, we examined the applicability of the zebrafish embryo as a screening model for DNA methylation modifications. Embryos were exposed from 0 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) to bisphenol-A (BPA), diethylstilbestrol, 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, nickel, cadmium, tributyltin, arsenite, perfluoroctanoic acid, valproic acid, flusilazole, 5-azacytidine (5AC) in subtoxic concentrations. Both global and site-specific methylation was examined. Global methylation was only affected by 5AC. Genome wide locus-specific analysis was performed for BPA exposed embryos using Digital Restriction Enzyme Analysis of Methylation (DREAM), which showed minimal wide scale effects on the genome, whereas potential informative markers were not confirmed by pyrosequencing. Site-specific methylation was examined in the promoter regions of three selected genes vasa, vtg1 and cyp19a2, of which vasa (ddx4) was the most responsive. This analysis distinguished estrogenic compounds from metals by direction and sensitivity of the effect compared to embryotoxicity. In conclusion, the zebrafish embryo is a potential screening tool to examine DNA methylation modifications after xenobiotic exposure. The next step is to examine the adult phenotype of exposed embryos and to analyze molecular mechanisms that potentially link epigenetic effects and altered phenotypes, to support the DOHaD hypothesis.",3.705,96

However, aberrations in the apelin system impair pulmonary vascular function, potentially resulting in the development of high-altitude (HA)-related disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of apelin, apelin receptor (APLNR), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) in HA adaptation and HA pulmonary edema (HAPE). A genome-wide association study and sequencing identified variants of apelin, APLNR, and NOS3 that were validated in a larger sample size of HAPE-patients (HAPE-p), HAPE-free controls (HAPE-f), and healthy highland natives (HLs). Apelin-13 and nitrite levels and apelin and NOS3 expression were down-regulated in HAPE-p (P < 0.001). Among the several studied polymorphisms, apelin rs3761581, rs2235312, and rs3115757; APLNR rs11544374 and rs2282623; and NOS3 4b/4a, rs1799983, and rs7830 were associated with HAPE (P < 0.03). The risk allele rs3761581G was associated with a 58.6% reduction in gene expression (P = 0.017), and the risk alleles rs3761581G and rs2235312T were associated with low levels of apelin-13 and nitrite (P < 0.05). The latter two levels decreased further when both of these risk alleles were present in the patients (P < 0.05).

In all vertebrates, SPARC is dynamically expressed during embryogenesis. However, the precise function of SPARC and the regulatory elements required for its expression in particular during early embryogenesis are largely unknown. RESULTS: The present study was undertaken to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate sparc gene expression by in vivo functional characterization of the sparc promoter and identification of possible putative regulatory elements that govern basal promoter activity. We report here transient expression analyses of eGFP expression from transgenic zebrafish containing a Sparc-iTol2-eGFP-BAC and/or 7.25 kb-sparc-Tol2-eGFP constructs. eGFP expression was specifically found in the notochord, otic vesicle, fin fold, intermediate cell mass, and olfactory placode of BAC and Tol2 transposon vectors injected embryos. Deletion analysis revealed that promoter activity resides in the unique 5'-untranslated intronic region. Computer-based analysis revealed a putative CpG island immediately proximal to the translation start site within the intron sequence. Global inhibition of methylation with 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine promoted sparc expression in association with decreasing CpG methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data identify a contributory role for DNA methylation in regulating sparc expression in zebrafish embryogenesis.",2.376,1761

The variation of apoptosis associated proteins Caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, tumor suppressor protein p15, and the expression level of histone methylation of H3K4, H3K9 and histone acetylation of H3, DNMT1 were detected by Western Blot. RESULTS: 1 in circle Molt-4 cell proliferation rates were (87.68+/-3.54)%, (67.84+/-3.24)%, (51.48+/-3.37)%, (28.72+/-2.56)% respectively after exposured to phenelzine at 5, 10, 15, 20 mumol/L for 24 h, P<0.05. 2 in circle After 10 mumol/L of phenelzine exposure for 24, 48, 72 h, cell proliferation rates were (67.84+/-3.24)%, (50.24+/-2.01)%, (40.31+/-2.25)%, P<0.05. 3 in circle The apoptotic rates were (13.64+/-2.58)%, (31.24+/-3.42)%, (56.37+/-4.26)% after phenelzine treatment at 5, 10, 20 mumol/L for 24 h, which was concentration dependent. 4 in circle Phenelzine could upregulate the expression of Bax, caspase-3, p21, and downregulate Bcl-2 expression. Phenelzine upregulated the methylation level of histone H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and histone acetylated H3, while it didn't change the level of histone H3K4me3, H3K9me1, H3K9me2.  Phenelzine inhibited DNMT1 expression and promoted p15 expression.

Previous studies have shown that CDH13 methylation correlated with advanced disease and poor prognosis in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The aim of the current study was to investigate the correlations between CDH13 methylation and disease recurrence as well as progression of NMIBC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The methylation status of CDH13 in 178 NMIBC samples and 38 normal bladder epithelial tissues was examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and then correlated with clinicopathological features. RESULTS: We found that CDH13 methylation occurs frequently in NMIBC, and significantly correlates with high grade, advanced stage, larger tumor size, and tumor recurrence and progression. Moreover, patients with methylated CDH13 exhibited significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (P<0.0001) and progression-free survival (P=0.0060) than patients with unmethylated CDH13. In addition, a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis suggests that CDH13 methylation is an independent predictor for the recurrence (P=0.0043) and progression (P=0.0016) of NMIBC after initial transurethral resection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CDH13 methylation is a frequent event in NMIBC, and is associated with unfavorable tumor features. It should be used as an independent predictor for the recurrence and progression of NMIBC, and may be useful for the design of individualized therapeutic modalities.",1.433,1893

We profiled CpG methylation in frontal cortex of 27 fetuses from gestational weeks 12-42, using Illumina 450K methylation arrays. Sites showing genome-wide significant correlation with gestational age were compared to a publicly available data set from gestational weeks 3-26. Altogether, we identified 2016 matching developmentally regulated differentially methylated positions (m-dDMPs): 1767m-dDMPs were hypermethylated and 1149 hypomethylated during fetal development. M-dDMPs are underrepresented in CpG islands and gene promoters, and enriched in gene bodies. They appear to cluster in certain chromosome regions. M-dDMPs are significantly enriched in autism-associated genes and CpGs. Our results promote the idea that reduced methylation dynamics during fetal brain may predispose to autism. In addition, m-dDMPs are enriched in genes with human-specific brain expression patterns and/or histone modifications. Collectively, we defined a subset of dDMPs exhibiting constant methylation changes from early to late pregnancy.

We characterized hydroxymethylation and methylation marks by performing whole-genome next-generation sequencing in representative normal and prostate cancer-derived cell lines in order to determine functional pathways and key genes regulated by these epigenomic modifications in cancer. RESULTS: Our cell line model shows disruption of hydroxymethylation distribution in cancer, with global loss and highly specific gain in promoter and CpG island regions. Significantly, we observed locus-specific retention of hydroxymethylation marks in specific intronic and intergenic regions which may play a novel role in the regulation of gene expression in critical functional pathways, such as BARD1 signaling and steroid hormone receptor signaling in cancer. We confirm a modest correlation of hydroxymethylation with expression in intragenic regions in prostate cancer, while identifying an original role for intergenic hydroxymethylation in differentially expressed regulatory pathways in cancer. We also demonstrate a successful strategy for the identification and validation of key candidate genes from differentially regulated biological pathways in prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a distinct function for aberrant hydroxymethylation within each genomic feature in cancer, suggesting a specific and complex role for the deregulation of hydroxymethylation in tumorigenesis, similar to methylation. Subsequently, our characterization of key cellular pathways exhibiting dynamic enrichment patterns for methylation and hydroxymethylation marks may allow us to identify differentially epigenetically modified target genes implicated in prostate cancer tumorigenesis.",4.543,1829

METHODS: The gene expression profile GSE46750 including 12 normal and 12 inflammatory synovial membrane samples, as well as the DNA methylation profile GSE43269, including 18 normal samples and 23 OA samples, were used. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were screened. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis together with protein-protein interaction (PPI) and microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks of DEGs or DMGs were performed. Integrated analysis of DEGs and DMGs was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 662 DEGs, including 419 up- and 243 down-regulated genes as well as 198 DMGs, including 115 hypomethylated and 83 hypermethylated genes, were screened. GO terms and pathways enriched by up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to immune and inflammatory response. Down-regulated DEGs were entirely enriched in the cell cycle. Genes such as CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) and MAD2L1 (MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1) were highlighted in PPI and the miRNA regulatory network. In addition, 14 overlapping genes between DEG and DMG lists, including CCL3L3 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 3) and IL-8 (interleukin 8) were obtained. Most of them were up-regulated and enriched in the immune and inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: Cell cycle and its related genes, including CDK1 and MAD2L1 (down-regulated), may contribute to the development of OA. Methylation, particularly hypomethylation of genes including IL-8 and CCL3L3 could make positive effects on OA progress. However, further studies are still needed to confirm our results.",1.469,1916

Several methods exist for evaluating DNA methylation, but bisulfite sequencing remains the gold standard by which base-pair resolution of CpG methylation is achieved. The challenge of the method is that the desired outcome (conversion of unmethylated cytosines) positively correlates with the undesired side effects (DNA degradation and inappropriate conversion), thus several commercial kits try to adjust a balance between the two. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of four bisulfite conversion kits [Premium Bisulfite kit (Diagenode), EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen), MethylEdge Bisulfite Conversion System (Promega) and BisulFlash DNA Modification kit (Epigentek)] regarding conversion efficiency, DNA degradation and conversion specificity. METHODS: Performance was tested by combining fully methylated and fully unmethylated lambda-DNA controls in a series of spikes by means of Sanger sequencing (0%, 25%, 50% and 100% methylated spikes) and Next-Generation Sequencing (0%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% methylated spikes). We also studied the methylation status of two of our previously published differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at base resolution by using spikes of chorionic villus sample in whole blood. RESULTS: The kits studied showed different but comparable results regarding DNA degradation, conversion efficiency and conversion specificity. However, the best performance was observed with the MethylEdge Bisulfite Conversion System (Promega) followed by the Premium Bisulfite kit (Diagenode). The DMRs, EP6 and EP10, were confirmed to be hypermethylated in the CVS and hypomethylated in whole blood. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the MethylEdge Bisulfite Conversion System (Promega) was shown to have the best performance among the kits. In addition, the methylation level of two of our DMRs, EP6 and EP10, was confirmed.

Treatment with a methylation inhibitor AdOx reduced CNBP methylation, but did not affect the concentrated nuclear localization of CNBP.

The environment affects DNA methylation, with potentially long-lasting effects on gene expression and disease. This study examined whether DNA methylation could underlie the association between season of birth and allergy. METHODS: In a subset of 18-year-old participants from the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort (n = 367), the risks of birth season on allergic outcomes were estimated. Whole blood epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured, and season-associated CpGs detected using a training-and-testing-based technique. Validation method examined the 8-year-old Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) cohort. The relationships between DNA methylation, season of birth and allergy were examined. CpGs were analysed in IoW third-generation cohort newborns. RESULTS: Autumn birth increased risk of eczema, relative to spring birth. Methylation at 92 CpGs showed association with season of birth in the epigenome-wide association study. In validation, significantly more CpGs had the same directionality than expected by chance, and four were statistically significant. Season-associated methylation was enriched among networks relating to development, the cell cycle and apoptosis. Twenty CpGs were nominally associated with allergic outcomes. Two CpGs were marginally on the causal pathway to allergy. Season-associated methylation was largely absent in newborns, suggesting it arises post-natally. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that DNA methylation in adulthood is associated with season of birth, supporting the hypothesis that DNA methylation could mechanistically underlie the effect of season of birth on allergy, although other mechanisms are also likely to be involved.",6.028,439

Here we show that pre-analytical procedures involved in DNA collection can induce systematic bias in the DNA methylation profiles of blood cells that can be adjusted by cell-type composition variables. In Experiment 1, whole blood from 16 volunteers was collected to examine the effect of a 24 h storage period at 4 degrees C on DNA methylation profiles as measured using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Our statistical analysis showed that the P-value distribution of more than 450,000 CpG sites was similar to the theoretical distribution (in quantile-quantile plot, lambda = 1.03) when comparing two control replicates, which was remarkably deviated from the theoretical distribution (lambda = 1.50) when comparing control and storage conditions. We then considered cell-type composition as a possible cause of the observed bias in DNA methylation profiles and found that the bias associated with the cold storage condition was largely decreased (lambda adjusted = 1.14) by taking into account a cell-type composition variable. As such, we compared four respective sample collection protocols used in large-scale Japanese biobanks or cohorts as well as two control replicates. Systematic biases in DNA methylation profiles were observed between control and three of four protocols without adjustment of cell-type composition (lambda = 1.12-1.45) and no remarkable biases were seen after adjusting for cell-type composition in all four protocols (lambda adjusted = 1.00-1.17). These results revealed important implications for comparing DNA methylation profiles between blood specimens from different sources and may lead to discovery of disease-associated DNA methylation markers and the development of DNA methylation profile-based predictive risk models.",3.234,164

Our aim was to investigate epigenetic mechanisms in ovarian tumorigenesis and, especially, whether tumors with different histological subtypes or hereditary background (Lynch syndrome) exhibit differential susceptibility to epigenetic inactivation of growth regulatory genes. Gene candidates for epigenetic regulation were identified from the literature and by expression profiling of ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines treated with demethylating agents. Thirteen genes were chosen for methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assays on 104 (85 sporadic and 19 Lynch syndrome-associated) ovarian carcinomas. Increased methylation (i.e., hypermethylation) of variable degree was characteristic of ovarian carcinomas relative to the corresponding normal tissues, and hypermethylation was consistently more prominent in non-serous than serous tumors for individual genes and gene sets investigated. Lynch syndrome-associated clear cell carcinomas showed the highest frequencies of hypermethylation. Among endometrioid ovarian carcinomas, lower levels of promoter methylation of RSK4, SPARC, and HOXA9 were significantly associated with higher tumor grade; thus, the methylation patterns showed a shift to the direction of high-grade serous tumors. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a frequent epigenetic inactivation of RSK4, SPARC, PROM1, HOXA10, HOXA9, WT1-AS, SFRP2, SFRP5, OPCML, and MIR34B in the development of non-serous ovarian carcinomas of Lynch and sporadic origin, as compared to serous tumors.

We reported that DNA hypomethylation of EPHX2 induced a pro-inflammatory response in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). However, the change in the whole AA metabolism by DNA methylation is still unknown. Using a metabolomic approach, we investigated the effect of DNA methylation on the balance of AA metabolism and the underlying mechanism. ECs were treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), and AA metabolic profiles were analyzed. Levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), metabolites in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, were significantly increased by 5-AZA treatment in ECs resulting from the induction of PGD2 synthase (PTGDS) and thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1) expression by DNA hypomethylation. This phenomenon was also observed in liver and kidney cell lines, indicating a universal mechanism. Pathophysiologically, homocysteine, known to cause DNA demethylation, induced a similar pattern of the change of AA metabolism. Furthermore, 5-AZA activated ECs, as evidenced by the upregulation of adhesion molecules. Indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, reversed the effects of 5-AZA on the levels of PGD2 and TXB2, EC activation and monocyte adhesion. In vivo, the plasma levels of PGD2 and TXB2 and the expression of In vivo PTGDS and TBXAS1 as well as adhesion molecules were increased in the aorta of the mice injected with 5-AZA. In conclusion, using a metabolomic approach, our study uncovered that DNA demethylation increased AA metabolites PGD2 and TXB2 by upregulating the expression of the corresponding enzymes, which might contribute to the DNA hypomethylation-induced endothelial activation.",4.381,984

It is pertinent to understand the degree to which the offspring methylome is sensitive to the intensity and duration of prenatal smoking. An investigation of the persistence of offspring methylation associated with maternal smoking and the relative roles of the intrauterine and postnatal environment is also warranted. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we investigated associations between prenatal exposure to maternal smoking and offspring DNA methylation at multiple time points in approximately 800 mother-offspring pairs. In cord blood, methylation at 15 CpG sites in seven gene regions (AHRR, MYO1G, GFI1, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, KLF13 and ATP9A) was associated with maternal smoking, and a dose-dependent response was observed in relation to smoking duration and intensity. Longitudinal analysis of blood DNA methylation in serial samples at birth, age 7 and 17 years demonstrated that some CpG sites showed reversibility of methylation (GFI1, KLF13 and ATP9A), whereas others showed persistently perturbed patterns (AHRR, MYO1G, CYP1A1 and CNTNAP2). Of those showing persistence, we explored the effect of postnatal smoke exposure and found that the major contribution to altered methylation was attributed to a critical window of in utero exposure. A comparison of paternal and maternal smoking and offspring methylation showed consistently stronger maternal associations, providing further evidence for causal intrauterine mechanisms. These findings emphasize the sensitivity of the methylome to maternal smoking during early development and the long-term impact of such exposure.",6.393,737

METHODS: Methylation status of hMLH1 gene promoter of 40 patients undergoing radical stomach cancer operation in the Tumor Research Institute of China Medical University between January 2006 and August 2006 was detected by MSP. For each patient, 2 samples were chosen from the cancer site, paracancerous tissues of 1 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm away from the cancer site, separately. One sample was used in pathology examination, and the other in methylation detection. RESULTS: Positive rates of hMLH1 gene promoter methylation in the paracancerous tissues of 1 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm away from the cancer site were 10%(4/40), 12.5%(5/40) and 2.5%(1/40) respectively, which were significantly lower than 32.5%(13/40) in cancer site(all P<0.05). Pathological examination showed precancerous lesions in 23 samples of paracancerous 1 cm and 3 cm tissues and normal tissues in 24 samples of paracancerous 5 cm tissues. Positive rates of hMLH1 gene promoter methylation in the cancer site, paracancerous tissue and normal gastric tissue were 32.5%(13/40), 8.7%(2/23) and 0(0/24) (P<0.01). For cancer tissue penetrated the gastric serosa, 8 out of 14 tissue samples were positive methylation (57.1%), which was significantly higher compared with 5 out of 26 tissue samples without penetration of gastric serosa(19.2%). Positive rate of hMLH1 gene promoter methylation in tissue samples with 7 or more of metastatic lymphatic node number was 61.5%(8/13), which was higher compared to that with less than 7(5/27, 18.5%) (P<0.05). No significant differences of positive rate of hMLH1 gene promoter methylation were found between different tumor gross types, tumor grow pattern, tumor differentiation degree, patient age and sex(all P>0.05).

DNA methylation provides a mechanism for transmitting environmental effects on the genome, but its potential role in LRTIs is not well studied. We investigated the methylation pattern of an enhancer region of the immune effector gene perforin-1 (PRF1), which encodes a cytolytic molecule of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells (NK), in cord blood DNA of children recruited in a German birth cohort in association with LRTIs in the first year of life.Pyrosequencing was used to determine the methylation levels of target cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) in a 2-stage case-control design. Cases were identified as children who developed >/=2 episodes of physician-recorded LRTIs during the first year of life and controls as children who had none. Discovery (n = 87) and replication (n = 90) sets were arranged in trios of 1 case and 2 controls matched for sex and season of birth.Logistic regression analysis revealed higher levels of methylation at a CpG that corresponds to a signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) responsive enhancer in the discovery (odds ratio [OR] per 1% methylation difference 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.50) and replication (OR per 1% methylation difference 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.50) sets. Adjustment for having siblings <5 years old in the discovery and replication sets produced ORs of 1.19 (95% CI 0.98-1.45) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.04-1.50), respectively. Adjustment for gestational age in the replication set had no influence on the results. Methylation levels at adjacent CpGs varied with maternal age, smoking, education, and having siblings <5 years old.Our data support an association between cord blood PRF1 enhancer methylation patterns and subsequent risk of LRTIs in infants. Methylation levels at specific CpGs of the PRF1 enhancer varied according to maternal and family environmental factors suggesting a role for DNA methylation in mediating environmental influences on gene function.",5.723,1217
25469751,miRNA and methylation: a multifaceted liaison.,['Chhabra R'],Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,2015,"miRNAs and DNA methylation are both critical regulators of gene expression. Aberration in miRNA expression or DNA methylation is a causal factor for numerous pathological conditions. DNA methylation can inhibit the transcription of miRNAs, just like coding genes, by methylating the CpG islands in the promoter regions of miRNAs. Conversely, certain miRNAs can directly target DNA methyltransferases and bring about their inhibition, thereby affecting the whole genome methylation pattern. Recently, methylation patterns have also been revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. Whereas m5C is reported to stabilise mRNA, m6A has a destabilising effect on mRNA. However, the effect of mRNA methylation on its interaction with miRNAs is largely unexplored. The review highlights the complex interplay between microRNA and methylation at DNA and mRNA level.",0,834

However, the molecular mechanism is not well understood. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that increased methylation of the Mu opioid receptor (MOR) gene proximal promoter (PP) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a crucial role in the decreased morphine analgesia. Subcutaneous (s.c.), intrathecal (i.t.) and intraplantar (i.pl.), not intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of morphine, the potency of morphine analgesia was significantly reduced in nerve-injured mice compared with control sham-operated mice. After peripheral nerve injury, we observed a decreased expression of MOR protein and mRNA, accompanied by an increased methylation status of MOR gene PP, in DRG. However, peripheral nerve injury could not induce a decreased expression of MOR mRNA in the spinal cord. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), inhibited the increased methylation of MOR gene PP and prevented the decreased expression of MOR in DRG, thereby improved systemic, spinal and periphery morphine analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results demonstrate that increased methylation of the MOR gene PP in DRG is required for the decreased morphine analgesia in neuropathic pain.",3.654,1501

Initially, 26 samples, including 8 each of low [Gleason score (GS) 6] and high (GS >/=7) grade PCa samples and 10 matched normal prostate tissues, were analyzed as a discovery cohort. We identified 3,567 DMRs between normal and cancer tissues, and 913 DMRs distinguishing low from high-grade cancers. Most of these DMRs were located at CGI shores. The top 5 candidate DMRs from the low vs. high Gleason comparison, including OPCML, ELAVL2, EXT1, IRX5, and FLRT2, were validated by pyrosequencing using the discovery cohort. OPCML and FLRT2 were further validated in an independent cohort consisting of 20 low-Gleason and 33 high-Gleason tissues. We then compared patients with biochemical recurrence (n=70) vs. those without (n=86) in a third cohort, and they showed no difference in methylation at these DMR loci. When GS 3+4 cases and GS 4+3 cases were compared, OPCML-DMR methylation showed a trend of lower methylation in the recurrence group (n=30) than in the no-recurrence (n=52) group. We conclude that whole-genome methylation profiling with CHARM revealed distinct patterns of differential DNA methylation between normal prostate and PCa tissues, as well as between different risk groups of PCa as defined by Gleason scores. A panel of selected DMRs may serve as novel surrogate biomarkers for Gleason score in PCa.",4.78,1350

BACKGROUND: The relationship between IGFBP-3 methylation in primary tumors (PTs) or lymph nodes (LNs) and risk of recurrence in patients with stage II CRC treated with surgery alone is unknown. METHODS: IGFBP-3 methylation of DNA from 115 PTs and 1641 LNs in patients with stage II CRC from 2 independent cohorts was analyzed. Forty patients developed recurrence, whereas 75 matched patients remained recurrence free for more than 2 years after surgery. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of recurrence, adjusted for patient and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: Methylation of IGFBP-3 in PTs was identified to be significantly associated with risk of recurrence in the training set. The signature was tested in a validation set and classified 40.7% of patients as high risk. Five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 76.4% and 58.3% for low- and high-risk patients, respectively, with an HR of 2.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.68; P = 0.039). In multivariate analysis, the signature remained the most significant prognostic factor, with an HR of 2.40 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.25; P = 0.029). A combined analysis of 1641 LNs from the 2 sets identified IGFBP-3 methylation in LNs was not associated with risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of IGFBP-3 methylation in PTs, but not in LNs, provides a powerful tool for the identification of patients with stage II CRC at high risk of recurrence.",8.327,218

The epigenetic underpinnings of adiposity are not well understood, and studies of DNA methylation in relation to adiposity have rarely focused on target adipose tissue. Objectives were to evaluate whether genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes are associated with measures of adiposity, including central fat mass, body fat distribution and body mass index. METHODS: Participants were 106 men and women (mean age 47 years) from the New England Family Study. DNA methylation was evaluated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Adiposity phenotypes included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-assessed android fat mass, android:gynoid fat ratio and trunk:limb fat ratio, as well as body mass index. RESULTS: Adipose tissue genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were associated with all four adiposity phenotypes, after adjusting for race, sex and current smoking (omnibus p-values <0.001). After further adjustment for adipose cell-mixture effects, associations with android fat mass, android:gynoid fat ratio, and trunk:limb fat ratio remained. In gene-specific analyses, adiposity phenotypes were associated with adipose tissue DNA methylation in several genes that are biologically relevant to the development of adiposity, such as AOC3, LIPE, SOD3, AQP7 and CETP. Blood DNA methylation profiles were not associated with adiposity, before or after adjustment for blood leukocyte cell mixture effects.

However, these hypotheses have rarely been tested in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) vulnerable to depression. This study aimed to investigate whether brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) methylation status is associated with occurrence and treatment response of depressive disorder in ACS. METHODS: Of 969 patients with recently developed ACS were recruited at baseline, 711 were followed 1 year thereafter. Depressive disorder was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, and classified as baseline prevalent, and follow-up incident or persistent depressive disorder according to status at the two examinations. In addition, of 378 baseline participants with depressive disorder, 255 were randomized to a 24-week double blind trial of escitalopram (N=127) or placebo (N=128), while the remaining 123 received conventional medical treatment for ACS. BDNF methylation percentages were estimated using leukocyte DNA, and a range of demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated as covariates. RESULTS: In logistic regression models, higher BDNF methylation status was independently associated with prevalent depressive disorder at baseline and with its persistence at follow-up. Escitalopram was more effective than placebo for treating depressive disorder in those with a higher methylation, and this effects lead to prevent persistent depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: ACS patients with higher BDNF methylation were susceptible to early depressive disorder, and to its persistence one year later. Adequate antidepressants treatment may effective particularly in those with higher BDNF methylation and then can overcome epigenetic vulnerability for depression persistence in ACS patients.

We have elucidated the antitumor mechanisms of antioncogenic microRNA (miR)-203 which is downregulated in human melanoma, as well as in canine melanoma. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of this downregulation. We focused on epigenetic aberration of miR-203 transcription. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (5-aza) markedly upregulated the expression level of miR-203 in almost all of the cell lines tested. Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing or methylation-specific PCR showed DNA methylation of CpG islands upstream of the miR-203 coding region (MIR203) in both human and canine melanoma cells, as well as in canine clinical specimens, but not in human normal melanocytes. The results of a luciferase activity assay showed obvious suppression of the transcription of miR-203 by DNA methylation. The use of the luciferase activity assay for CREB1 and an inhibition assay of miR-203 function performed with an miR-203 inhibitor confirmed the contribution of miR-203 upregulation toward the negative regulation of the target gene of miR-203. These results indicate that canine melanoma might be a preclinical model of human melanoma for epigenetic studies. In addition, this study suggests that agents that can demethylate MIR203 could be a common promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human and canine melanomas.",2.282,1448

DNA methylation and histone methylation are critical elements in self-renewal of male germline stem cells (mGSCs) and spermatogenesis. mGSCs are the only type of adult stem cells able to achieve intergenerational transfer of genetic information, which is accomplished through differentiated sperm cells. However, numerous epigenetic obstacles including incomplete DNA methylation and histone methylation dynamics make establishment of stable livestock mGSC cell lines difficult. The present study was conducted to detect effects of DNA methylation and histone methylation dynamics in dairy goat mGSCs self-renewal and proliferation, through overexpression of Tet1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An immortalized dairy goat mGSC cell line bearing mouse Tet1 (mTet1) gene was screened and characteristics of the cells were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay, western blotting, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and use of the cell counting kit (CCK8) assay. RESULTS: The screened immortalized dairy goat mGSC cell line bearing mTet1, called mGSC-mTet1 cells was treated with optimal doxycycline (Dox) concentration to maintain Tet1 gene expression. mGSC-mTet1 cells proliferated at a significantly greater rate than wild-type mGSCs, and mGSCs-specific markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclinD1 (CCND1), GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (Gfra1) and endogenic Tet1, Tet2 were upregulated. The cells exhibited not only reduction in level of histone methylation but also changes in nuclear location of that methylation marker. While H3K9me3 was uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus of mGSC-mTet1 cells, it was present in only particular locations in mGSCs. H3K27me3 was distributed surrounding the edges of nuclei of mGSC-mTet1 cells, while it was uniformly distributed throughout nuclei of mGSCs. Our results conclusively demonstrate that modification of mGSCs with mTet1 affected mGSC maintenance and seemed to promote establishment of stable goat mGSC cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that Tet1 had novel and dynamic roles for regulating maintenance of pluripotency and proliferation of mGSCs by forming complexes with PCNA and histone methylation dynamics. This may provide new solutions for mGSCs stability and livestock mGSC cell line establishment.",3.116,1362

The correlation between CD133 expression in tumor tissues with patients survival is still controversial. CD133 expression is determinated by methylation status of the promoter region 1-3. Aberrant methylation of CD133 was observed in glioblastoma. To date, a direct link between CD133 methylation and patient outcome has not been established.To address this question, we studied CD133 expression and promoter methylation in a series of 170 gliomas of various grade and histology, and investigated the correlation of CD133 expression and promoter methylation with patient outcome.We detected five CD133 promoter methylation patterns in 170 glioma samples: methylation only (M+, U-), unmethylation only (M-, U+), both methylation and unmethylation equally (M+, U+), high methylation and low unmethylation (M+, Ul), and low methylation and high unmethylation (Ml, U+). By multivariate survival analysis, we found CD133 promoter methylation status was significant (P < 0.01) prognostic factors for adverse progression-free survival and overall survival independent of tumor grade, extent of resection, or patient age. CD133 immunostaining showed considerable variability among tumors. While, there was lack of correlation between CD133 protein expression and patient's survival. Furthermore, no correlation between CD133 protein expression and CD133 promoter methylation status was observed (Kw = -0.165).CD133 promoter methylation status in glioma is closely correlated with patient survival, which suggest CD133 promoter methylaiton pattern is a promising tool for diagnostic purposes.",3.07,854

The aim of this study was to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation for the identification of methylation markers in obesity. With obese Chinese preschool children, we performed comprehensive DNA methylation profiling of gene promoters and CpG islands to determine the differentially methylated genes using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to the NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 385K Promoter Plus CpG Island Microarray. We found that compared to lean children, 251 promoters and 575 CGIs were demethylated, and 141 promoters and 277 CGIs were hypermethylated in obese children, and their distribution on chromosomes was imbalanced, showing more promoters and CGIs with demethylation on chromosomes 3, 16, 17 and 19 and more differentially methylated promoters and CGIs on chromosome X compared with chromosome Y. Further analysis indicated that aberrant methylations occurred mostly in HCP promoters and promoter CGIs. Among the top 80 promoters and CGIs that had differentiated methylation between obese and lean children, nearly half have been previously studied, and almost all of them are involved in the pathogenesis of cancers that are associated with many organs. Furthermore, four genes (FZD7, PRLHR, EXOSC4, and EIF6) with differential promoter methylation were validated, and their associations with obesity must be clarified. In conclusion, this study represents the first effort to determine methylation markers in obese Chinese children, which has potential relevance for identifying markers that are useful in elucidating the mechanisms of obesity pathogenesis and its complications.",2.138,304

Epigenetic changes to DNA are attractive mechanisms to explain the sustained hyperexcitability of chronic epilepsy. Here, through methylation analysis of all annotated C-phosphate-G islands and promoter regions in the human genome, we report a pilot study of the methylation profiles of temporal lobe epilepsy with or without hippocampal sclerosis. Furthermore, by comparative analysis of expression and promoter methylation, we identify methylation sensitive non-coding RNA in human temporal lobe epilepsy. A total of 146 protein-coding genes exhibited altered DNA methylation in temporal lobe epilepsy hippocampus (n = 9) when compared to control (n = 5), with 81.5% of the promoters of these genes displaying hypermethylation. Unique methylation profiles were evident in temporal lobe epilepsy with or without hippocampal sclerosis, in addition to a common methylation profile regardless of pathology grade. Gene ontology terms associated with development, neuron remodelling and neuron maturation were over-represented in the methylation profile of Watson Grade 1 samples (mild hippocampal sclerosis). In addition to genes associated with neuronal, neurotransmitter/synaptic transmission and cell death functions, differential hypermethylation of genes associated with transcriptional regulation was evident in temporal lobe epilepsy, but overall few genes previously associated with epilepsy were among the differentially methylated. Finally, a panel of 13, methylation-sensitive microRNA were identified in temporal lobe epilepsy including MIR27A, miR-193a-5p (MIR193A) and miR-876-3p (MIR876), and the differential methylation of long non-coding RNA documented for the first time. The present study therefore reports select, genome-wide DNA methylation changes in human temporal lobe epilepsy that may contribute to the molecular architecture of the epileptic brain.",0,586
25662202,The Tet1 and histone methylation expression pattern in dairy goat testis.,"['Zheng L', 'Zhu H', 'Tang F', 'Mu H', 'Li N', 'Wu J', 'Hua J']",Theriogenology,2015,"DNA methylation and histone methylation are critical for mammalian development. Ten-eleven translocation (Tet1), a key regulator of DNA methylation, has been identified as a key enzyme for the activation of DNA demethylation; histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and 27 (H3K27) methylation repress gene expression. Significant progress on the biological functions of Tet proteins has been made in mice and humans. However, their expression pattern and function in the male germ cells in the dairy goat testis are still unclear. The present study described the expression pattern of Tet1, H3K9, and H3K27 in the dairy goat testis and cultured goat spermatogonia stem cells (gSSCs). The results showed that Tet1 was weakly expressed in the dairy goat's testis compared to other organ tissues. Tet1, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, H3K9, and H3K27 expressions were positive and dynamically changing during spermatogenesis; however, they showed weak expression in neonate stage in vivo. Tet1 and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine showed low expression in gSSCs in vitro in differentiated cultures. These will provide new perspectives for DNA methylation/demethylation and better regulation of epigenetic modifications in gSSCs.",1.798,36
26635397,On the role of steric clashes in methylation control of restriction endonuclease activity.,"['Mierzejewska K', 'Bochtler M', 'Czapinska H']",Nucleic acids research,2016,"Restriction-modification systems digest non-methylated invading DNA, while protecting host DNA against the endonuclease activity by methylation. It is widely believed that the methylated DNA would not 'fit' into the binding site of the endonuclease in the productive orientation, and thus steric clashes should account for most of the protection. We test this concept statistically by grafting methyl groups in silico onto non-methylated DNA in co-crystal structures with restriction endonucleases. Clash scores are significantly higher for protective than non-protective methylation (P < 0.05% according to the Wilcoxon rank sum test). Structural data alone are sufficient to distinguish between protective and non-protective DNA methylation with 90% confidence and decision thresholds of 1.1 A and 48 A(3) for the most severe distance-based and cumulative volume-based clash with the protein, respectively (0.1 A was deducted from each interatomic distance to allow for coordinate errors). The most severe clashes are more pronounced for protective methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms (N6-methyladenines and N4-methylcytosines) than for C5-methyl groups on cytosines. Cumulative clashes are comparable for all three types of protective methylation.",9.112,1012

 Society of Preventive Oncology",2015,"BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation plays a key role in cancer etiology. DNA methylation modification, one of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression, is considered a hallmark of cancer. Human and animal models have identified numerous links between DNA methylation and inflammatory biomarkers. Our objective was to prospectively and longitudinally examine associations between methylation of four inflammatory genes and cancer risk. METHODS: We included 795 Normative Aging Study participants with blood drawn one to four times from 1999 to 2012 (median follow-up, 10.6 years). Promoter DNA methylation of IL6, ICAM-1, IFN, and TLR2 in blood leukocytes was measured using pyrosequencing at multiple CpG sites and averaged by gene for data analysis. We used Cox regression models to examine prospective associations of baseline and time-dependent methylation with cancer risk and compared mean methylation differences over time between cancer cases and cancer-free participants. RESULTS: Baseline IFN hypermethylation was associated with all-cancer (HR, 1.49; P = 0.04) and prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.69; P = 0.02). Baseline ICAM-1 and IL6 hypermethylation were associated with prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.43; P = 0.02; HR, 0.70; P = 0.03, respectively). In our time-dependent analyses, IFN hypermethylation was associated with all-cancer (HR, 1.79; P = 0.007) and prostate cancer (HR, 1.57; P = 0.03) incidence; and ICAM-1 and IL6 hypermethylation were associated with prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.39; P = 0.02; HR, 0.69; P = 0.03, respectively). We detected significant ICAM-1 hypermethylation in cancer cases (P = 0.0003) 10 to 13 years prediagnosis. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of IFN and ICAM-1 may play important roles in early carcinogenesis, particularly that of prostate cancer. IMPACT: These methylation changes could inform the development of early detection biomarkers and potential treatments of inflammation-related carcinogenesis.",2.711,295

Present study investigates the contribution of PTEN promoter methylation and its associated protein expression in sporadic breast cancer patients from North India. METHODS: A total of 360 paired breast carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue samples from 180 sporadic breast cancer patients were included in the present study and examined for PTEN promoter methylation status by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry method was used for determining PTEN protein expression. Molecular findings were statistically correlated with various clinicopathological parameters to identify associations of clinical relevance. RESULTS: Presence of PTEN promoter methylation (39.44 %) significantly correlated with its expression downregulation (45.56 %) in breast tumors (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, their interaction with various clinical parameters was evidenced in stratified analysis. Correlation of PTEN promoter methylation with histologically more malignant grade and PTEN expression loss with triple negative tumor status remained significant even after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Results implicate promoter methylation to be a mechanism partially responsible for PTEN silencing in sporadic breast cancer for North Indian women. Besides, methylation and expression loss of PTEN exhibited promising potential as candidate biomarkers of risk assessment in subcategorized breast tumors with critical pathologic parameters.",0,1264

Because Hg can interfere with placental functioning and cross the placenta to target the fetal brain, prenatal Hg exposure can inhibit fetal growth and development directly and indirectly. OBJECTIVES: We examined potential associations between prenatal Hg exposure assessed through infant toenail Hg, placental DNA methylation changes, and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. METHODS: The methylation status of > 485,000 CpG loci was interrogated in 192 placental samples using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray. Hg concentrations were analyzed in toenail clippings from a subset of 41 infants; neurobehavior was assessed using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) in an independent subset of 151 infants. RESULTS: We identified 339 loci with an average methylation difference > 0.125 between any two toenail Hg tertiles. Variation among these loci was subsequently found to be associated with a high-risk neurodevelopmental profile (omnibus p-value = 0.007) characterized by the NNNS. Ten loci had p < 0.01 for the association between methylation and the high-risk NNNS profile. Six of 10 loci reside in the EMID2 gene and were hypomethylated in the 16 high-risk profile infants' placentas. Methylation at these loci was moderately correlated (correlation coefficients range, -0.33 to -0.45) with EMID2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: EMID2 hypomethylation may represent a novel mechanism linking in utero Hg exposure and adverse infant neurobehavioral outcomes.",7.977,1241

METHODS: mRNA expression and promoter methylation of IRAK3 and GLOXD1 in HCC cells were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. Using pyrosequencing results, we further established a quantitative MSP (Q-MSP) system for the evaluation of IRAK3 and GLOXD1 methylation in 29 normal controls and 160 paired HCC tissues and their adjacent nontumor tissues. We also calculated Kaplan-Meier survival curves to determine the applications of gene methylation in the prognosis of HCC. RESULTS: IRAK3 and GLOXD1 expression was partially restored in several HCC cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor; 5DAC). A partial decrease in the methylated band was also observed in the HCC cell lines after 5DAC treatment. Using GLOXD1 as an example, we found a significant correlation between the data obtained from the methylation array and from pyrosequencing. The methylation frequency of IRAK3 and GLOXD1 in HCC tissues was 46.9% and 63.8%, respectively. Methylation of IRAK3 was statistically associated with tumor stage. Moreover, HCC patients with IRAK3 methylation had a trend toward poor 3-year disease-free survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IRAK3 and GLOXD1 were frequently methylated in HCC tissues compared to normal controls and nontumor tissues. IRAK3 methylation was associated with tumor stage and poor prognosis of patients. These data suggest that IRAK3 methylation is a novel prognostic marker in HCC.",2.369,484

All human-associated case-control studies were included providing available data for CCNA1 methylation and reporting the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) conducted with the use of Version 12.0 STATA software. A total of 10 case-control studies (619 patients with cancers and 292 healthy controls) were included for the following statistical analysis. Pooled OR values from all articles revealed that the frequency of CCNA1 methylation in cancer tissues was significantly higher than those of normal tissues (P < 0.001). Further ethnicity indicated that the frequency of CCNA1 methylation was correlated with the development of malignant tumors among all those included experimental subgroups (all P < 0.05). These data from results indicated a significant connection of CCNA1 methylation with poor progression in human malignant tumors among both Caucasian and Asian populations.",1.579,1660

We enrolled 120 patients with NSCLC who had been confirmed by pathologic diagnosis and had been operated on. The methylation states of the EGFR gene promoter were detected and analyzed and a prognosis was given. NSCLC cell lines and nude mice were used to study the treatment reactivity of gefitinib (an EGFR inhibitor) with or without 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) intervention. EGFR expression was high when the methylation degree was lower in patients with adenocarcinoma and poor pathological differentiation of tumor than in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and good pathological differentiation. NSCLC cells with low expression of EGFR and high methylation in the promoter region were insensitive to EGFR-targeted therapy. However, apoptosis and proliferation inhibition of cancer cells were even more pronounced when 5-aza-CdR was used to inhibit methylation. An in vivo study confirmed that methylation adjuvant therapy can improve the sensitivity of cancer to EGFR-targeted therapy. Application of a demethylating agent could be an important supplement for improving EGFR inhibition in the treatment of NSCLC, especially in those who are insensitive to the use of an EGFR inhibitor alone.",0.775,593
26343794,"Methylation-dependent and independent regulatory regions in the Na,K-ATPase alpha4 (Atp1a4) gene may impact its testis-specific expression.","['Kumar DL', 'Kumar PL', 'James PF']",Gene,2016,"The alpha4 Na,K-ATPase is a sperm-specific protein essential for sperm motility and fertility yet little is known about the mechanisms that regulate its expression in germ cells. Here, the potential involvement of DNA methylation in regulating the expression of this sperm-specific protein is explored. A single, intragenic CpG island (Malpha4-CGI) was identified in the gene encoding the mouse alpha4 Na,K-ATPase (Atp1a4), which displayed reduced methylation in mouse sperm (cells that contain alpha4) compared to mouse kidney (tissue that lacks alpha4 expression). Unlike the intragenic CGI, the putative promoter (the -700 to +200 region relative to the transcriptional start site) of Atp1a4 did not show differential methylation between kidney and sperm nevertheless it did drive methylation-dependent reporter gene expression in the male germ cell line GC-1spg. Furthermore, treatment of GC-1spg cells with 5-aza2-deoxycytidine led to upregulation of the alpha4 transcript and decreased methylation of both the Atp1a4 promoter and the Malpha4-CGI. In addition, Atp1a4 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in DNA methyltransferases suggests that both maintenance and de novo methylation are involved in regulating its expression. In an attempt to define the regulatory function of the Malpha4-CGI, possible roles of the Malpha4-CGI in regulating Atp1a4 expression via methylation-dependent transcriptional elongation inhibition in somatic cells and via its ability to repress promoter activity in germ cells were uncovered. In all, our data suggests that both the promoter and the intragenic CGI could combine to provide multiple modes of regulation for optimizing the Atp1a4 expression level in a cell type-specific manner.",2.138,167

Rbl2/p130, a member of retinoblastoma family of proteins, has growth suppressive properties. Numerous studies reported de-regulation of Rbl2/p130 in various types of cancer as a consequence of a number of genetic alterations. However, role of epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation in Rbl2/p130 expression remains elusive. METHODS: In the current study, 76 breast cancer tumors along with normal tissues (n = 76), blood (n = 76) of respective individuals and control blood (n = 50) were analyzed. Rbl2/p130 expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR (syber green method). Promoter methylation status was studied through methylation specific PCR of bisulfite converted genomic DNA. Data was analyzed using various statistical tests. RESULTS: We report significantly reduced Rbl2/p130 expression (P = 0.001) in tumors tissues as compared to control samples. Similarly, Rbl2/p130 expression varies with age and disease stages (P = 0.022), which suggest its involvement in tumor progression. Aberrant promoter methylation (Deltameth) was found in almost all the diseased samples and that was significantly different (P<0.001) with control samples. Similarly, methylation status varies significantly with tumor progression stages (P = 0.022). Hyper-methylation was observed at -1, +3, +15 and +75 of Rbl2/p130 promoter flanking around the TSS. Statistical analysis revealed that Rbl2/p130 expression negatively correlates to its promoter methylation (r = -0.412) in tumor tissues. Our results reflect an epigenetic regulation of Rbl2/p130 expression in breast cancer. This highlights the importance of Rbl2/p130 promoter methylation in breast cancer pathogenesis.",3.234,1152

It is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in cancers and may be used as a potential biomarker. However, the methylation status of protocadherin8 and its clinical significance in prostate cancer remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of protocadherin8 methylation in early-stage prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The promoter methylation status of protocadherin8 in 162 prostate cancer tissues and 47 normal prostate tissues was examined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Subsequently, the relationships between protocadherin8 methylation and clinicopathological features of prostate cancer patients and biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that protocadherin8 methylation occurred frequently in prostate cancer tissues but not in normal prostate tissues. Moreover, protocadherin8 methylation was significantly associated with advanced pathologic stage, higher level of preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), higher Gleason score, positive lymph node metastasis, and biochemical recurrence. In addition, patients with protocadherin8 methylated have shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival time than patients without. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that protocadherin8 methylation was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Promoter methylation of protocadherin8 is a frequent event in prostate cancer, and might be used as an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer.",1.433,1375

Previous studies have shown an association between differential DNA methylation and SLE susceptibility, but have not investigated SLE-related autoantibodies. Our goal was to determine whether DNA methylation is associated with production of clinically relevant SLE-related autoantibodies, with an emphasis on the anti-dsDNA autoantibody. In this study, we characterized the methylation status of 467,314 CpG sites in 326 women with SLE. Using a discovery and replication study design, we identified and replicated significant associations between anti-dsDNA autoantibody production and the methylation status of 16 CpG sites (pdiscovery<1.07E-07 and preplication<0.0029) in 11 genes. Associations were further investigated using multivariable regression to adjust for estimated leukocyte cell proportions and population substructure. The adjusted mean DNA methylation difference between anti-dsDNA positive and negative cases ranged from 1.2% to 19%, and the adjusted odds ratio for anti-dsDNA autoantibody production comparing the lowest and highest methylation tertiles ranged from 6.8 to 18.2. Differential methylation for these CpG sites was also associated with anti-SSA, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP autoantibody production. Overall, associated CpG sites were hypomethylated in autoantibody positive compared to autoantibody negative cases. Differential methylation of CpG sites within the major histocompatibility region was not strongly associated with autoantibody production. Genes with differentially methylated CpG sites represent multiple biologic pathways, and have not been associated with autoantibody production in genetic association studies. In conclusion, hypomethylation of CpG sites within genes from different pathways is associated with anti-dsDNA, anti-SSA, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP production in SLE, and these associations are not explained by genetic variation. Thus, studies of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent a complementary method to genetic association studies to identify biologic pathways that may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of autoimmune diseases.",3.234,1204

CHF has been postulated to result from decreased mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress. Effects of decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption also can accelerate with aging. We previously showed DNA methylation changes in human hearts with CM. This was associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion, being another molecular marker of CM. We examined the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac epigenetic DNA methylation changes in both young and old mice. We used genetically engineered C57Bl/6 mice transgenic for a cardiac-specific mutant of the mitochondrial polymerase-gamma (termed Y955C). Y955C mice undergo left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) at a young age ( approximately  94 days old), and LVH decompensated to CHF at old age ( approximately  255 days old). Results found 95 genes differentially expressed as a result of Y955C expression, while 4,452 genes were differentially expressed as a result of aging hearts. Moreover, cardiac DNA methylation patterns differed between Y955C (4,506 peaks with 68.5% hypomethylation) and aged hearts (73,286 peaks with 80.2% hypomethylated). Correlatively, of the 95 Y955C-dependent differentially expressed genes, 30 genes (31.6%) also displayed differential DNA methylation; in the 4,452 age-dependent differentially expressed genes, 342 genes (7.7%) displayed associated DNA methylation changes. Both Y955C and aging demonstrated significant enrichment of CACGTG-associated E-box motifs in differentially methylated regions.

Epigenetic regulation can play an important role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. However, it is not yet clear whether and how epigenetic modification (i.e., DNA methylation) mediates the adaptation to cold stresses in nature (e.g., in alpine regions). Especially, whether the adaptation to chilling and freezing is involved in differential epigenetic regulations in plants is largely unknown. Chorispora bungeana is an alpine subnival plant that is distributed in the freeze-thaw tundra in Asia, where chilling and freezing frequently fluctuate daily (24 h). To disentangle how C. bungeana copes with these intricate cold stresses through epigenetic modifications, plants of C. bungeana were treated at 4 degrees C (chilling) and -4 degrees C (freezing) over five periods of time (0-24 h). Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers were used to investigate the variation in DNA methylation of C. bungeana in response to chilling and freezing. It was found that the alterations in DNA methylation of C. bungeana largely occurred over the period of chilling and freezing. Moreover, chilling and freezing appeared to gradually induce distinct DNA methylation variations, as the treatment went on (e.g., after 12 h). Forty-three cold-induced polymorphic fragments were randomly selected and further analyzed, and three of the cloned fragments were homologous to genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, UDP-glucosyltransferase and polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein. These candidate genes verified the existence of different expressive patterns between chilling and freezing. Our results showed that C. bungeana responded to cold stresses rapidly through the alterations of DNA methylation, and that chilling and freezing induced different DNA methylation changes. Therefore, we conclude that epigenetic modifications can potentially serve as a rapid and flexible mechanism for C. bungeana to adapt to the intricate cold stresses in the alpine areas.",3.234,1153

Our goal is to determine if there are replicable ancestry-specific methylation patterns that may implicate risk factors for diseases that have differential prevalence between populations. To identify the most robust ancestry-specific CpG sites, we replicate our results in lymphoblastoid cell lines from Yoruba African and CEPH European panels of HapMap. We also evaluate the influence of maternal nutrition--specifically, plasma levels of vitamin D and folate during pregnancy--on methylation in newborns. We define stable ancestry-dependent methylation of genes that include tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators (e.g., APC, BRCA1, MCC). Overall, there is lower global methylation in African ancestral groups. Plasma levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D are also considerably lower among AA mothers and about 60% of AA and 40% of EA mothers have concentrations below 20 ng/ml. Using a weighted correlation analysis, we define a network of CpG sites that is jointly modulated by ancestry and maternal vitamin D.

The objectives of the current investigation were to identify epigenetic biomarkers that might be predictive of response to a weight-loss intervention, and to better understand the influence of certain nutrients (particularly antioxidants) on the epigenome. METHODS: Global DNA (LINE-1) methylation levels were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 96 obese volunteers of the Metabolic Syndrome Reduction in Navarra study, using a methylation-sensitive high resolution melting approach after bisulfite modification. RESULTS: Baseline LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were significantly higher (5.41%) in high responders (>8% of weight loss) as compared to low responders (<8%) to the energy-restricted treatment. Indeed, a LINE-1 methylation higher than 84.15% may be predictive of a high response to the hypocaloric diet. Statistically significant correlations were found between LINE-1 baseline DNA methylation levels and the response to the treatment involving total fat mass and body weight. Furthermore, LINE-1 baseline methylation levels positively correlated with baseline dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC). DISCUSSION: LINE-1 methylation levels in PBMCs might be used to predict response to a dietary weight-loss intervention, and seem to be related to the dietary TAC.

This study was aimed to investigate the Rap2B gene expression and its promoter methylation in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) treated by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). METHODS: 16HBE cells were treated with CSC (1/8 IC50). Soft ager assay, tumorigenicity test, chromosome aberrations analysis were used to identify the transformed cells. The expression level of mRNA and protein of Rap2B was detected using real time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The genome DNA methylation level was detected using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and the methylation status of the target fragment in Rap2B gene promoter was determined by bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). RESULTS: The 16HBE cells were successfully malignant transformed after the chronic exposure to CSC. The expression of Rap2B gradually increased in the process of malignant transformation. Meanwhile, global DNA was hypomethylated. However, no obvious change was observed in the methylation level of Rap2B gene promoter in transformed 16HBE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Rap2B gene may play an important role in the process of lung cancer and global DNA hypomethylation might be an early event in tumorigenesis.",2.26,1723

In honey bees reciprocal crosses can show strong parent-of-origin effects, supporting theoretical predictions that genomic imprinting occurs in this species. Mechanisms behind imprinting in honey bees are unclear but differential DNA methylation in eggs and sperm suggests that DNA methylation could be involved. Nonetheless, because DNA methylation is multifunctional, it is difficult to separate imprinting from other roles of methylation. Here we use a novel approach to investigate parent-of-origin DNA methylation in honey bees. In the subspecies Apis mellifera capensis, reproduction of females occurs either sexually by fertilization of eggs with sperm, or via thelytokous parthenogenesis, producing female embryos derived from two maternal genomes. RESULTS: We compared genome-wide methylation patterns of sexually-produced, diploid embryos laid by a queen, with parthenogenetically-produced diploid embryos laid by her daughters. Thelytokous embryos inheriting two maternal genomes had fewer hypermethylated genes compared to fertilized embryos, supporting the prediction that fertilized embryos have increased methylation due to inheritance of a paternal genome. However, bisulfite PCR and sequencing of a differentially methylated gene, Stan (GB18207) showed strong allele-specific methylation that was maintained in both fertilized and thelytokous embryos. For this gene, methylation was associated with haplotype, not parent of origin. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study are consistent with predictions from the kin theory of genomic imprinting. However, our demonstration of allele-specific methylation based on sequence shows that genome-wide differential methylation studies can potentially confound imprinting and allele-specific methylation. It further suggests that methylation patterns are heritable or that specific sequence motifs are targets for methylation in some genes.",3.986,990

However, the underlying changes in DNA methylation that occur during this turning point of the muscle aging process have not been clarified. To explore age-related genomic methylation changes in skeletal muscle, we employed young (0.5 years old) and middle-aged (7 years old) pigs as models to survey genome-wide DNA methylation in the longissimus dorsi muscle using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing approach. RESULTS: We observed a tendency toward a global loss of DNA methylation in the gene-body region of the skeletal muscle of the middle-aged pigs compared with the young group. We determined the genome-wide gene expression pattern in the longissimus dorsi muscle using microarray analysis and performed a correlation analysis using DMR (differentially methylated region)-mRNA pairs, and we found a significant negative correlation between the changes in methylation levels within gene bodies and gene expression. Furthermore, we identified numerous genes that show age-related methylation changes that are potentially involved in the aging process. The methylation status of these genes was confirmed using bisulfite sequencing PCR. The genes that exhibited a hypomethylated gene body in middle-aged pigs were over-represented in various proteolysis and protein catabolic processes, suggesting an important role for these genes in age-related muscle atrophy. In addition, genes associated with tumorigenesis exhibited aged-related differences in methylation and expression levels, suggesting an increased risk of disease associated with increased age. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in aging pig skeletal muscle. Our findings will serve as a valuable resource in aging studies, promoting the pig as a model organism for human aging research and accelerating the development of comparative animal models in aging research.",3.986,1993

Our km values were similar to other freshwater wetlands and did not differ in ponds categorized with high compared to low surface water concentrations of sulphate. Sites with high sulphate had higher proportions of methylmercury (MeHg) in sediment (2.9 +/- 1.6% vs. 1.0 +/- 0.3%) and higher surface water MeHg concentrations (1.96 +/- 1.90 ng L(-1)vs. 0.56 +/- 0.55 ng L(-1)). Sediment-porewater partitioning coefficients were small, and likely due to high ionic activity. Our work suggests while km measurements are useful for understanding mercury cycling processes, they are less important than surface water MeHg concentrations for assessing MeHg risks to biota. Significant differences in MeHg concentrations between sites with high and low sulphate concentrations may also inform management decisions concerning wetland remediation and creation.",3.359,1518

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) represent one of the largest classes of arginine methylated proteins in both mammals and the early diverging parasitic protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei. Here, we report the effects of arginine methylation on the functions of the essential and previously uncharacterized T. brucei RBP, DRBD18. RNAseq analysis shows that DRBD18 depletion causes extensive rearrangement of the T. brucei transcriptome, with increases and decreases in hundreds of mRNAs. DRBD18 contains three methylated arginines, and we used complementation of DRBD18 knockdown cells with methylmimic or hypomethylated DRBD18 to assess the functions of these methylmarks. Methylmimic and hypomethylated DRBD18 associate with different ribonucleoprotein complexes. These altered macromolecular interactions translate into differential impacts on the T. brucei transcriptome. Methylmimic DRBD18 preferentially stabilizes target RNAs, while hypomethylated DRBD18 is more efficient at destabilizing RNA. The protein arginine methyltransferase, TbPRMT1, interacts with DRBD18 and knockdown of TbPRMT1 recapitulates the effects of hypomethylated DRBD18 on mRNA levels. Together, these data support a model in which arginine methylation acts as a switch that regulates T. brucei gene expression.",9.112,627

Using RNA sequencing, 47 and 113 candidate genes were determined to be related to feed conditions and breed, respectively, and 7 differentially expressed genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, including UCP3. The mRNA levels of UCP3 were significantly different between the 2 feed conditions. The DNA region from bp +1700 to +2459 of the UCP3 gene was studied using the bisulfite sequencing method and contained 46 methylation sites and 3 CpG islands. The results showed that the methylation level of this UCP3 region was lower in DNH chickens (0.77% to 0.88%, P = 0.012) and QJM chickens (0.88% to 0.91%, P = 0.20) under scatter-feed conditions than under captivity-feed conditions. The mean methylation level of UCP3 in DNH chickens was lower than that in QJM chickens under scatter-feed conditions (DNH to QJM, 0.77% to 0.88%, P = 0.007), which suggests that breed affects the mean methylation level of UCP3 under scatter-feed conditions. In summary, our findings suggest that feed condition and breed affect the methylation of UCP3 in chicken breast muscle.",2.108,1099

The deregulation of DNA methylation is a contributing factor to carcinogenesis, as alterations in genetic methylation may contribute to stem cell reprogramming and dedifferentiation processes that lead to a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Here, we investigate the potential effects of FA exposure on DNA methylation and colonosphere formation in cultured human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. We show for the first time that HCT116, LS174T, and SW480 cells grown without adequate FA demonstrate significantly impaired colonosphere forming ability with limited changes in CD133, CD166, and EpCAM surface expression. These differences were accompanied by concomitant changes to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzyme expression and DNA methylation levels, which varied depending on cell line. Taken together, these results demonstrate an interaction between FA metabolism and CSC phenotype in vitro and help elucidate a connection between supplemental FA intake and CRC development.",0,379

METHODS: A DNA methylation assay using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology was performed on 96 Uygur and 96 Han Chinese individuals from Xinjiang province, China. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher BDNF methylation level in Han MCI cases than in Uygur MCI cases in males from Xinjiang province (p=0.022). In addition, the methylation level was significantly higher in Xinjiang Han healthy Chinese individuals (Northwestern China) than in Ningbo Han healthy Chinese individuals (Southeastern China) (Female and Male: p=1.17E-05; Female: p=0.020; Male: p=1.37E-04). But our results showed no significant association of BDNF methylation with MCI in either the Uygur or Han Chinese populations (p>0.05). Further gender-based subgroup analyses did not find any significant results (p>0.05).

OBJECTIVE: We tried to gain further insight into the mechanism for differential SF-1 expression in endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells. DESIGN: We had previously identified a novel CpG island in SF-1, which is located in the downstream intron 1 region. Here, we evaluated the methylation status of this CpG island. PATIENTS: We obtained the eutopic endometrium from disease-free participants (n = 8) and the walls of cystic endometriosis lesions of the ovaries from another group of participants (n = 8). None of the patients had received any preoperative hormonal therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Stromal cells were isolated from these 2 types of tissues and subjected to DNA bisulfite treatment and sequence analysis. RESULTS: The SF-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in endometriotic stromal cells were significantly higher than those in endometrial stromal cells. Bisulfite sequencing showed strikingly increased methylation of a 1-kbp region around the previously identified CpG island in endometriotic cells compared with endometrial cells (P < .001). A strong correlation between SF-1 mRNA levels and percentage methylation of the intron 1 region of the SF-1 gene was observed in endometriotic cells (Spearman correlation coefficient, .96; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of the intron 1 region of the SF-1 gene is associated with its expression in endometriotic cells. This CpG island therefore plays an important role in regulating SF-1 expression.",1.524,1443

A series of epigenetic reprogramming events, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, occur during early embryonic development. However, epigenetic marks in late embryos and neonates are not well understood, especially in avian species. To investigate the epigenetic patterns of developing embryos and posthatched chicks, embryos at embryonic day 5 (E5), E8, E11, E14, E17, and E20 and newly hatched chicks on day of life 1 (D1), D7, D14, D21 were collected. The levels of global DNA methylation and histone H3 at lysine 9 residue (H3K9) modifications were measured in samples of liver, jejunum, and breast skeletal muscles by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. According to our data, decreased levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression were found in the liver and a V-shaped pattern of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression was found in the jejunum. The level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in muscle was relatively stable. Caspase 3 expression gradually decreased over time in liver, was stable in the jejunum, and increased in muscle. Levels of DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation decreased in liver over time, while the pattern was N-shaped in jejunal tissue and W-shaped in pectoral muscles, and these changes were accompanied by dynamic changes of DNA methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases 1, and histone deacetylase 2. Moreover, dimethylation, trimethylation, and acetylation of H3K9 were expressed in a time- and tissue-dependent manner. After birth, epigenetic marks were relatively stable and found at lower levels. These results indicate that spatiotemporal specific epigenetic alterations could be critical for the late development of chick embryos and neonates.",1.672,123

We generated and analysed the DNA methylome profiles of five different tissues and a cell line originated from pig. On average, 39.85 and 62.1% of cytosine and guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) of CpG islands and 2 kb upstream of transcription start sites were covered, respectively. We detected a low rate (an average of 1.67%) of non-CpG methylation in the six samples except for the neocortex (2.3%). The observed global CpG methylation patterns of pigs indicated high similarity to other mammals including humans. The percentage of CpG methylation associated with gene features was similar among the tissues but not for a 3D4/2 cell line.

ANCOVA, adjusting for age, race and BMI, was used to identify differentially-methylated (DM) CpGs. Gene expression, by the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0, was correlated with DM. Biological networks of DM genes were assigned using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Fifty-seven CpG sites were DM in association with eight SNPs in FTHFD, MTHFD1, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, and TYMS (P <5.0 x 10-5); 56% of the DM CpGs were associated with FTHFD SNPs, including DM within FTHFD. Gene expression was negatively correlated with FTHFD methylation (r=-0.25, P=0.017). Four DM CpGs identified by SNPs in MTRR, MTHFR, and FTHFD were significantly associated with alcohol consumption and/or breast folate. The top biological network of DM CpGs was associated with Energy Production, Molecular Transportation, and Nucleic Acid Metabolism. This is the first comprehensive study of the association between SNPs in one-carbon metabolism genes and genome-wide DNA methylation in normal breast tissues. These SNPs, especially FTHFD, as well as alcohol intake and folate exposure, appear to affect DM in breast tissues of healthy women.

A recent study used genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to survey differences in DNA methylation between these two cell types, in both humans and mice. That study minimized the importance of cell type-specific differences in CpG methylation, claiming these are restricted to localized genomic regions, and instead emphasized that widespread and highly conserved differences in non-CpG methylation distinguish neurons and glia. We reanalyzed the data from that study and came to markedly different conclusions. In particular, we found widespread cell type-specific differences in CpG methylation, with a genome-wide tendency for neuronal CpG-hypermethylation punctuated by regions of glia-specific hypermethylation. Alarmingly, our analysis indicated that the majority of genes identified by the primary study as exhibiting cell type-specific CpG methylation differences were misclassified. To verify the accuracy of our analysis, we isolated neuronal and glial DNA from mouse cortex and performed quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing at nine loci. The pyrosequencing results corroborated our analysis, without exception. Most interestingly, we found that gene-associated neuron vs. glia CpG methylation differences are highly conserved across human and mouse, and are very likely to be functional. In addition to underscoring the importance of independent verification to confirm the conclusions of genome-wide epigenetic analyses, our data indicate that CpG methylation plays a major role in neuroepigenetics, and that the mouse is likely an excellent model in which to study the role of DNA methylation in human neurodevelopment and disease.",6.393,1782

Genomic DNA was isolated from 61 oligodendroglial tumors for analysis of methylation using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). We correlated methylation status with clinicopathological findings and outcome. The genes found to be most frequently methylated in oligodendroglial tumors were RASSF1A (80.3%), CASP8 (70.5%), and CDKN2A (52.5%). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis demonstrated longer duration of progression-free survival in patients with 19q loss, aged less than 38 years, and with a proliferative index of less than 5%. Methylation of the ESR1 promoter is significantly associated with shorter duration of overall survival and progression-free survival, and that methylation of IGSF4 and RASSF1A is significantly associated with shorter duration of progression-free survival. However, none of the methylation status of ESR1, IGSF4, and RASSF1A was of prognostic value for survival in a multivariate Cox model.

Duplication and triplication, that is, increased expression of the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene, cause familial PD, and demethylation of SNCA intron 1 has been shown to result in increased expression of SNCA. We thus hypothesized that age-related alterations of SNCA methylation might underly the increased susceptibility toward PD in later life. The present study sought to determine (1) whether alterations of SNCA intron 1 methylation occurred during aging, (2) whether the methylation pattern differed between men and women, and (3) whether purified neurons compared with non-neuronal cells exhibited different methylation patterns. The analysis of DNA from brain tissue and fluorescence activated cell sorting-sorted purified neurons of 41 individuals revealed only a minor increase of SNCA intron 1 DNA methylation levels in presumably healthy individuals during aging but no significant difference between men and women. Interestingly enough, methylation of SNCA intron 1 was higher in neurons compared with non-neuronal cells, although non-neuronal cells express lower levels of SNCA. Therefore, the normal pattern of SNCA methylation during aging should not result in increased expression of alpha-synuclein protein. It is thus likely that additional, yet not identified, mechanisms contribute to the tissue specificity of SNCA expression and the presumed dysregulation in PD.",5.013,108

The Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival, significantly favored patients with a non-methylated APC promoter status (p = 0.008). No other significant correlations between APC and RASSF1A methylation status and different tumor variables examined was observed. Serum RASSF1A and APC promoter hypermethylation is a frequent epigenetic event in patients with early operable gastric cancer. The observed correlations between APC promoter methylation status and survival as well as between a hypermethylated RASSF1A promoter and nodal positivity may be indicative of a prognostic role for those genes in early operable gastric cancer. Additional studies, in a larger cohort of patients are required to further explore whether these findings could serve as potential molecular biomarkers of survival and/or response to specific treatments.",3.68,237

In this retrospective case-control study, we examined the association between small-for-gestational-age (SGA) children and both DNA methylation and gene expression levels of the genes WNT2, IGF2/H19, SERPINA3, HERVWE1, and PPARG in first-trimester placental tissue. We also examined the repetitive element LINE-1. These candidate genes have been reported in the literature to be associated with SGA. We used first-trimester placental tissue from chorionic villus biopsies. A total of 35 SGA children (with a birth weight below the 10th percentile) were matched to 70 controls based on their gestational age. DNA methylation levels were analyzed by pyrosequencing and mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time PCR. None of the average DNA methylation levels, measured for each gene, showed a significant difference between SGA placental tissue compared to control tissue. However, hypermethylation of WNT2 was detected on two CpG positions in SGA. This was not associated with changes in gene expression. Apart from two CpG positions of the WNT2 gene, in early placenta samples, no evident changes in DNA methylation or expression were found. This indicates that the already reported changes in term placenta are not present in the early placenta, and therefore must arise after the first trimester.",3.318,1570

Characterizing the epigenetic effects of drugs is an important step to optimal treatment. We performed comprehensive and gene-specific DNA methylation analyses of quetiapine using human neuroblastoma cells. Human neuroblastoma cells were cultured with quetiapine for 8 days, and DNA methylation analysis was performed using Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. A total of 1173 genes showed altered DNA methylation. Altered DNA methylation predominantly occurred as hypomethylation within the CpG island compared to DNA isolated from non-treated cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes were related to the cellular process of intracellular protein binding. There was no common effect of quetiapine with three mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine). However, common DNA methylation changes in eight genes, including ADRA1A, which encodes adrenoceptor alpha 1A, were found with quetiapine and lithium treatments. Finally, bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that quetiapine decreased the DNA methylation level of the promoter region of SLC6A4, where hypermethylation with bipolar disorder and hypomethylation with mood stabilizers have been reported.",3.689,796

Within the seven NF-kappaB family proteins, the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB is the most studied for its regulation by lysine acetylation and methylation. Acetylation or methylation at different lysine residues modulates distinct functions of NF-kappaB, including DNA-binding and transcription activity, protein stability, and its interaction with NF-kappaB modulators. Here, we describe the experimental methods to monitor the in vitro and in vivo acetylated or methylated forms of NF-kappaB. These methods include radiolabeling the acetyl or methyl groups and immunoblotting with pan- or site-specific acetyl- or methyl-lysine antibodies. Radiolabeling is useful in the initial validation of the modifications. Immunoblotting with antibodies provides a rapid and powerful approach to detect and analyze the functions of these modifications in vitro and in vivo.",0,1384
26715626,Evolutionary Transition of Promoter and Gene Body DNA Methylation across Invertebrate-Vertebrate Boundary.,"['Keller TE', 'Han P', 'Yi SV']",Molecular biology and evolution,2016,"Genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates exhibit highly divergent patterns of DNA methylation. Invertebrate genomes tend to be sparsely methylated, and DNA methylation is mostly targeted to a subset of transcription units (gene bodies). In a drastic contrast, vertebrate genomes are generally globally and heavily methylated, punctuated by the limited local hypo-methylation of putative regulatory regions such as promoters. These genomic differences also translate into functional differences in DNA methylation and gene regulation. Although promoter DNA methylation is an important regulatory component of vertebrate gene expression, its role in invertebrate gene regulation has been little explored. Instead, gene body DNA methylation is associated with expression of invertebrate genes. However, the evolutionary steps leading to the differentiation of invertebrate and vertebrate genomic DNA methylation remain unresolved. Here we analyzed experimentally determined DNA methylation maps of several species across the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary, to elucidate how vertebrate gene methylation has evolved. We show that, in contrast to the prevailing idea, a substantial number of promoters in an invertebrate basal chordate Ciona intestinalis are methylated. Moreover, gene expression data indicate significant, epigenomic context-dependent associations between promoter methylation and expression in C. intestinalis. However, there is no evidence that promoter methylation in invertebrate chordate has been evolutionarily maintained across the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary. Rather, body-methylated invertebrate genes preferentially obtain hypo-methylated promoters among vertebrates. Conversely, promoter methylation is preferentially found in lineage- and tissue-specific vertebrate genes. These results provide important insights into the evolutionary origin of epigenetic regulation of vertebrate gene expression.",9.105,876

However, heterogeneity in these associations may exist across the distribution of methylation outcomes. This study examined whether the association between three-week averaged of temperature and methylation differs across quantiles of the methylation distributions in nine candidate genes. We measured gene-specific blood methylation repeatedly in 777 elderly men participating in the Normative Aging Study (1999-2010). We fit quantile regressions for longitudinal data to investigate whether the associations of temperature on methylation (expressed as %5mC) varied across the distribution of the methylation outcomes. We observed heterogeneity in the associations of temperature across percentiles of methylation in F3, TLR-2, CRAT, iNOS, and ICAM-1 genes. For instance, an increase in three-week temperature exposure was associated with a longer left-tail of the F3 methylation distribution. A 5 degrees C increase in temperature was associated with a 0.15%5mC (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.27,-0.04) decrease on the 20th quantile of F3 methylation, but was not significantly related to the 80th quantile of this distribution (Estimate:0.06%5mC, 95%CI: -0.22, 0.35).

Results from AFLP genetic data revealed that 71.8% of the fragments studied are under Mendelian genetic control, whereas faithful Mendelian inheritance for the MSAP fragments was low (4.29%). Further, MSAP fragment analysis showed that total methylation presented a mean of 28.2%, which was higher than the midparent value, while maternal inheritance was higher (5.65%) than paternal (3.01%). Interestingly de novo methylation in the progeny was high (19.65%) compared to parental methylation. Genetic and epigenetic distances for parents and offspring were not correlated (R(2)=0.0005).

Mutations in PAX3 are associated with Waardenburg syndrome (WS), but the mechanism of how mutant PAX3 proteins cause WS remains unclear. Here, we found that PAX3 loads on mitotic chromosomes using its homeodomain. PAX3 WS mutants with mutations in homeodomain lose the ability to bind mitotic chromosomes. Moreover, loading of PAX3 on mitotic chromosomes requires arginine methylation, which is regulated by methyltransferase PRMT5 and demethylase JMJD6. Mutant PAX3 proteins that lose mitotic chromosome localization block cell proliferation and normal development of zebrafish. These results reveal the molecular mechanism of PAX3s loading on mitotic chromosomes and the importance of this localization pattern in normal development. Our findings suggest that PAX3 WS mutants interfere with the normal functions of PAX3 in a dominant negative manner, which is important to the understanding of the pathogenesis of Waardenburg syndrome.",0,656

METHOD: Taqman real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect the relative expression of miR-34b in control group (bone marrow cells of 20 children without blood disease) and 8 leukemia cell lines (U937, HL-60, MV4-11, M2R, K562, Raji, CCRF, DAMI). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was carried out to detect the methylation differences of miR-34b in control group (Bone marrow cells of 23 children without blood disease), 8 leukemia cell lines. HL-60 and K562 were treated with methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2-dC) for further detection of its methylation status and expression of miR-34b. Hsa-miR-34b mimics was transfected into K562 cell by liposome, the transfection efficiency was detected by flow cytometry. The cell proliferation of hsa-miR-34b transfected group in each stage was measured with CCK-8 assay, and then compared with non-transfected group and negative control group. RESULT: The relative expression level of miR-34b in the group of children without blood disease and the group of leukemia cell lines were 5.22 +/- 1.15, 0.03 +/- 0.03. The results showed that, the group of leukemia cell lines was significantly different from the control group (t = 4.538, P < 0.01) . Eight leukemia cell lines showed methylation, the positive rate of the methyl was 100%. There was no methylation in the 23 cases of control group. After leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K562 were treated with 5-aza-2-dC, the methylated bands became obviously weakened, and the relative expression levels of miR-34b substantially increased 49.5 times and 18.8 times respectively. After hsa-miR-34b mimics was transfected into K562 cell by liposome, its transfection efficiency detected by flow cytometry was 61% and the cell proliferation was measured with CCK-8 assay from which it was found that the cell proliferation was significantly suppressed compared with the control group at 48 h (t = 9.303, P < 0.01), 72 h (t = 65.617, P < 0.01), 96 h (t = 36.878, P < 0.01) and 120 h (t = 18.748, P < 0.01) in hsa-miR-34b transfected group, with the inhibition rate of 12.2% (48 h), 45.7% (72 h), 32.5% (96 h) and 22.9% (120 h).

DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression, and mapping of methylation patterns has become an important tool for understanding pathologic gene expression events. The goal of this study was to investigate aberrant changes in promoter DNA methylation in zebrafish embryos and larvae following a parental and continued embryonic waterborne BaP exposure. A total of 21 genes known for their role in human diseases were selected to measure percent methylation by multiplex deep sequencing. At 96hpf (hours post fertilization) compared to 3.3hpf, dazl, nqo1, sox3, cyp1b1, and gstp1 had higher methylation percentages while c-fos and cdkn1a had decreased CG methylation. BaP exposure significantly reduced egg production and offspring survival. Moreover, BaP decreased global methylation and altered CG, CHH, and CHG methylation both at 3.3 and 96hpf. CG methylation changed by 10% or more due to BaP in six genes (c-fos, cdkn1a, dazl, nqo1, nrf2, and sox3) at 3.3hpf and in ten genes (c-fos, cyp1b1, dazl, gstp1, mlh1, nqo1, pten, p53, sox2, and sox3) at 96hpf.

Recent studies have shown that Dab2ip also plays an important role in regulating dendrite development and neuronal migration during brain development. In this study, we provide a more complete description of the mouse Dab2ip (mDab2ip) gene locus and examined DNA methylation and expression of Dab2ip during cerebellar development. Analysis of cDNA sequences in public databases revealed a total of 20 possible exons for mDab2ip gene, spanning over 172kb. Using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data available through FANTOM5 project, we deduced five different transcription start sites for mDab2ip. Here, we characterized three different mDab2ip transcript variants beginning with exon 1. These transcripts varied by the presence or absence of exons 3 and 5, which encode a putative nuclear localization signal and the N-terminal region of a PH-domain, respectively. The 5' region of the mDab2ip gene contains three putative CpG islands (CpG131, CpG54, and CpG85). Interestingly, CpG54 and CpG85 are localized on exons 3 and 5. Bisulfate DNA sequencing showed that methylation level of CpG54 remained constant whereas methylation of CpG85 increased during cerebellar development. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the proportion of PH-domain containing mDab2ip transcripts increased during cerebellar development, in correlation with the increase in CpG85 methylation. These data suggest that site-specific methylation of mDab2ip gene during cerebellar development may play a role in inclusion of exon 5, resulting in a Dab2ip transcript variant that encodes a full pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.",2.138,1052

Here, we report that the histone methyltransferase activities of GLP and G9a are stimulated by neighboring nucleosomes that are premethylated at H3K9. These stimulation events function in cis and are dependent on the H3K9 methylation binding activities of ankyrin repeat domains of GLP and G9a. Disruption of the H3K9 methylation-binding activity of GLP in mice causes growth retardation of embryos, ossification defects of calvaria, and postnatal lethality due to starvation of the pups. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) harboring a mutant GLP that lacks H3K9me1-binding activity, critical pluripotent genes, including Oct4 and Nanog, display inefficient establishment of H3K9me2 and delayed gene silencing during differentiation.

We performed DNA methylation profiling in fat cells with the aim of identifying differentially methylated DNA sites (DMS) linked to adipose hyperplasia (many small fat cells) in post-obesity. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed in abdominal subcutaneous fat cells from 16 women examined 2 years after gastric bypass surgery at a post-obese state (body mass index (BMI) 26+/-2 kg m(-2), mean+/-s.d.) and from 14 never-obese women (BMI 25+/-2 kg m(-2)). Gene expression was analyzed in subcutaneous adipose tissue from nine women in each group. In a secondary analysis, we examined DNA methylation and expression of adipogenesis genes in 15 and 11 obese women, respectively. RESULTS: The average degree of DNA methylation of all analyzed CpG sites was lower in fat cells from post-obese as compared with never-obese women (P=0.014). A total of 8504 CpG sites were differentially methylated in fat cells from post-obese versus never-obese women (false discovery rate 1%). DMS were under-represented in CpG islands and surrounding shores. The 8504 DMS mapped to 3717 unique genes; these genes were over-represented in cell differentiation pathways. Notably, 27% of the genes linked to adipogenesis (that is, 35 of 130) displayed DMS (adjusted P=10(-8)) in post-obese versus never-obese women. Next, we explored DNA methylation and expression of genes linked to adipogenesis in more detail in adipose tissue samples. DMS annotated to adipogenesis genes were not accompanied by differential gene expression in post-obese compared with never-obese women. In contrast, adipogenesis genes displayed differential DNA methylation accompanied by altered expression in obese women.

Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 90 % of esophageal cancer cases. Genetic and epigenetic changes have been found to accumulate during the development of various cancers, including esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC). Tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are two major risk factors for ESCC, and both tobacco and alcohol were found to induce methylation changes in ESCC. Growing evidence demonstrates that aberrant epigenetic changes play important roles in the multiple-step processes of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. DNA methylation may occur in the key components of cancer-related signaling pathways. Aberrant DNA methylation affects genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage repair, Wnt, TGF-beta, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, including P16, MGMT, SFRP2, DACH1, and ZNF382. Certain genes methylated in precursor lesions of the esophagus demonstrate that DNA methylation may serve as esophageal cancer early detection marker, such as methylation of HIN1, TFPI-2, DACH1, and SOX17. CHFR methylation is a late stage event in ESCC and is a sensitive marker for taxanes in human ESCC. FHIT methylation is associated with poor prognosis in ESCC.

DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic process that modulates the gene expression levels. In cancer cells, DNA methylation may be altered in two principle ways: global DNA hypomethylation and site-specific CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a repetitive DNA retrotransposon that duplicates via a copy-and-paste genetic mechanism. Since LINE-1 constitutes a substantial portion (approximately 17 %) of the human genome, the extent of LINE-1 methylation is regarded to be a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. Measuring the level of LINE-1 methylation using pyrosequencing technology has emerged as a cost-effective and high-throughput method for assessing the global DNA methylation status. In some types of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, LINE-1 hypomethylation is strongly associated with a poor prognosis, supporting its potential role as a prognostic marker. In addition, the LINE-1 methylation level may prove to be a useful clinical biomarker for assessing the risk of cancer or predicting the chemotherapeutic efficacy of treatment in patients with GI cancers.

We obtained a detailed view of the function of DNA methylation sequence composition and distribution in the genome of B. platyphylla. There are 34,460 genes in the whole genome of birch, and 31,297 genes are methylated. Conservatively, we estimated that 14.29% of genomic cytosines are methylcytosines in birch. Among the methylation sites, the CHH context accounts for 48.86%, and is the largest proportion. Combined transcriptome and methylation analysis showed that the genes with moderate methylation levels had higher expression levels than genes with high and low methylation.

We use next-generation sequencing to assay blood DNA methylation at approximately 4.5 million loci, each comprising 2.9 CpGs on average, in 697 normal subjects. Methylation measures at each locus are tested for association with approximately 4.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to exhaustively screen for methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs). RESULTS: Using stringent false discovery rate control, 15 % of methylation sites show genetic influence. Most meQTLs are local, where the associated SNP and methylation site are in close genomic proximity. Distant meQTLs and those spanning different chromosomes are less common. Most local meQTLs encompass common SNPs that alter CpG sites (CpG-SNPs). Local meQTLs encompassing CpG-SNPs are enriched in regions of inactive chromatin in blood cells. In contrast, local meQTLs lacking CpG-SNPs are enriched in regions of active chromatin and transcription factor binding sites. Of 393 local meQTLs that overlap disease-associated regions from genome-wide studies, a high percentage encompass common CpG-SNPs. These meQTLs overlap active enhancers, differentiating them from CpG-SNP meQTLs in inactive chromatin. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic influence on the human blood methylome is common, involves several heterogeneous processes and is predominantly dependent on local sequence context at the meQTL site. Most meQTLs involve CpG-SNPs, while sequence-dependent effects on chromatin binding are also important in regions of active chromatin. An abundance of local meQTLs resulting from methylation of CpG-SNPs in inactive chromatin suggests that many meQTLs lack functional consequence.

Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) leads to transcriptional activation through recruitment of transcription activation complexes onto target genes; in contrast, methylation of histone H3K9, or histone H4K20, leads to transcriptional inactivation attracting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). It is not yet known whether jejunal induction of sucrase-isomaltase (Si) and sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (Sglt1) genes by intake of a high-starch/low-fat diet in rats is regulated by coordinated changes of these histone methylation events. In the present study, we investigated whether these histone modifications at the promoter, enhancer, and transcribed regions of Si and Sglt1 genes in rat jejunum are affected by consumption of a high-starch/low-fat diet. METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using antibodies against methylated-histone H3K4, H3K9, H4K20, and HP1 were performed at various regions associated with the Si and Sglt1 genes in jejunum of rats fed a high-starch/low-fat diet or a low-starch/high-fat diet for 7 d. RESULTS: Feeding rats the high-starch/low-fat diet induced mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3K4 on the promoter and transcribed regions of the Si and Sglt1 genes. In contrast, methylation of histones H3K9 and H4K20, and binding of HP1 at these gene regions, were not affected by the high-starch/low-fat diet. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that induction of Si and Sglt1 gene expression in rat jejunum by a high-starch/low-fat diet intake is positively associated with histone H3K4 methylation, but not with histone H3K9/H4K20 methylation, or with binding of HP1.",0,672

Here we show that in a genome-wide analysis of blood DNA methylation in 85 healthy individuals, a locus in the Kit ligand gene (KITLG; cg27512205) showed the strongest association with cortisol stress reactivity (P=5.8 x 10(-6)). Replication was obtained in two independent samples using either blood (N=45, P=0.001) or buccal cells (N=255, P=0.004). KITLG methylation strongly mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity in the discovery sample (32% mediation). Its genomic location, a CpG island shore within an H3K27ac enhancer mark, and the correlation between methylation in the blood and prefrontal cortex provide further evidence that KITLG methylation is functionally relevant for the programming of stress reactivity in the human brain. Our results extend preclinical evidence for epigenetic regulation of stress reactivity to humans and provide leads to enhance our understanding of the neurobiological pathways underlying stress vulnerability.",11.47,339

In addition, most studies to date have analyzed only a small number of CpG sites and focused on methylation changes in placentas, while data on cord blood are scarce. Our aim was to compare DNA methylation in cord blood samples from ART (N = 10) and control pregnancies (N = 8) using a genome-wide approach with the Illumina(R) Infinium Human Methylation27 array, which interrogates 27,578 CpG sites. A total of 733 (2.7%) of the CpG sites were significantly differentially methylated between the 2 groups (P < 0.05), with an overall relative hypomethylation in the ART group (P < 0.001). Differences in DNA methylation were more pronounced for CpG sites in certain types of genomic locations and were related to baseline methylation levels and distance from CpG islands and transcription start sites. ART was associated with significantly higher variation in DNA methylation, suggesting that differences in DNA methylation between cases and controls may result from stochastic (or random) genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in ART pregnancies. We identified 24 candidate genes with 2 or more CpG sites that were significantly different between the IVF and control groups. The current study provides support for the hypothesis that ART or associated subfertility may be associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, and these changes appear to be, at least in part, due to epigenetic instability in ART pregnancies. Further studies are required in order to determine the extent to which such ART-related epigenetic instability may have phenotypic consequences.",4.78,790

 association with BIBRA",2015,"Epigenetic processes, such as changes in DNA methylation, likely mediate the link between environmental exposures in utero and altered gene expression. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate imprinted genes may be especially vulnerable to environmental exposures since imprinting is established and maintained largely through DNA methylation, resulting in expression from only one parental chromosome. We used the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293, to investigate the effects of exposure to physiologically relevant doses of lead acetate (Pb) on the methylation status of nine imprinted gene DMRs. We assessed mean methylation after seventy-two hours of Pb exposure (0-25 mug/dL) using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The PEG1/MEST and IGF2 DMRs had maximum methylation decreases of 9.6% (20 mug/dL; p<0.005) and 3.8% (25 mug/dL; p<0.005), respectively. Changes at the MEG3 DMRs had a maximum decrease in methylation of 2.9% (MEG3) and 1.8% (MEG3-IG) at 5 mug/dL Pb, but were not statistically significant. The H19, NNAT, PEG3, PLAGL1, and SGCE/PEG10 DMRs showed a less than 0.5% change in methylation, across the dose range used, and were deemed non-responsive to Pb in our model. Pb exposure below reportable/actionable levels increased expression of PEG1/MEST concomitant with decreased methylation. These results suggest that Pb exposure can stably alter the regulatory capacity of multiple imprinted DMRs.",2.903,459

DNA hypermethylation is a frequent alteration in PCa, but interfocal heterogeneity of these changes has not been extensively investigated. Ten pairs of foci from multifocal PCa and 15 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples were obtained from prostatectomy specimens, resulting altogether in 35 samples. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was used to evaluate methylation status of nine tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), and a set of selected TSGs was quantitatively analyzed for methylation intensity by pyrosequencing. Promoter sequences of the RASSF1 and ESR1 genes were methylated in all paired PCa foci, and frequent (>/=75 %) DNA methylation was detected in RARB, GSTP1, and ABCB1 genes. MSP revealed different methylation status of at least one gene in separate foci in 8 out of 10 multifocal tumors. The mean methylation level of ESR1, GSTP1, RASSF1, and RARB differed between the paired foci of all PCa cases. The intensity of DNA methylation in these TSGs was significantly higher in PCa cases than in BPH (p < 0.001). Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a divergent methylation profile of paired PCa foci, while the foci from separate cases with biochemical recurrence showed similar methylation profile and the highest mean levels of DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that PCa tissue is heterogeneous, as between paired foci differences in DNA methylation status were found. Common epigenetic profile of recurrent tumors can be inferred from our data.",0,1177

In order to evaluate an evolutionary role of DNA methylation, it is essential to first gain a better insight into inheritability. To address this question, this study investigated DNA methylation variation from parents to offspring in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas using fluorescent-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) analysis. Most of parental methylated loci were stably transmitted to offspring segregating following Medelian expectation. However, methylated loci deviated more often than non-methylated loci and offspring showed a few de novo methylated loci indicating DNA methylation changes from parents to offspring. Interestingly, some male-specific methylated loci were found in this study which might help to explore sex determination in oyster. Despite environmental stimuli, genomic stresses such as polyploidization also can induce methylation changes. This study also compared global DNA methylation level and individual methylated loci between diploid and triploid oysters. Results showed no difference in global methylation state but a few ploidy-specific loci were detected. DNA methylation variation during polyploidization was less than autonomous methylation variation from parents to offspring.",3.269,1121

Previous reports have indicated that this plant does not accumulate metals in its tissue. However, low level of nickel and copper corresponding to the bioavailable levels in contaminated soils in Northern Ontario causes severe physiological damages. No differentiation between metal-contaminated and uncontaminated populations has been reported based on genetic analyses. The main objective of this study was to assess whether DNA methylation is involved in A. rubrum adaptation to soil metal contamination. Global cytosine and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analyses were carried out in A. rubrum populations from metal-contaminated and uncontaminated sites. The global modified cytosine ratios in genomic DNA revealed a significant decrease in cytosine methylation in genotypes from a metal-contaminated site compared to uncontaminated populations. Other genotypes from a different metal-contaminated site within the same region appear to be recalcitrant to metal-induced DNA alterations even >/=30 years of tree life exposure to nickel and copper. MSAP analysis showed a high level of polymorphisms in both uncontaminated (77%) and metal-contaminated (72%) populations. Overall, 205 CCGG loci were identified in which 127 were methylated in either outer or inner cytosine. No differentiation among populations was established based on several genetic parameters tested. The variations for nonmethylated and methylated loci were compared by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). For methylated loci, molecular variance among and within populations was 1.5% and 13.2%, respectively. These values were low (0.6% for among populations and 5.8% for within populations) for unmethylated loci. Metal contamination is seen to affect methylation of cytosine residues in CCGG motifs in the A. rubrum populations that were analyzed.",2.32,753

DNA methylation is altered in AD patients, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in AD pathophysiology. The objective of this study was to investigate promoter methylation levels of potential biomarkers in AD cases and controls. Peripheral blood DNA methylation levels were analysed by methylation-specific primer real-time PCR. Bdnf promoter methylation levels did not differ between AD patients and controls. Similarly, Sirt1 promoter revealed minimal levels of methylation which did not display significant differences between groups. No significant difference was revealed between AD patients and controls also in Psen1 methylation, showing a large variability of values among subjects. Although peripheral Bdnf expression is associated with differential promoter methylation in psychiatric and neurological disorders, our results suggest that different mechanisms take place in AD. The finding that the control of Sirt1 protein levels in blood is not exerted through the repression of mRNA expression by promoter hypermethylation is in agreement with previous data. In contrast, other studies reported that Psen1 methylation may be increased or decreased in AD patients, suggesting that additional studies are required. In conclusion, this study shows that peripheral levels of the potential AD biomarker proteins Bdnf, Sirt1, and Psen1 are not regulated by different promoter methylation.",2.03,10

Recent evidence points to the epigenetic and chromatin states of the genome as having important roles. METHODS: We genotyped 355 healthy young individuals for 52 known obesity-associated SNPs and obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina 450 K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category, and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n = 62; four brain regions, n = 121-133) and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n = 149). RESULTS: We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1, NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5, SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1, SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27).

Epigenetics is an emerging field that broadens the dimensions of mammalian genome blueprint. It is, unlike genetics, not only inheritable but also reversible.

Serum sclerostin and bone remodeling biomarkers were measured in two postmenopausal groups: healthy (BMD T-score > -1) and established OP (BMD T-score < -2.5, with at least one low-energy fracture). Bone specimens were used to analyze SOST mRNAs, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DNA methylation changes. The SOST gene promoter region showed increased CpG methylation in OP patients (n = 4) compared to age and body mass index (BMI) balanced controls (n = 4) (80.5% versus 63.2%, p = 0.0001) with replication in independent cohorts (n = 27 and n = 36, respectively). Serum sclerostin and bone SOST mRNA expression correlated positively with age-adjusted and BMI-adjusted total hip BMD (r = 0.47 and r = 0.43, respectively; both p < 0.0005), and inversely to serum bone turnover markers.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of SOX17 promoter methylation in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: We examined the methylation status of SOX17 promoter in 57 operable NSCLC primary tumors and paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues and in ctDNA isolated from 48 corresponding plasma samples as well as in plasma from 74 patients with advanced NSCLC and 49 healthy individuals. SOX17 promoter methylation was examined by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: In operable NSCLC, SOX17 promoter was fully methylated in primary tumors (57/57, 100%), and in corresponding ctDNA (27/48, 56.2%) while it was detected in only 1/49 (2.0%) healthy individuals. In advanced NSCLC, SOX17 promoter was methylated in ctDNA in 27/74 (36.4%) patients and OS was significantly different in favor of patients with non-methylated SOX17 promoter (p=0.012). Multivariate analysis revealed that SOX17 promoter methylation in ctDNA was an independent prognostic factor associated with OS in patients with advanced but not operable NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SOX17 promoter is highly methylated in primary tumors and in corresponding plasma samples both in operable and advanced NSCLC. In the advanced setting, SOX17 promoter methylation in plasma ctDNA has a statistical significant influence on NSCLC patient's survival time. Detection of SOX17 promoter methylation in plasma provides prognostic information and merits to be further evaluated as a circulating tumor biomarker in patients with operable and advanced NSCLC.",2.707,1285

Non-linear-distributions of methylation status and chronological age were newly fitted to the logistic curve. Notably, these distributions were revealed to be similar in 22 living blood samples and 52 dead blood samples. Therefore, the difference of methylation status between living and dead samples suggested to be ignorable by MS-HRM. Additionally, the information from ELOVL2 and FHL2 were integrated into a logistic curve fitting model to develop a final predictive model through the multivariate linear regression of logit-linked methylation rates and chronological age with adjusted R(2)=0.83. Mean absolute deviation (MAD) was 7.44 for 74 training set and 7.71 for 30 additional independent test set, indicating that the final predicting model is accurate.

We discovered extensive DNA methylation at single-base resolution in rice cultivars, identified the sequence context and extent of methylation at each site. Overall, methylation levels were significantly different in the three rice cultivars. Numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among different cultivars were identified and many of which were associated with differential expression of genes important for abiotic stress response. Transposon-associated DMRs were found coupled to the transcript abundance of nearby protein-coding gene(s). Small RNA (smRNA) abundance was found to be positively correlated with hypermethylated regions.

On the other hand, in schizophrenia male gender is strongly associated with early onset. The primary aims of the current study are: 1) to identify CpG SNPs across the genome in schizophrenia patients; and 2) to investigate gender differences in potential methylation considering the CpG SNPs at locus, gene and chromosome levels. METHODS: In this pilot analysis, we have collected detailed clinical information and DNA samples from 16 schizophrenia patients, allowing us to calculate genome-wide potential methylation at genome level in ten males and six females. This cross-sectional DNA sample included subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia that were genotyped using the Illumina Omni 2.5 Quad. We applied a novel genetic association strategy, selecting only the CpG SNPs across the genome and analyzed under additive model, to detect gender differences. The mapping analysis was conducted using a specific bioinformatic tool that we have developed, which analyzes only the polymorphic CpG sites genome wide. The bioinformatic tool can detect the SNPs that are affecting the polymorphic CpG sites across the genome. RESULTS: In the SNP-wise analysis, the top autosomal SNP was rs12619000 with 50% potential methylation in males and 95% in females (p=0.000008). In the gene-wise analysis, the KCNG3 was significantly associated with higher potential methylation in males (p=0.0004).

The cell proliferation and apoptosis was detected by MTT and Flow cytometry. RESULTS: Suppression of FOXA1 enhanced the methylation status of DAPK, MGMT, RASSF1A, p53, and depressed mRNA levels of these tumor suppressor genes, whereas over-expression of FOXA1 showed the opposite effects. DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNA were up-regulated by siRNA knock-down of FOXA1. At the same time, FOXA1 suppression promoted cell growth and inhibited apoptosis.

In general, DNA methylation in the 5'-flanking region suppresses gene expression through recruitment of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBPs) to the cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides. X-linked MeCP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2), a member of MBPs, is a methylation-associated transcriptional repressor with other functions in the central nervous system (CNS). miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Some miRNA genes harboring or being embedded in CpG islands undergo methylation-mediated silencing. One such miRNA is miR-7b which is differentially expressed through stages of neurodevelopment. In our present study, we focused on a canonical CpG island located in the 5'-flanking region of the murine miR-7b gene. Hypermethylation of this CpG island down-regulates miR-7b while recruiting MeCP2 to the methylated CpG dinucleotides. Meanwhile, Mecp2, a target of miR-7b, was up-regulated due to lack of restrain exerted by miR-7b during maturation of postnatal (PN) mouse neurons between PN3 and PN14. Our results indicate that miR-7b is a direct downstream gene transcriptional target while also being a negative post-transcriptional regulator of Mecp2 expression. We speculate that this bidirectional feed-back autoregulatory function of miR-7b and Mecp2 while linking DNA methylation and miRNA action maintains the homeostatic control of gene expression necessary during postnatal maturation of mammalian neurons.",3.37,538

 mutagenesis",2014,"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes p16(ink4a) and p19(arf)/p14(arf) by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands occurs frequently in various tumors. The aim of this study is to investigate the difference of susceptibility of methylation induced by carcinogens between p16(ink4a) and p19(arf). The methylation status of both genes was analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and bisulfite-sequencing, respectively. The expression level of P16 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that p16(ink4a) methylation was detected in the glandular stomach, small intestine and other organs of mice following X-radiation and subsequent bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but not in mock control mice. We found that the intestinal tract was the most sensitive organ for X-ray induced p16(ink4a) methylation. Loss of P16 protein expression was observed in the intestinal tissues of X-irradiated mice, but not in the mock control mice. Interestingly, p19(arf) methylation was not observed in the gastrointestinal tissues of the negative control mice following X-radiation/BMT. However, administration of N-nitrosomethylurea and/or Helicobacter felis infection promoted methylation of p19(arf) CpG islands in the gastrointestinal tracts, but did not promote p16(ink4a) methylation. In addition, p16(ink4a) methylation was detected not only in the X-irradiated GFP-negative tissue cells, but also in the GFP-positive bone marrow-derived cells that were transplanted into the BMT mice after X-radiation. In conclusion, the methylation susceptibility of p16(ink4a) and p19(arf) to carcinogen treatments was remarkably different: X-radiation indirectly induces systemic p16(ink4a) methylation, especially in the intestine; whereas N-nitrosomethylurea and/or H. felis infection induce p19(arf) methylation in their target organs.",2.415,1838

Inflammasome complex has been shown to play critical roles in inflammatory pathways in human keratinocytes. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of GA is still unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the expression of the inflammasome complex and epigenetic modification to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of GA in HaCaT cells. We evaluated NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and ASC inflammasome complex gene expression on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methylation changes were detected in these genes following treatment with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) with or without the addition of GA using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). GA inhibited the expressions of these inflammasome complex genes, and the decreases in the expressions of mRNA were reversed by 5-Aza treatment. Methylation was detected in NLRC4 and ASC on MSP, but not in NLRP3 or AIM2. GA decreased NLRC4 and ASC gene expression by increasing not only DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT-3B) protein level, but also total DNMT activity. Furthermore, silencing of DNMT-3B (shDNMT-3B) increased the expressions of NLRC4 and ASC. Our data demonstrated that GA treatment induces hypermethylation of promoters of NLRC4 and ASC genes, which may subsequently lead to the hindering of the assembly of the inflammasome complex in HaCaT cells. These results highlight the anti-inflammatory potential of GA-containing cosmetic agents in human skin cells and demonstrate for the first time the role of aberrant hypermethylation in this process.",2.055,1495

We have observed the inhibited fetal adrenal corticosterone synthesis and increased intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) rate in rats under prenatal caffeine ingestion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of prenatal caffeine ingestion on cholesterol supply in fetal adrenal steroidogenesis in rats and explore the underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Pregnant Wistar rats were treated with 60 mg/kg . d caffeine from gestational day (GD) 7 to GD17. Histological changes of fetal adrenals and increased IUGR rates were observed in the caffeine group. There were significantly decreased steroid hormone contents and cholesterol supply in caffeine-treated fetal adrenals. Data from the gene expression array suggested that prenatal caffeine ingestion caused increased expression of genes related to DNA methylation and decreased expression of genes related to cholesterol uptake. The following conjoint analysis of DNA methylation array with these differentially expressed genes suggested that scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) may play an important role in caffeine-induced cholesterol supply deficiency. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical detection certified the inhibitory effects of caffeine on both mRNA expression and protein expression of SR-BI in the fetal adrenal. And the increased DNA methylation frequency in the proximal promoter of SR-BI was confirmed by bisulfite-sequencing PCR. In conclusion, prenatal caffeine ingestion can induce DNA hypermethylation of the SR-BI promoter in the rat fetal adrenal. These effects may lead to decreased SR-BI expression and cholesterol uptake, which inhibits steroidogenesis in the fetal adrenal.",3.705,1563
26391005,An improved sequencing-based strategy to estimate locus-specific DNA methylation.,"['Brisotto G', 'di Gennaro A', 'Damiano V', 'Armellin M', 'Perin T', 'Maestro R', 'Santarosa M']",BMC cancer,2015,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional control that plays an essential role in several cellular functions. Aberrant DNA methylation in cancer has been frequently associated with downregulation of microRNAs and protein coding genes, such as miR-200c/miR-141 cluster and E-cadherin. Current strategies to assess DNA methylation, including bisulfite treatment-based assays, tend to be time-consuming and may be quite expensive when a precise appraisal is required. The Sanger-sequencing of the amplified bisulfite-treated DNA (BSP) might represent a practical option to measure DNA methylation at single CpG resolution. However, this strategy often produces noisy data, which affects accurate quantification. Here we propose an improved, reliable and cost-effective BSP-based protocol that allows proper DNA methylation assessment. METHODS: Our strategy, named normalized-BSP (NBSP), takes advantage of tailed C-balanced primers and a normalization procedure based on C/T ratio to overcome BSP-associated noise problems and nucleotide signal unbalance. NBSP was applied to estimate miR-200c/miR-141 locus methylation in serial dilution experiments and was compared to conventional methods. Besides, it was applied in the analysis of FFPE breast cancer samples and further validated in the context of the E-cadherin promoter. RESULTS: NBSP strategy outperformed conventional BSP in the estimate of the fraction of methylated cytosine in serial dilution experiments, providing data in agreement with the widely used but cumbersome cloning-based protocol. This held true for both miR-200c/miR-141 locus and E-cadherin promoter analyses. Moreover, the miR-200c/miR-141 locus methylation reflected the decrease in miRNA expression both in breast cancer cell lines and in the FFPE samples. CONCLUSIONS: NBSP is a rapid and economical method to estimate the extent of methylation at each CpG of a given locus. Notably, NBSP works efficiently on FFPE samples, thus disclosing the perspective of its application also in the diagnostic setting.",3.362,317

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in guiding the differentiation of stem cells to their destined lineage, and in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation has been well characterized as a significant contributing factor in the pathogenesis of a variety of cancers. Hematopoiesis is a process that is uniquely susceptible to epigenetic changes due to the small pool of actively cycling stem cells that give rise to the entire mature immune-hematopoietic system. Mutations in DNA methyltransferase enzymes have been shown to be initiating events in the development of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, have become targets for improved diagnostics and therapy. The spatial and temporal regulation of DNA methylation in the hematopoietic developmental hierarchy is critical to hematopoietic homeostasis. An improved understanding of the roles that DNA methylation plays in normal and malignant hematopoiesis will have a significant impact on the future of regenerative stem cell therapy and clinical treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.

METHODS: In 2012, 366 electrolysis workers in an aluminium factory were enrolled as exposure group (working years >10 and age >40 years)and divided into low-exposure group and high-exposure group based on the median serum aluminium level. Meanwhile, 102 workers in a cement plant not exposed to aluminium were enrolled as control group. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry was used to measure serum aluminium level, methylation specific PCR was used to measure the methylation rate of the promoter region of APP gene, and ELI-SA was used to measure the protein expression of APP in lymphocytes in peripheral blood. RESULTS: The exposure group had a significantly higher serum aluminium level than the control group (45.07 mug/L vs 30.51 mug/L, P< 0.01). The exposure group had a significantly lower methylation rate of the promoter region of APP gene than the control group (18.85% vs 25.49%, P=0.025), and the high-exposure group had a significantly lower methylation rate of the promoter region of APP gene than the low-exposure group (15.84% vs 21.85%, P<0.05). The exposure group had a significantly higher protein expression of APP in lymphocytes in peripheral blood than the control group (66.73 ng/ml vs 54.17 ng/ml, P<0.05); compared with the low-exposure group (65.39 ng/ml), the high-exposure group showed an increase in the protein expression of APP in lymphocytes in peripheral blood (67.22 ng/ml), but there was no significant difference between these two groups (P>0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that with reference to the control group, low aluminium exposure (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.67~3.52)and high aluminium exposure (OR=2.98, 95% CI 1.97~4.15)were risk factors for a reduced methylation rate of the promoter region of APP gene.

25550164,Dynamics of nucleosome assembly and effects of DNA methylation.,"['Lee JY', 'Lee J', 'Yue H', 'Lee TH']",The Journal of biological chemistry,2015,"The nucleosome is the fundamental packing unit of the eukaryotic genome, and CpG methylation is an epigenetic modification associated with gene repression and silencing. We investigated nucleosome assembly mediated by histone chaperone Nap1 and the effects of CpG methylation based on three-color single molecule FRET measurements, which enabled direct monitoring of histone binding in the context of DNA wrapping. According to our observation, (H3-H4)2 tetramer incorporation must precede H2A-H2B dimer binding, which is independent of DNA termini wrapping. Upon CpG methylation, (H3-H4)2 tetramer incorporation and DNA termini wrapping are facilitated, whereas proper incorporation of H2A-H2B dimers is inhibited. We suggest that these changes are due to rigidified DNA and increased random binding of histones to DNA. According to the results, CpG methylation expedites nucleosome assembly in the presence of abundant DNA and histones, which may help facilitate gene packaging in chromatin. The results also indicate that the slowest steps in nucleosome assembly are DNA termini wrapping and tetramer positioning, both of which are affected heavily by changes in the physical properties of DNA.",0,1556

In this study, we investigated the HPV-16L1 gene methylation that is detected by MS-HRM as a potential biomarker for prognosing cervical dysplasia and cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 114 HPV-16 infected patients (normal (17), CIN1 (25), CIN2 (29), CIN3 (32), SCC (11)) who underwent liquid-based cytology test and biopsy were included in this study. 17 cases with HPV-16 infection and negative cytologic and histologic results served as the control group. The HPV-16L1 gene methylation statuses of these samples were investigated using a methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) assay after bisulfite modification. RESULTS: The HPV-16L1 gene methylation statuses of all the 114 specimens were successfully detected by MS-HRM, and we observed increasing methylation levels in severe lesions, as determined using histologic assays. In addition, the methylation levels of CIN2+ (CIN2, CIN3 and SCC) were significantly higher than that of CIN2- (normal and CIN1, P<0.001). When taking CIN2+ as the reference, our HPV-16L1 DNA methylation assay achieved 91.7% sensitivity and 59.5% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present work demonstrated that HPV-16L1 gene methylation was closely associated with cervical precancerosis and cancer. Moreover, using MS-HRM to detect HPV-16L1 gene methylation may be a powerful assay for the triage of HPV-16-positive females, which could identify patients with high risk of invasive cancer.",2.275,200

We would like to establish a DNA methylation biomarker panel for bladder cancer detection in the research. METHODS: Seven candidate genes with known cancer associations were selected for this study. The DNA methylation status of the candidate genes was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assays to evaluate the relationship between bladder cancer and target gene methylation status in the urine sediments of participants. RESULTS: 112 bladder cancer patients, 10 healthy volunteers, and 17 glandular cystitis patients were enrolled. There were significant differences in the methylation status of p14ARF, RUNX3, RARbeta, DAPK, and HPP1 between the healthy control, glandular cystitis, and bladder cancer groups (p = 0.027, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.030 and p = 0.003, respectively). A panel composed of all five genes with significant methylation differences yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.936 and had 98.21% sensitivity and 88.89% specificity, while a panel using just two of these genes (RUNX3 and RARP) yielded an AUC of 0.918 with 96.64% sensitivity and 88.89% specificity. Another panel of two genes (p14ARF and HPP1) had 100% specificity, but an AUC of 0.688 and 37.50% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using the urine of bladder cancer patients and healthy controls, we assessed several novel DNA methylation biomarker panels that demonstrated good bladder cancer detection capability. Based on the results of this study we recommend the RUNX3 and RARbeta panel as the first choice for bladder cancer detection.

Although there are numerous studies on its genotoxicity, only a few studies have investigated the epigenetic changes, even less on the changes of histone modifications by AgNPs. In the current study, we probed the AgNP-induced alterations to histone methylation that could be responsible for globin reduction in erythroid cells. AgNP treatment caused a significant reduction of global methylation level for histone 3 (H3) in erythroid MEL cells at sublethal concentrations, devoid of oxidative stress. The ChIP-PCR analyses demonstrated that methylation of H3 at lysine (Lys) 4 (H3K4) and Lys 79 (H3K79) on the beta-globin locus was greatly reduced. The reduction in methylation could be attributed to decreased histone methyltransferase DOT-1L and MLL levels as well as the direct binding between AgNPs to H3/H4 that provide steric hindrance to prevent methylation as predicted by the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. This direct interaction was further proved by AgNP-mediated pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation assay. These changes, together with decreased RNA polymerase II activity and chromatin binding at this locus, resulted in decreased hemoglobin production. By contrast, Ag ion-treated cells showed no alterations in histone methylation level. Taken together, these results showed a novel finding in which AgNPs could alter the methylation status of histone. Our study therefore opens a new avenue to study the biological effects of AgNPs at sublethal concentrations from the perspective of epigenetic mechanisms.",8.557,4

The mechanism of BPA on DNA methylation is poorly understood. The present study aims to explore whether GSH synthesis affects DNA methylation in the testes of adult male rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus in response to Bisphenol A (BPA). Male G. rarus was exposed to 1, 15 and 225mugL(-1) BPA for 7 days. The levels of global DNA methylation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glutathione (GSH) in the testes were analyzed. Meanwhile, the levels of enzymes involved in DNA methylation and de novo GSH synthesis, and the substrate contents for GSH production were measured. Furthermore, gene expression profiles of the corresponding genes of all studied enzymes were analyzed. Results indicated that BPA at 15 and 225mugL(-1) caused hypermethylation of global DNA in the testes. The 15mugL(-1) BPA resulted in significant decrease of ten-eleven translocation proteins (TETs) while 225mugL(-1) BPA caused significant increase of DNA methyltransferase proteins (DNMTs). Moreover, 225mugL(-1) BPA caused significant increase of H2O2 and GSH levels, and the de novo GSH synthesis was enhanced. These results indicated that the significant decrease of the level of TETs may be sufficient to cause the DNA hypermethylation by 15mugL(-1) BPA. However, the significantly increased of DNMTs contributed to the significant increase of DNA methylation levels by 225mugL(-1) BPA. Moreover, the elevated de novo GSH synthesis may promote the DNA methylation process.",3.451,1398

VEGF-C expression was assayed by Western blotting and RT-qPCR in gastric cancer cells, and by immunohistochemistry in tumor xenografts. VEGF-C methylation was assayed by bisulfite DNA sequencing. The effect of SAM on cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry analyses and its effect on cancer growth was assessed in nude mice. The VEGF-C promoters of MGC-803, BGC-823, and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells, which normally express VEGF-C, were nearly unmethylated. After SAM treatment, the VEGF-C promoters in these cells were highly methylated and VEGF-C expression was downregulated. SAM also significantly inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

The most common etiological factor in these cases was the presence of hepatitis B alone (47.2%). Among the 56 cases that were studied, promoter methylation was detected in at least one of the genes in 27 (48.2%) cases, only in 1 gene in 13 (23.2%) cases, and in >1 gene in 14 (25%) cases. Of the 7 genes investigated, methylation was most frequently observed in MSH3, in 14 (25%) cases. Methylation of at least 1 gene was significantly more frequent in patients with single tumors than multifocal tumors. There were significant differences regarding hepatitis B status, Child Class, tumor number, grade, and TNM stage in cases where PMS2 methylation was detected. Our results suggest that methylation of genes involved in mismatch repair may be responsible in the pathogenesis of HCC, and evaluating changes in multiple genes in these pathways simultaneously would be more informative.

All study subjects had previously been characterized for mutagen sensitivity with challenge assays with ionizing radiation in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Plasma levels of folic acid, vitamin B12 and homocysteine were also available from a previous investigation. In this work DNA methylation in the promoter region of a panel of ten genes involved in cell cycle control, differentiation, apoptosis and DNA repair (p16, FHIT, RAR, CDH1, DAPK1, hTERT, RASSF1A, MGMT, BRCA1 and PALB2) was assessed in the same batches of cells isolated for previous studies, using the methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting technique. Fairly similar profiles of gene promoter methylation were observed within co-twins compared to unrelated subjects (p= 1.23 x 10(-7)), with no significant difference related to smoking habits (p = 0.23). In a regression analysis the methylation index of study subjects, used as synthetic descriptor of overall promoter methylation, displayed a significant inverse correlation with radiation-induced micronuclei (p = 0.021) and plasma folic acid level (p = 0.007) both in smokers and in non-smokers. The observed association between repair of radiation-induced DNA damage and promoter methylation suggests the involvement of the DNA repair machinery in DNA modification. Data also highlight the possible modulating effect of folate deficiency on DNA methylation and the strong influence of familiarity on the individual epigenetic profile.",2.415,671

 Institute of Mexico",2016,"INTRODUCTION: The possibility of detection of suppressor genes methylation in circulating free DNA (cf-DNA) of cancer patients and the lack of methylation in healthy individuals makes this epigenetic alternation an ideal diagnostic marker of neoplastic processes. Moreover, hypermethylation in several genes promoter was described as a biomarker of lung cancer. Methylation in the gene encoding doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is observed in patients with colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. However, there are no studies concerning DCLK1 methylation in lung cancer patients. The aims of the study was to evaluate the frequency of DCLK1 promoter methylation in cf-DNA of lung cancer patients and of healthy persons as well as the usefulness of this test for predicting the lung cancer course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCLK1 methylation status was evaluated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood plasma from 65 lung cancer patients and 95 healthy individuals. After DNA bisulfitation, DCLK1 methylation was determined using the qMSP-PCR technique. Moreover, the presence of DCLK1 methylation was correlated with the overall survival (OS) probability of lung cancer patients. RESULTS: DCLK1 promoter methylation was detected in 32 lung cancer patients (49.2 %) and 8 healthy individuals (8.4 %). The methylation of the region before transcription start site (TSS) and the region after TSS of DCLK1 gene was detected in 28 and 11 patients, respectively. In seven cases (10.8 %), the DCLK1 promoter methylation in both regions was reported simultaneously. The methylation was observed slightly frequently in patients with small cell lung cancer (75 % of SCLC patients). The median overall survival of patients with DCLK1 promoter methylation was lower than that of patients without DCLK1 gene modification (p = <0.001, HR = 4.235). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of DCLK1 promoter region methylation may be useful in both early diagnosis and prediction of the course of lung cancer.",1.522,858

We recruited 89 participants scoring < 27 (n = 47, 36 women) or > 33 (n = 42, 35 women) on the maternal care subscale of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) at a previous assessment of a larger group (N = 709, range PBI maternal care = 0-36, age range = 19-66 years; median 24 years). 85 participants gave blood for DNA methylation analyses (Sequenom(R) EpiTYPER, San Diego, CA) and cell count (Sysmex PocH-100i, Kobe, Japan). Mixed model statistical analysis showed greater DNA methylation in the low versus high maternal care group, in the BDNF target sequence [Likelihood-Ratio (1) = 4.47; p = 0.035] and in one OXTR target sequence Likelihood-Ratio (1) = 4.33; p = 0.037], but not the second OXTR target sequence [Likelihood-Ratio (1) < 0.001; p = 0.995). Mediation analyses indicated that differential blood cell count did not explain associations between low maternal care and BDNF (estimate = -0.005, 95% CI = -0.025 to 0.015; p = 0.626) or OXTR DNA methylation (estimate = -0.015, 95% CI = -0.038 to 0.008; p = 0.192). Hence, low maternal care in childhood was associated with greater DNA methylation in an OXTR and a BDNF target sequence in blood cells in adulthood. Although the study has limitations (cross-sectional, a wide age range, only three target sequences in two genes studied, small effects, uncertain relevance of changes in blood cells to gene methylation in brain), the findings may indicate components of the epiphenotype from early life stress.",0,1591

It has largely been assumed that the symmetrical nature of CpG motifs, the most common site for DNA methylation in mammals, together with the presence of maintenance methylases able to methylate newly synthesised DNA, ensures that there is concordance of methylation on both strands. However, although this assumption is compelling in theory, little experimental evidence exists that either supports or refutes this assumption. Here, we have undertaken a genome-wide single-nucleotide resolution analysis to determine the frequency with which hemimethylated CpG sites exist in sheep muscle tissue. Analysis of multiple independent samples provides strong evidence that stably maintained hemimethylation is a very rare occurrence, at least in this tissue. Given the rarity of stably maintained hemimethylation, next-generation sequencing data from both DNA strands may be carefully combined to increase the accuracy with which DNA methylation can be measured at single-nucleotide resolution.",2.207,1235

Comprehensive analyses of DNA methylation have stratified gastrointestinal cancer into several subgroups according to specific DNA methylation accumulation. In gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori infection is a cause of methylation accumulation in apparently normal mucosa. Epstein-Barr virus infection is another methylation inducer that causes more genome-wide methylation, resulting in the formation of unique epigenotype with extensive methylation. In colorectal carcinogenesis, accumulation of high levels of methylation in combination with BRAF mutation is characteristic of the serrated pathway, but not of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence through conventional adenoma. In a de novo pathway, laterally spreading tumours generate intermediate- and low-methylation epigenotypes, accompanied by different genetic features and different macroscopic morphologies. These methylation epigenotypes, with specific genomic aberrations, are mostly completed by the adenoma stage, and additional molecular aberration, such as TP53 mutation, is suggested to lead to cancer development with the corresponding epigenotype. Accumulation of DNA methylation and formation of the epigenotype is suggested to occur during the early stages of carcinogenesis and predetermines the future cancer type.",2.582,1576

Our results showed that FASN gene expression increases with age and is positively associated with adipocyte volume (r = 0.98, P < 0.01). In addition, the DNA methylation level for the first exon (0.11, CGI 3) of the FASN gene is approximately 8-fold lower than levels for its promoter (0.94, CGI 1&2) (two-way ANOVA, PCGI < 0.01).

We hypothesized that antipsychotic drugs mediate their effects by epigenetic modulation. Here, we tested the effect of an antipsychotic, olanzapine, on the DNA methylation status of genes following chronic treatment using rat-specific methylation arrays. METHODS: Forty-eight hours after the last dose of olanzapine/vehicle, rats were habituated to an open-field activity-monitoring chamber for 30 min to verify whether stress-induced locomotor activity was reduced in olanzapine-treated rats. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of olanzapine, a commonly used atypical antipsychotic drug, on the DNA methylation status of 49 genes mapped to human 22q11 and implicated in schizophrenia. Genomic DNA isolated from the cerebellum, hippocampus, and liver of olanzapine-treated (n=2) and control (n=2) rats were analyzed using rat-specific methylation arrays. RESULTS: Significantly reduced locomotor activity of olanzapine-treated rats confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of the drug administered. The effects of olanzapine have been shown through significantly increased (P<0.01) DNA methylation of genes affecting several networks mainly (i) neurological disease, inflammatory disease, and inflammatory response and (ii) cancer, cell death and survival, tumor morphology. Also, proline degradation and L-DOPA degradation were affected by olanzapine-induced DNA methylation. Further, from a set of genes in the 22q11.2 microdeletions that has been implicated previously in psychosis, 29 genes showed increased methylation following olanzapine treatment. CONCLUSION: The results showed that considerable number of genes (34/49) mapped to human 22q11 and implicated in schizophrenia were affected by olanzapine-induced DNA methylation.

Our results indicated that the initial elongation efficiency of PCR decreased with increasing DNA methylation levels in the G-quadruplex and i-motif-forming sequences.

This can lead to genetic damage through insertional mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements between non-allelic SINEs at distinct loci. SINE DNA is heavily methylated and this was thought to suppress its accessibility and transcription, thereby protecting against retrotransposition. Here we provide several lines of evidence that methylated SINE DNA is occupied by RNA polymerase III, including the use of high-throughput bisulphite sequencing of ChIP DNA. We find that loss of DNA methylation has little effect on accessibility of SINEs to transcription machinery or their expression in vivo. In contrast, a histone methyltransferase inhibitor selectively promotes SINE expression and occupancy by RNA polymerase III. The data suggest that methylation of histones rather than DNA plays a dominant role in suppressing SINE transcription.",11.47,496

Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is the pre-cancerous lesion of OSCC, whose molecular mechanisms in OSCC tumorigenesis remain largely unclear. Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in oral mucous carcinogenesis, although rare mutations of Wnt signaling molecules are found in OSCC, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism mediating aberrant Wnt/betacatenin signaling in OSCC. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) is an Wnt antagonist, and its downregulation and methylation have been reported in a number of malignancies. However, the expression and methylation of WIF1 in the development of OSF have yet to be reported. In the present study, we investigated the WIF1 expression level by immuno-histochemical staining and semiquantitative RT-PCR in normal oral, OSF and OSCC tissues, as well as the methylation status by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. The results showed that WIF1 was readily expressed in normal oral mucous tissues, but decreased gradually in OSF early, moderately advanced and advanced tissues, and was less expressed in OSCC tissues. Moreover, WIF1 was able to translocate from the nuclear to cytoplasm in OSF and OSCC tissues. Furthermore, WIF1 was frequently methylated in OSCC cases with betel quid chewing habit, but not in normal oral mucous and different stages of OSF tissues, suggesting WIF1 methylation is tumor-specific in the development of OSF. Thus, the results demonstrated that WIF1 is frequently downregulated or silenced by promoter methylation in the carcinogenesis of OSF, which serves as a potential epigenetic biomarker for the early detection of OSCC.",2.301,345
26337909,NF-kappaB: Regulation by Methylation.,"['Lu T', 'Stark GR']",Cancer research,2015,"In normal cells exposed to stress, the central transcription factor NF-kappaB is activated only transiently, to modulate the activation of downstream immune responses. However, in most cancers, NF-kappaB is abnormally activated constitutively, contributing thus to oncogenesis and tumor progression. Therefore, downregulating NF-kappaB activity is an important goal of cancer treatment. In order to control NF-kappaB activity therapeutically, it is helpful to understand the molecular mechanisms that normally govern its activation and how dysregulated NF-kappaB activity may aid the development of disease. Recent evidence from our laboratories and others indicates that, in addition to various posttranslational modifications of NF-kappaB that have been observed previously, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, NF-kappaB can be methylated reversibly on lysine or arginine residues by histone-modifying enzymes, including lysine and arginine methyl transferases and demethylases. Furthermore, these methylations are required to activate many downstream genes. Interestingly, amplifications and mutations of several such enzymes have been linked to cancer. We propose that some of these mutations may alter the methylation not only of histones but also of NF-kappaB, making them attractive therapeutic targets.",9.329,1668

Here we report a novel regulation of pRb through protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4)-mediated arginine methylation, which parallels phosphorylation. PRMT4 specifically methylates pRb at the pRb C-terminal domain (pRb C(term)) on arginine (R) residues R775, R787, and R798 in vitro and R787 in vivo. Arginine methylation is important for efficient pRb C(term) phosphorylation, as manifested by the reduced phosphorylation of a methylation-impaired mutant, pRb (R3K). A methylmimetic form of pRb, pRb (R3F), disrupts the formation of the E2F-1/DP1-pRb complex in cells as well as in an isolated system. Finally, studies using a Gal4-E2F-1 reporter system show that pRb (R3F) expression reduces the ability of pRb to repress E2F-1 transcriptional activation, while pRb (R3K) expression further represses E2F-1 transcriptional activation relative to that for cells expressing wild-type pRb. Together, our results suggest that arginine methylation negatively regulates the tumor suppressor function of pRb during cell cycle control, in part by creating a better substrate for Cdk complex phosphorylation and disrupting the interaction of pRb with E2F-1.",4.777,685

DNA methylation plays key roles in diverse biological processes such as X chromosome inactivation, transposable element repression, genomic imprinting, and control of gene expression. Recent advancements in sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling methods provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure DNA methylation in a genome-wide fashion, making it possible to comprehensively investigate the role of DNA methylation. Several methods have been developed, such as Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), and enrichment-based methods including Methylation Dependent ImmunoPrecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq), methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) protein-enriched genome sequencing (MBD-seq), methyltransferase-directed Transfer of Activated Groups followed by sequencing (mTAG), and Methylation-sensitive Restriction Enzyme digestion followed by sequencing (MRE-seq). These methods differ by their genomic CpG coverage, resolution, quantitative accuracy, cost, and software for analyzing the data. Among these, WGBS is considered the gold standard. However, it is still a cost-prohibitive technology for a typical laboratory due to the required sequencing depth. We found that by integrating two enrichment-based methods that are complementary in nature (i.e., MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq), we can significantly increase the efficiency of whole DNA methylome profiling. By using two recently developed computational algorithms (i.e., M&M and methylCRF), the combination of MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq produces genome-wide CpG methylation measurement at high coverage and high resolution, and robust predictions of differentially methylated regions. Thus, the combination of the two enrichment-based methods provides a cost-effective alternative to WGBS. In this article we describe both the experimental protocols for performing MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq, and the computational protocols for running M&M and methylCRF.",0,835

 Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine",2014,"Aberrant DNA methylation at CpG islands has been implicated as a critical player in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its biological role and clinical significance in carcinogenesis have not been clearly clarified in Chinese CRC patients. In order to examine the methylation status of cancer-related genes in CRC progression, 184 tumor tissues were collected from Chinese patients diagnosed with CRC during 2008-2011. Promoter methylation was assessed by combined bisulphite-restriction analysis, methylation-specific PCR, and bisulphite sequencing PCR . The relationship between the gene promoter methylation status and clinicopathological factors/CRC mortality was examined by using the chi-square test/Cox-proportional hazards models. Promoter hypermethylation of MLH1, p16, SFRP2, PHD3, KLOTHO, and IGFBP7 was observed in 1.6, 10.9, 97.3, 44.0, 59.8, and 88.6 % of CRC samples, respectively. KLOTHO promoter methylation reduced with age (P = 0.018) whereas p16 promoter methylation increased with age (P = 0.044) and was more frequent among males (P = 0.017). Tumor tissues (73.9 %) had concurrent methylation of two or more genes, with the most frequent combination as KLOTHO and IGFBP7 (53.8 %). Concurrent methylation of KLOTHO and IGFBP7 occurred more frequently among patients less than 70 years old (P = 0.035) and those with poor differentiation (P = 0.024). CRC-specific mortality was not associated with promoter methylation and clinicopathological features except for age (P = 0.038; risk ratio (RR), 1.96; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.04-3.70) and TNM stage (P = 0.034; RR, 3.47; 95 % CI, 1.10-10.92). Methylation frequencies of MLH1, p16, PHD3, KLOTHO, and IGFBP7 in CRC tissues were significantly higher than that in the paired normal tissues, while promoter hypermethylation of SFRP2 was widespread in normal tissues. In conclusion, we suggest that methylation of some genes (MLH1, PHD3, KLOTHO, p16, and IGFBP7) is important in CRC progression whereas SFRP2 methylation is unlikely to contribute to CRC development in Chinese patients. Besides, by identifying the characteristics of concordant methylation, we confirm the multifactorial nature of tumor progression.",0,1999

Because the kidney is a heterogeneous organ with different cell types, we investigated DNA methylation status of the kidney in a cell type-specific manner. We first identified genes specifically demethylated in the normal proximal tubules obtained from control db/m mice, and next delineated the candidate disease-modifying genes bearing aberrant DNA methylation induced by diabetes using db/db mice. Genes involved in glucose metabolism, including Sglt2, Pck1, and G6pc, were selectively hypomethylated in the proximal tubules in control mice. Hnf4a, a transcription factor regulating transporters for reabsorption, was also selectively demethylated. In diabetic mice, aberrant hypomethylation of Agt, Abcc4, Cyp4a10, Glut5, and Met and hypermethylation of Kif20b, Cldn18, and Slco1a1 were observed. Time-dependent demethylation of Agt, a marker of diabetic kidney disease, was accompanied by histone modification changes. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase increased Agt mRNA in cultured human proximal tubular cells. Aberrant DNA methylation and concomitant changes in histone modifications and mRNA expression in the diabetic kidney were resistant to antidiabetic treatment with pioglitazone.

Recent studies demonstrate that NAFLD significantly impacts on the genome wide methylation and expression reporting top hit genes to be associated with e.g. diabetes mellitus. In a targeted analysis we specifically investigate to what extent NAFLD is associated with methylation and transcriptional changes in gene networks responsible for drug metabolism (DM) and bile acid (BA) homeostasis, which may trigger liver and system toxic events. METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of 73 genes responsible for BA homeostasis and DM based on liver derived methylation and expression data from three cohort studies including 103 NAFLD and 75 non-NAFLD patients. Using multiple linear regression models, we detected methylation differences in proximity to the transcriptional start site of these genes in two NAFLD cohorts and correlated the methylation of significantly changed CpG sites to transcriptional expression in a third cohort using robust multiple linear regression approaches. RESULTS: We detected 64 genes involved in BA homeostasis and DM to be significantly differentially methylated. In 26 of these genes, methylation significantly correlated with RNA expression, detecting i.e. genes such as CYP27A1, OSTa, and SLC27A5 (BA homeostasis), and SLCO2B1, SLC47A1, and several UGT and CYP genes (DM) to be NAFLD dependently modulated.

We took samples from 108 patients with breast cancer, 28 patients with benign breast tumors, and 33 subjects with normal breast tissues at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University at Wuxi between July 2013 and September 2015. We used the samples to investigate methylation levels of the RASSF1A gene for associations with breast cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation-specific PCR were used to investigate the levels of RASSF1A mRNA expression and RASSF1A methylation, respectively. RASSFIA was not expressed in 22 of the 108 breast cancer tissue samples (20.37%), and there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05); however, RASSFIA expression was significantly lower than that in the normal breast tissue samples (P < 0.05). Moreover, the methylation rate of the RASSFIA gene promoter was significantly higher in the breast cancer tissues (64.81%) than in the normal breast tissues (18.18%) and benign breast tumors (17.86%) (P < 0.05). High methylation of the RASSF1A gene promoter was an important reason for its downregulation, and the gene played a critical regulated role in the incidence and development of breast cancer.",0.775,1440

We hypothesised that tobacco smoking modifies DNA methylation of genes previously identified for diabetes. METHODS: We annotated CpG sites available on the Illumina Human Methylation 450K array to diabetes genes previously identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and investigated them for an association with smoking by comparing current to never smokers. The discovery study consisted of 630 individuals (Bonferroni-corrected p = 1.4 x 10(-5)), and we sought replication in an independent sample of 674 individuals. The replicated sites were tested for association with nearby genetic variants and gene expression and fasting glucose and insulin levels. RESULTS: We annotated 3,620 CpG sites to the genes identified in the GWAS on type 2 diabetes. Comparing current smokers to never smokers, we found 12 differentially methylated CpG sites, of which five replicated: cg23161492 within ANPEP (p = 1.3 x 10(-12)); cg26963277 (p = 1.2 x 10(-9)), cg01744331 (p = 8.0 x 10(-6)) and cg16556677 (p = 1.2 x 10(-5)) within KCNQ1 and cg03450842 (p = 3.1 x 10(-8)) within ZMIZ1. The effect of smoking on DNA methylation at the replicated CpG sites attenuated after smoking cessation. Increased DNA methylation at cg23161492 was associated with decreased gene expression levels of ANPEP (p = 8.9 x 10(-5)). rs231356-T, which was associated with hypomethylation of cg26963277 (KCNQ1), was associated with a higher odds of diabetes (OR 1.06, p = 1.3 x 10(-5)). Additionally, hypomethylation of cg26963277 was associated with lower fasting insulin levels (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Tobacco smoking is associated with differential DNA methylation of the diabetes risk genes ANPEP, KCNQ1 and ZMIZ1. Our study highlights potential biological mechanisms connecting tobacco smoking to excess risk of type 2 diabetes.",6.671,1138

Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil leaving 5-methylcytosine unaltered, and BS-PCR was used to generate DNA template containing target CpG sites. BS-OLE uses a BS-primer hybridized immediately upstream of the target CpG site being examined and then fluorescent dCTP or dUTP is incorporated into the methylated (CpG) or unmethylated (TpG) form of the target site through single-nucleotide chain extension, yielding an FP ratio between the fluorescent dCTP- and dUTP-incorporated products as a measure of methylation. This provides stable estimates of the methylation level of human genomic DNA and of a 250-bp plasmid DNA segment containing a single TCGA TaqI cleavage site, in accordance with the results of a combined bisulfite restriction analysis method. We used BS-OLE to measure dose-dependent DNA hypomethylation in human embryonic kidney 293T cells treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC. BS-OLE is well suited to high-throughput multi-sample applications in biological and medical studies.",0,452

 Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine",2015,"Deregulation of the microRNA miR124a by DNA methylation has been implicated in various malignancies, but no study reported its methylation status in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We evaluated the methylation of the three loci encoding for miR124a using methylation-specific PCR in 64 HL patients and 15 reactive lymph nodes obtained from patients with nonmalignant diseases. Results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Methylation rates of miR124a-1, miR124a-2, and miR124a-3 in HL were 17, 50, and 28%, respectively. None of the nontumoral samples showed aberrant hypermethylation in any of the miR tested. In HL cases, we found that miR124a-1 methylation correlates with high-risk International Prognostic Score (IPS) (score >3, p = 0.04) and that miR124a-2 methylation was more frequent in children (82.3%, p = 0.006) and men (63.9%, p = 0.01). Methylation of miR124a-3 was associated with advanced Ann-Arbor stages (p = 0.007). The survival analysis showed that methylation of at least one of the miR124a genes was associated with shortened event-free survival in univariate (p = 0.03) and multivariate (p = 0.02) analyses.

In some patients (1 % in PWS and 2-4 % in AS), the disease is due to aberrant imprinting or gene silencing, or both. RESULTS: We report here a 4-year-old boy on whom a chromosomal microarray (CMA) was performed due to mild hand tremors, mild developmental delays, and clumsiness. CMA revealed absence of heterozygosity (AOH) spanning the entire chromosome 15, suggesting uniparental isodisomy 15. The patient had no definitive phenotypic features of PWS or AS. Methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) was performed to determine the parent of origin of the uniparental disomy (UPD) by examining methylation status at maternally imprinted sites. Interestingly, our patient had a mosaic methylation pattern. We identified nine additional previously tested patients with a similar mosaic methylation pattern. CMA was performed on these individuals retrospectively to test whether patients with mosaic methylation are more likely to have UPD of chromosome 15. Of the nine patients, only one had regions of AOH on chromosome 15; however, this patient had numerous regions of AOH on multiple chromosomes suggestive of consanguinity. CONCLUSION: The patients with mosaic methylation had milder or atypical features of AS, and the majority also had some features characteristic of PWS. We suggest that quantitative methylation analysis be performed for cases of atypical PWS or AS. It is also important to follow up with methylation testing when whole-chromosome isodisomy is detected.",2.14,1306

At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays (HM450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation profiles and genome-wide DNA copy number changes. Algorithms have been developed to detect the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) associated with IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT promoter methylation using a single assay. METHODS: Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n = 115 patients) of the NOA-04 trial. RESULTS: Concordance for IDH and 1p/19q status was very high: In 92% of samples, the HM450 and reference data agreed. In discordant samples, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the HM450 analysis. The HM450-derived MGMT-STP27 model to calculate MGMT promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a significantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-specific PCR, with 87 of 91 G-CIMP tumors predicted as MGMT promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of discordant samples confirmed the HM450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases. CONCLUSIONS: G-CIMP and 1p/19q codeletion are reliably detectable by HM450 analysis and are associated with prognosis in the NOA-04 trial. For MGMT, HM450 suggests promoter methylation in the vast majority of G-CIMP tumors, which is supported by pyrosequencing.",5.562,1826

Widespread differences were identified in CG and non-CG methylation marks between Cd-exposed and Cd-free rice genomes. There are 2320 non-redundant differentially-methylated regions detected in the genome. RNA-sequencing revealed 2092 DNA methylation-modified genes differentially expressed under Cd exposure. More genes were found hypermethylated than those hypomethylated in CG, CHH and CHG (where H is A, C or T) contexts in upstream, genebody and downstream regions. Many of the genes were involved in stress response, metal transport, and transcription factors. Most of the DNA methylation-modified genes were transcriptionally altered under Cd stress. A subset of loss of function mutants defective in DNA methylation and histone modification activities were used to identify transcript abundance of selected genes. Compared to wide-type, mutation of MET1 and DRM2 resulted in general lower transcript levels of the genes under Cd stress. Transcripts of OsIRO2, OsPR1b and Os09g02214 in drm2 were significantly reduced. A commonly used DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine was employed to investigate whether DNA demethylation affected physiological consequences. 5-azacytidine provision decreased general DNA methylation levels of selected genes, but promoted growth of rice seedlings and Cd accumulation in rice plant.",0,907

Staging, grading and prostate specific antigen level at surgery are helpful but still imperfect predictors of recurrence. For this reason there is an imperative need for additional biomarkers that add to the prediction of currently used prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the extent of promoter methylation of genes previously reported as aberrantly methylated in prostate cancer (AIM1, APC, CCND2, GPX3, GSTP1, MCAM, RARbeta2, SSBP2 and TIMP3) by quantitative fluorogenic methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We used cancer tissue from a nested case-control study of 452 patients surgically treated for prostate cancer. Recurrence cases and controls were compared and the association between methylation extent and recurrence risk was estimated by logistic regression adjusting for patient age at prostatectomy, prostatectomy year, stage, grade, surgical margins and preprostatectomy prostate specific antigen. All statistical tests were 2-sided with p </=0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The extent of GSTP1 methylation was higher in patients with recurrence than in controls (p = 0.01), especially patients with early disease, ie organ confined or limited extraprostatic extension (p = 0.001). After multivariate adjustment GSTP1 promoter methylation at or above the median was associated with an increased risk of recurrence, including in men with early disease (each p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Greater GSTP1 promoter methylation in cancer tissue was independently associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with early prostate cancer. This suggests that GSTP1 promoter methylation may be a potential tissue based recurrence marker.",0,1113

The aim of this study was to compare the DNA methylation status of imprinted genes and imprinting control regions (ICRs), harboring differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in a comprehensive panel of 18 somatic tissues. The germline DMRs analyzed were divided into ubiquitously imprinted and placenta-specific DMRs, which show identical and different methylation imprints in adult somatic and placental tissues, respectively. We showed that imprinted genes and ICR DMRs maintain methylation patterns characterized by intermediate methylation levels in somatic tissues, which are pronounced in a specific region of the promoter area, located 200-1500 bp from the transcription start site. This intermediate methylation is concordant with gene expression from a single unmethylated allele and silencing of a reciprocal parental allele through DNA methylation. The only exceptions were seen for ICR DMRs of placenta-specific imprinted genes, which showed low levels of methylation, suggesting that these genes escape parent-specific epigenetic regulation in somatic tissues.",4.649,608

Previous studies of blood-measured Alu/LINE-1 and cancer risk are inconsistent. METHODS: We studied 1259 prospective methylation measurements from blood drawn 1-4 times from 583 participants from 1999 to 2012. We used Cox regression to evaluate time-dependent methylation as a biomarker for cancer risk and mortality, and linear regression to compare mean differences in methylation over time by cancer status and analyse associations between rate of methylation change and cancer. RESULTS: Time-dependent LINE-1 methylation was associated with prostate cancer incidence (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.01-1.88) and all-cancer mortality (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92). The first measurement of Alu methylation (HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08-1.79) was associated with all-cancer mortality. Participants who ultimately developed cancer had lower mean LINE-1 methylation than cancer-free participants 10+ years pre-diagnosis (P<0.01). Rate of Alu methylation change was associated with all-cancer incidence (HR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.09-12.10). CONCLUSIONS: Our results add longitudinal data on blood Alu and LINE-1 methylation and cancer, and potentially contribute to their use as early-detection biomarkers.

Traditionally, DNA methylation has been considered as a permanent repressive epigenetic mark. However, the application of genome-wide approaches has allowed the analysis of DNA methylation in different genomic contexts, revealing a more dynamic regulation than originally thought, as active DNA methylation and demethylation occur during cell fate commitment and terminal differentiation. Recent data provide insights into the contribution of different epigenetic factors, and DNA methylation in particular, to the establishment of cellular memory during embryonic development and the modulation of cell type-specific gene regulation programs to ensure proper differentiation. This review summarizes published data regarding DNA methylation changes along lineage specification and differentiation programs. We also discuss the current knowledge about DNA methylation alterations occurring in physiological and pathological conditions such as aging and cancer.",3.67,629

This study was aimed at assessing whether smoking is associated with prostate tumor DNA methylation and whether these alterations may explain in part the association of smoking with PCa recurrence and mortality. METHODS: A total of 523 men had radical prostatectomy as their primary treatment, detailed smoking history data, long-term follow-up for PCa outcomes, and tumor tissue profiled for DNA methylation. Ninety percent of the men also had matched tumor gene expression data. A methylome-wide analysis was conducted to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by smoking status. To select potential functionally relevant DMRs, their correlation with the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of corresponding genes was evaluated. Finally, a smoking-related methylation score based on the top-ranked DMRs was created to assess its association with PCa outcomes. RESULTS: Forty DMRs were associated with smoking status, and 10 of these were strongly correlated with mRNA expression (aldehyde oxidase 1 [AOX1], claudin 5 [CLDN5], early B-cell factor 1 [EBF1], homeobox A7 [HOXA7], lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 [LGALS3], microtubule-associated protein tau [MAPT], protocadherin gamma A [PCDHGA]/protocadherin gamma B [PCDHGB], paraoxonase 3 [PON3], synaptonemal complex protein 2 like [SYCP2L], and zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 12 [ZSCAN12]). Men who were in the highest tertile for the smoking-methylation score derived from these DMRs had a higher risk of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-3.72) and lethal disease (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.65-11.78) in comparison with men in the lower 2 tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative molecular epidemiology study supports the hypothesis that smoking-associated tumor DNA methylation changes may explain at least part of the association between smoking and adverse PCa outcomes.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of vision loss in subjects with diabetes. However, studies examining the association between PDR and the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern are lacking. Our aim was to identify epigenetic modifications that associate with and predict PDR in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: DNA methylation was analyzed genome-wide in 485,577 sites in blood from cases with PDR (n = 28), controls (n = 30), and in a prospective cohort (n = 7). False discovery rate analysis was used to correct the data for multiple testing. Study participants with T1D diagnosed before 30 years of age and insulin treatment within 1 year from diagnosis were selected based on 1) subjects classified as having PDR (cases) and 2) subjects with T1D who had had diabetes for at least 10 years when blood DNA was sampled and classified as having no/mild diabetic retinopathy also after an 8.7-year follow-up (controls). DNA methylation was also analyzed in a prospective cohort including seven subjects with T1D who had no/mild diabetic retinopathy when blood samples were taken, but who developed PDR within 6.3 years (converters). The retinopathy level was classified by fundus photography. RESULTS: We identified differential DNA methylation of 349 CpG sites representing 233 unique genes including TNF, CHI3L1 (also known as YKL-40), CHN2, GIPR, GLRA1, GPX1, AHRR, and BCOR in cases with PDR compared with controls. The majority of these sites (79 %) showed decreased DNA methylation in cases with PDR. The Natural Killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway was found to be significantly (P = 0.006) enriched among differentially methylated genes in cases with PDR. We also identified differential DNA methylation of 28 CpG sites representing 17 genes (e.g. AHRR, GIPR, GLRA1, and BCOR) with P <0.05 in the prospective cohort, which is more than expected by chance (P = 0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with T1D and PDR exhibit altered DNA methylation patterns in blood. Some of these epigenetic changes may predict the development of PDR, suggesting that DNA methylation may be used as a prospective marker of PDR.",7.249,350

We focus on the methylation data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. One of the key issues of methylation analysis is to detect the differential methylation sites between case and control groups. Previous approaches describe data with simple summary statistics or kernel function, and then use statistical tests to determine the difference. However, a summary statistics-based approach cannot capture complicated underlying structure, and a kernel function-based approach lacks interpretability of results. RESULTS: We propose a novel method D(3)M, for detection of differential distribution of methylation, based on distribution-valued data. Our method can detect the differences in high-order moments, such as shapes of underlying distributions in methylation profiles, based on the Wasserstein metric. We test the significance of the difference between case and control groups and provide an interpretable summary of the results. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves promising accuracy and shows favorable results compared with previous methods.

However, it is not known whether HOTAIR can modulate chemoresistance in SCLC. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of HOTAIR in chemoresistance of SCLC and its possible molecular mechanism. Knockdown of HOTAIR was carried out in SCLC multidrug-resistant cell lines (H69AR and H446AR) and the parental cell lines (H69 and H446) to assess its influence on chemoresistance. The results showed that downregulation of HOTAIR increased cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs through increasing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, HOXA1 methylation increased in the resistant cells using bisulfite sequencing PCR. Depletion of HOTAIR reduced HOXA1 methylation by decreasing DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression. The interaction between HOTAIR and HOXA1 was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation. Taken together, our study suggested that HOTAIR mediates chemoresistance of SCLC by regulating HOXA1 methylation and could be utilized as a potential target for new adjuvant therapies against chemoresistance.",3.676,1833

The purpose of this study was to investigate the methylation status of MSH3 gene in esophageal cancer patients in order to further elucidate possible role of MSH3 in esophageal tumorigenesis. METHODS: We applied nested methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction to investigate the methylation status of the MSH3 promoter in tumors and matching adjacent normal-looking tissues of 84 esophageal cancer patients from a high-risk South African population. The Cancer Genome Atlas data were used to examine DNA methylation profiles at 17 CpG sites located in the MSH3 locus. RESULTS: Overall, promoter methylation was detected in 91.9 % of tumors, which was significantly higher compared to 76.0 % in adjacent normal-looking esophageal tissues (P = 0.008). When samples were grouped according to different demographics (including age, gender and ethnicity) and smoking status of patients, methylation frequencies were found to be significantly higher in tumor tissues of Black subjects (P = 0.024), patients of 55-65 years of age (P = 0.032), males (P = 0.037) and tobacco smokers (P = 0.015). Furthermore, methylation of the MSH3 promoter was significantly more frequent in tumor samples from smokers compared to tumor samples from non-smokers [odds ratio (OR) = 31.9, P = 0.031]. The TCGA data confirmed significantly higher DNA methylation level at the MSH3 promoter region in tumors (P = 0.0024). In addition, we found evidence of an aberrantly methylated putative MSH3-associated distal enhancer element. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that methylation of MSH3 together with exposure to tobacco smoke is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis. Due to the active role of the MSH3 protein in modulating chemosensitivity of cells, methylation of MSH3 should further be examined in association with the outcome of esophageal cancer treatment using anticancer drugs.",3.081,1540

These findings point towards a pathophysiological relevance of changes in DNA methylation of the LEP gene promoter region in alcohol dependence.,4.944,1730

The aim of this study was to characterize the epigenetic inactivation of Reprimo and its biologic function and clinical relevance in gastric cancer. The correlation between Reprimo methylation and clinical relevance was assessed in 83 primary human gastric cancer tissues. The effects of Reprimo expression were also examined using in vitro and in vivo assays. Reprimo methylation was cancer specific and frequently observed. In two gastric cancer cell lines without Reprimo methylation, we observed faint or weak Reprimo expression under normal conditions and high expression under DNA-damaging conditions. In four gastric cancer cell lines with Reprimo methylation, however, Reprimo expression remained faint even under DNA-damaging conditions, with expression being restored in combination with agents that induce demethylation. Enforced Reprimo expression robustly inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation and enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Inverse effects were observed via siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Reprimo. Reprimo expression inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Reprimo methylation was also associated with a poor response in patients with gastric cancer treated with chemotherapy (P(1/4) 0.028), and a poor prognosis in patients with advanced gastric cancer (P(1/4) 0.03). In conclusion, Reprimo expression is normally induced in response to DNA damage, acting as a novel tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. However, Reprimo methylation abrogates its expression and effects. The clinical assessment of Reprimo promoter methylation may serve not only as a predictive marker for chemotherapy, but also as a marker for tumor aggressiveness.",4.257,1667

Serotonin is also crucial for brain development. For instance, animal studies have demonstrated that early disruptions in the serotonin system affect brain development and emotion regulation in later life. A plausible explanation is that environmental stressors reprogram the serotonin system through epigenetic processes by altering serotonin system gene expression. This in turn may affect brain development, including the hippocampus, a region with dense serotonergic innervations and important in stress-regulation. The aim of this study was to test whether greater DNA methylation in specific CpG sites at the serotonin transporter promoter in peripheral cells is associated with childhood trauma, depression, and smaller hippocampal volume. We were particularly interested in those CpG sites whose state of methylation in peripheral cells had previously been associated with in vivo measures of brain serotonin synthesis. Thirty-three adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (23 females) and 36 matched healthy controls (21 females) were included in the study. Depressive symptoms, childhood trauma, and high-resolution structural MRI for hippocampal volume were assessed. Site-specific serotonin transporter methylation was assessed using pyrosequencing. Childhood trauma, being male, and smaller hippocampal volume were independently associated with greater peripheral serotonin transporter methylation. Greater serotonin transporter methylation in the depressed group was observed only in SSRI-treated patients. These results suggest that serotonin transporter methylation may be involved in physiological gene-environment interaction in the development of stress-related brain alterations. The results provide some indications that site-specific serotonin transporter methylation may be a biomarker for serotonin-associated stress-related psychopathology.",3.234,1166

METHODS: We searched three databases for studies that examined NR3C1 and HSD11beta1/HSD11 beta 2 methylation with maternal exposures or perinatal outcomes. Nineteen studies remained after screening. We followed Cochrane's PRISMA reporting guidelines (2009). RESULTS: NR3C1 and HSD11 beta methylation were associated with adverse infant neurobehavior, stress response, blood pressure and physical development. In utero exposure to maternal stress, nutrition, preeclampsia, smoking and diabetes were associated with altered NR3C1 and HSD11 beta methylation.

We sought to determine the frequency and relationship of methylation of key genes involved in the pathways of mitotic checkpoint control, DNA damage repair, apoptosis, and growth factor signaling in these patients. We analyzed the DNA methylation status of eight genes (CHFR, FANCF, MGMT, p16, DAPK, ASC or TMS-1, RAR-B, and CRBP1) using nested methylation-specific PCR (MSP) on over 314 paraffin-embedded, human non-small cell lung cancer samples. We determined the methylation frequency of each gene in addition to the association of the methylation of each gene with other members of the panel. Methylation was a common event in these samples. Our methylation analysis showed frequencies of methylation of 10% for CHFR, 14% for FANCF, 30% for MGMT, 29% for p16, 17% for DAPK, 33% for ASC, 38% for RAR-B, and 7% for CRBP1. There was a strong correlation between methylation of the mitotic G2-M checkpoint gene, CHFR, and methylation of other genes in our panel involved in DNA damage repair (FANCF and MGMT) and apoptosis (DAPK and ASC) but not with other genes in our panel, including p16 (the G1-S checkpoint gene), CRBP1, or RAR-B. In addition, MGMT methylation strongly correlated with the pro-apoptotic gene, ASC. There are distinct associations of methylated genes in non-small cell lung cancer involving DNA damage repair, apoptosis, and the G2-M mitotic checkpoint control. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these methylation patterns have implications for prognosis in addition to prediction of response to chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, such as radiotherapy and platinum- or taxane-based chemotherapy.",3.626,914

However, mechanisms contributing to these differences are unknown. OBJECTIVES: Among 24 maternal-infant pairs, we investigated infant sex-specific associations between placental Cd and placental genome-wide DNA methylation. METHODS: We used ANOVA models to examine sex-stratified associations of placental Cd (dichotomized into high/low Cd using sex-specific Cd median cutoffs) with DNA methylation at each cytosine-phosphate-guanine site or region. Statistical significance was defined using a false discovery rate cutoff (<0.10). RESULTS: Medians of placental Cd among females and males were 5 and 2 ng/g, respectively. Among females, three sites (near ADP-ribosylation factor-like 9 (ARL9), siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3 (SIAH3), and heparin sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 4 (HS3ST4) and one region on chromosome 7 (including carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT) and TP5S target 1 (TP53TG1)) were hypomethylated in high Cd placentas. Among males, high placental Cd was associated with methylation of three sites, two (hypomethylated) near MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus (MECOM) and one (hypermethylated) near spalt-like transcription factor 1 (SALL1), and two regions (both hypomethylated, one on chromosome 3 including MECOM and another on chromosome 8 including rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 10 (ARHGEF10). Differentially methylated sites were at or close to transcription start sites of genes involved in cell damage response (SIAH3, HS3ST4, TP53TG1) in females and cell differentiation, angiogenesis and organ development (MECOM, SALL1) in males. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study supports infant sex-specific placental Cd-DNA methylation associations, possibly accounting for previously reported differences in Cd-fetal growth associations across fetal sex. Larger studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Such investigations may further our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms underlying maternal Cd burden with suboptimal fetal growth associations.",4.373,1233

The underlying molecular mechanisms of this gene-by-environment interaction are not well understood, but epigenetic regulation including differential DNA methylation has been postulated to have a critical role. Recently, we used a maternal restraint stress paradigm of prenatal stress (PS) in 5-HTT-deficient mice and showed that the effects on behavior and gene expression were particularly marked in the hippocampus of female 5-Htt+/- offspring. Here, we examined to which extent these effects are mediated by differential methylation of DNA. For this purpose, we performed a genome-wide hippocampal DNA methylation screening using methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Promoter 1.0 R arrays. Using hippocampal DNA from the same mice as assessed before enabled us to correlate gene-specific DNA methylation, mRNA expression and behavior. We found that 5-Htt genotype, PS and their interaction differentially affected the DNA methylation signature of numerous genes, a subset of which showed overlap with the expression profiles of the corresponding transcripts. For example, a differentially methylated region in the gene encoding myelin basic protein (Mbp) was associated with its expression in a 5-Htt-, PS- and 5-Htt x PS-dependent manner. Subsequent fine-mapping of this Mbp locus linked the methylation status of two specific CpG sites to Mbp expression and anxiety-related behavior. In conclusion, hippocampal DNA methylation patterns and expression profiles of female prenatally stressed 5-Htt+/- mice suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms, some of which are promoter methylation-dependent, contribute to the behavioral effects of the 5-Htt genotype, PS exposure and their interaction.",5.62,1710

The commercially available high-throughput locus-specific pyrosequencing instruments allow for the simultaneous analysis of 96 samples, but restrict the DNA methylation analysis to CpG dinucleotide sites, which can be limiting in many biological systems. In contrast to mammals where DNA methylation occurs nearly exclusively on CpG dinucleotides, plants genomes harbor DNA methylation also in other sequence contexts including CHG and CHH motives, which cannot be evaluated by these pyrosequencing instruments due to software limitations. Here, we present a complete pipeline for accurate CpG and non-CpG cytosine methylation analysis at single base-resolution using high-throughput locus-specific pyrosequencing. The devised approach includes the design and validation of PCR amplification on bisulfite-treated DNA and pyrosequencing assays as well as the quantification of the methylation level at every cytosine from the raw peak intensities of the Pyrograms by two newly developed Visual Basic Applications. Our method presents accurate and reproducible results as exemplified by the cytosine methylation analysis of the promoter regions of two Tomato genes (NOR and CNR) encoding transcription regulators of fruit ripening during different stages of fruit development. Our results confirmed a significant and temporally coordinated loss of DNA methylation on specific cytosines during the early stages of fruit development in both promoters as previously shown by WGBS.

26458103,Dynamic m(6)A mRNA methylation directs translational control of heat shock response.,"['Zhou J', 'Wan J', 'Gao X', 'Zhang X', 'Jaffrey SR', 'Qian SB']",Nature,2015,"The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which has broad roles in RNA biology. In mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of m(6)A along mRNAs results in relatively less methylation in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) compared to other regions. However, whether and how 5'UTR methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the 5'UTR in translation initiation, very little is known about whether m(6)A modification influences mRNA translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, certain adenosines within the 5'UTR of newly transcribed mRNAs are preferentially methylated. We find that the dynamic 5'UTR methylation is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization of YTHDF2, a well-characterized m(6)A 'reader'. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear YTHDF2 preserves 5'UTR methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the m(6)A 'eraser' FTO from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased 5'UTR methylation in the form of m(6)A promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for selective mRNA translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 mRNA as an example, we demonstrate that a single m(6)A modification site in the 5'UTR enables translation initiation independent of the 5' end N(7)-methylguanosine cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of 5'UTR methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of physiological roles of m(6)A, but also uncovers a previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock response.",41.456,7

Therefore, reliable information about the methylation level of particular DNA fragments is of major interest. Herein the methylation level at two positions of the promoter region of the gene methylguanine-O(6) -DNA-Methyltransferase (MGMT) was investigated. Previously, it was demonstrated that the epigenetic status of this DNA region correlates with response to alkylating anticancer agents. An automated CGE method with LIF detection was established to separate the six DNA fragments resulting from combined bisulfite restriction analysis of the methylated and non-methylated MGMT promoter. In COBRA, the DNA was treated with bisulfite converting cytosine into uracil. During PCR uracil pairs with adenine, which changes the original recognition site of the restriction enzyme Taql. Artificial probes generated by mixing appropriate amounts of DNA after bisulfite treatment and PCR amplification were used for validation of the method. The methylation levels of these samples could be determined with high accuracy and precision. DNA samples prepared by mixing the corresponding clones first and then performing PCR amplification led to non-linear correlation between the corrected peak areas and the methylation levels. This effect is explained by slightly different PCR amplification of DNA with different sequences present in the mixture. The superiority of CGE over PAGE was clearly demonstrated. Finally, the established method was used to analyze the methylation levels of human brain tumor tissue samples.",3.028,1933

MSP, RT-PCR and western blot analysis were applied to detect the methylation status and gene expression. An MTT assay was used to detect the cell proliferation inhibition rate and flow cytometry was utilized to detect the apoptotic rate. The results showed that there was no association of the apoptotic rate with the clinicopathological characteristics for 80.6% of 36 lung squamous carcinoma patients in the methylation status (P>0.05). In the lung squamous carcinoma patients, the probability of DR4 low expression was approximately 58.3%, which may be associated with DR4 promoter methylation. The results also showed that a low expression of DR4 was correlated with the prognosis of patients. The in vitro experiments suggested DR4 genes of H226 and SK-MES-1 cells were in the methylation status and their mRNA and proteins had a low expression. Following intervention with 5-Aza-CdR, the DR4 genes of H226 and SK-MES-1 cells were in the unmethylation status and their mRNA and protein expression was significantly upregulated compared with the pre-interference ones, with differences being statistically significant (P<0.05). In addition, following interference with 5-Aza-CdR, H226 and SK-MES-1 cells became significantly sensitive to TRAIL (P<0.05). The results revealed 5-AzaCdR was able to reverse DR4 methy-lation status to upregulate its expression, thereby increasing the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung squamous carcinoma cells. Therefore, combining 5-Aza-CdR and TRAIL is a new strategy for treating lung squamous carcinoma.",2.301,415

METHODS: We performed targeted-bisulfite sequencing to determine the levels of DNA methylation of 4 CpG islands (CpG99, CpG71, CpG26, and CpG101) in the regulatory regions of PNPLA3, SAMM50, PARVB variant 1, and PARVB variant 2, respectively. We compared the levels of methylation of DNA in the livers of the first and second sets of patients with mild (fibrosis stages 0 and 1) or advanced (fibrosis stages 2 to 4) NAFLD and in those of patients with mild (F0 to F2) or advanced (F3 and F4) chronic hepatitis C infection. The hepatic mRNA levels of PNPLA3, SAMM50, and PARVB were measured using qPCR. RESULTS: CpG26, which resides in the regulatory region of PARVB variant 1, was markedly hypomethylated in the livers of patients with advanced NAFLD. Conversely, CpG99 in the regulatory region of PNPLA3 was substantially hypermethylated in these patients. These differences in DNA methylation were replicated in a second set of patients with NAFLD or chronic hepatitis C. PNPLA3 mRNA levels in the liver of the same section of a biopsy specimen used for genomic DNA preparation were lower in patients with advanced NAFLD compared with those with mild NAFLD and correlated inversely with CpG99 methylation in liver DNA. Moreover, the levels of CpG99 methylation and PNPLA3 mRNA were affected by the rs738409 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Hypomethylation of CpG26 and hypermethylation of CpG99 may contribute to the severity of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD or chronic hepatitis C infection.",11.336,361

METHODS: Expression of MeCP2 and its colocalization with cytokeratin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in surgically excised PVR membranes was studied using immunohistochemistry. The effects of 5-AZA-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC) on human RPE cell migration and viability were evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay and the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Expression of RASAL1 mRNA and its promoter region methylation were evaluated by real-time PCR and methylation-specific PCR. Effects of 5-AZA-dC on expression of alpha-SMA, fibronectin (FN), and TGF-beta receptor 2 (TGF-beta R2) and Smad2/3 phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blotting. Effect of short interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of MeCP2 on expression of alpha-SMA and FN induced by TGFbeta was determined. RESULTS: MeCP2 was abundantly expressed in cells within PVR membranes where it was double labeled with cells positive for cytokeratin and alpha-SMA. 5-AZA-dC inhibited expression of MeCP2 and suppressed RASAL1 gene methylation while increasing expression of the RASAL1 gene. Treatment with 5-AZA-dC significantly suppressed the expression of alpha-SMA, FN, TGF-beta R2 and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and inhibited RPE cell migration. TGF-beta induced expression of alpha-SMA, and FN was suppressed by knock-down of MeCP2.

In this study, we integrate Illuminate 450k DNA methylation and gene expression data to calculate the weights of gene network using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The approach considers all methylation values of CpG sites in a gene, rather than averaging them which was used in other studies ignoring the variability of the methylation sites. Through comparing topological features of control network with those of case network, including global and local features, candidate disease-associated genes and gene modules are identified. We apply the approach to real data, breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). It successfully identifies susceptibility breast cancer-related genes, such as TP53, BRCA1, EP300, CDK2, MCM7 and so forth, within which most are previously known to breast cancer. Also, GO and pathway enrichment analysis indicate that these genes enrich in cell apoptosis and regulation of cell death which are cancer-related biological processes.

METHODS: DNA methylation profiles and mRNA expression profiles were compared between two groups, six preeclampsia placentas and six normal pregnancy placentas using microarrays. RESULTS: The number of promoters with altered DNA methylation was 1664. The number of mRNA identified as differentially expressed between the two groups of placenta samples were 1446. And the number of matched genes with a typical relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression was 42 hypomethylated DNA with increased mRNA expression and 19 hypermethylated DNA with decreased mRNA expression. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and GO analysis were constructed based on the correlation between the differentially expressed DNA methylation and mRNAs.

We report here that the activities of two Dnmt2 homologs, Pmt1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and DnmA from Dictyostelium discoideum, are strongly stimulated by prior queuosine (Q) modification of the substrate tRNA. In vivo tRNA methylation levels were stimulated by growth of cells in queuine-containing medium; in vitro Pmt1 activity was enhanced on Q-containing RNA; and queuine-stimulated in vivo methylation was abrogated by the absence of the enzyme that inserts queuine into tRNA, eukaryotic tRNA-guanine transglycosylase. Global analysis of tRNA methylation in S. pombe showed a striking selectivity of Pmt1 for tRNA(Asp) methylation, which distinguishes Pmt1 from other Dnmt2 homologs. The present analysis also revealed a novel Pmt1- and Q-independent tRNA methylation site in S. pombe, C34 of tRNA(Pro). Notably, queuine is a micronutrient that is scavenged by higher eukaryotes from the diet and gut microflora.

This study aimed to characterize tanshinol methylation. METHODS: Metabolites of tanshinol were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Metabolism was assessed in vitro with rat and human enzymes. The major metabolites were synthesized for studying their interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and their vasodilatory properties. Dose-related tanshinol methylation and its influences on tanshinol pharmacokinetics were also studied in rats. RESULTS: Methylation, preferentially in the 3-hydroxyl group, was the major metabolic pathway of tanshinol. In rats, tanshinol also underwent considerable 3-O-sulfation, which appeared to be poor in human liver. These metabolites were mainly eliminated via renal excretion, which involved tubular secretion mainly by organic anion transporter (OAT) 1. The methylated metabolites had no vasodilatory activity. Entacapone-impaired methylation did not considerably increase systemic exposure to tanshinol in rats. The saturation of tanshinol methylation in rat liver could be predicted from the Michaelis constant of tanshinol for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Tanshinol had low affinity for human COMT and OATs; its methylated metabolites also had low affinity for the transporters. Tanshinol and its major human metabolite (3-O-methyltanshinol) exhibited negligible inhibitory activities against human cytochrome P450 enzymes, organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1/1B3, multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, and breast cancer resistance protein. CONCLUSION: Tanshinol is mainly metabolized via methylation. Tanshinol and its major human metabolite have low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with synthetic antianginal agents. This study will help define the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia related to tanshinol methylation.",2.912,52

We previously revealed genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with esophageal SCCs in relation to clinical outcome, including mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, p53 expression, and long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, a surrogate marker for global DNA methylation level. In this study, we explored these features in BSCC. METHODS: A database of 502 esophageal cancers was used to evaluate the clinical and molecular characteristics of BSCC. KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations and LINE-1 methylation were analyzed by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Of 502 tumors, 22 (4.4 %) were pathologically diagnosed as BSCC, and 440 (87 %) as SCC. No prognostic differences between BSCC and SCC cases were identified (p = 0.41). KRAS or BRAF mutations were not observed in BSCCs. While 23 % of SCC tumors harbored a PIK3CA mutation, all BSCC cases were wild-type for PIK3CA (p = 0.002), and there were no differences in p53 expression between BSCCs and SCCs (p = 0.57), as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, BSCC tissues exhibited significantly lower levels of LINE-1 methylation than SCC tissues (p < 0.0001).

During mammalian development, two global demethylation events are followed by waves of de novo DNA methylation. In vivo mechanisms of DNA methylation establishment are largely uncharacterized. Here, we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a system lacking DNA methylation to define the chromatin features influencing the activity of the murine DNMT3B. Our data demonstrate that DNMT3B and H3K4 methylation are mutually exclusive and that DNMT3B is co-localized with H3K36 methylated regions. In support of this observation, DNA methylation analysis in yeast strains without Set1 and Set2 shows an increase of relative 5(me)C levels at the transcription start site and a decrease in the gene-body, respectively. We extend our observation to the murine male germline, where H3K4me3 is strongly anti-correlated while H3K36me3 correlates with accelerated DNA methylation. These results show the importance of H3K36 methylation for gene-body DNA methylation in vivo.",9.322,455

However, epigenetic regulation has not been thoroughly studied. Our goal was to generate DNA methylation profiles of murine/human MTHFR gene regions and examine methylation in brain and liver tumors. Pyrosequencing in four murine tissues revealed minimal DNA methylation in the CpG island. Higher methylation was seen in liver or intestine in the CpG island shore 5' to the upstream translational start site or in another region 3' to the downstream start site. In the latter region, there was negative correlation between expression and methylation. Three orthologous regions were investigated in human MTHFR, as well as a fourth region between the two translation start sites. We found significantly increased methylation in three regions (not the CpG island) in pediatric astrocytomas compared with control brain, with decreased expression in tumors. Methylation in hepatic carcinomas was also increased in the three regions compared with normal liver, but the difference was significant for only one CpG. This work, the first overview of the Mthfr/MTHFR epigenetic landscape, suggests regulation through methylation in some regions, demonstrates increased methylation/decreased expression in pediatric astrocytomas, and should serve as a resource for future epigenetic studies.",0,1324

Our previous work found that PRL-3 is highly overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC) tissue with peritoneal metastasis and directly involved in the pathogenesis of GC peritoneal metastasis. Moreover, we further found that the down-regulation of endogenous miR-495 expression plays a causative role in over expression of PRL-3 in GC peritoneal metastasis. However, the molecular regulation mechanisms by which endogenous miR-495 expression is down-regulated and PRL-3 promotes GC peritoneal metastasis remain to be clearly elucidated. Some studies have shown that the promoter methylation is closely related to the miRNA gene expression. Therefore, in present study, based on our previous findings, we will analysis whether DNA methylation is a major cause of the down-expression of endogenous miR-495, which results in PRL-3 overexpression in GC peritoneal metastasis. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) and sodium bisulfite sequencing method (BSP) detected miR-495 gene promoter methylation status. We treated GC cell lines with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) to make the gene promoter methylation inactivation. By treating with 5-Aza-dC the migration and invasion of GC cells were significantly inhibited. And the miR-495 was overexpressing, corresponds to the mRNA and protein levels of PRL-3 were reduced, the ability of invasion and metastasis was inhibited. This study suggest that miR-495 have tumor suppressor properties and are partially silenced by DNA hypermethylation in GC, will provide new strategies for prevention and treatment of GC peritoneal metastasis.",2.297,1186
26510534,Changes in correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression in cancer.,"['Moarii M', 'Boeva V', 'Vert JP', 'Reyal F']",BMC genomics,2015,"BACKGROUND: Methylation of high-density CpG regions known as CpG Islands (CGIs) has been widely described as a mechanism associated with gene expression regulation. Aberrant promoter methylation is considered a hallmark of cancer involved in silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes. However, recent studies have also challenged the simple model of gene expression control by promoter methylation in cancer, and the precise mechanism of and role played by changes in DNA methylation in carcinogenesis remains elusive. RESULTS: Using a large dataset of 672 matched cancerous and healthy methylomes, gene expression, and copy number profiles accross 3 types of tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we perform a detailed meta-analysis to clarify the interplay between promoter methylation and gene expression in normal and cancer samples. On the one hand, we recover the existence of a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) with prognostic value in a subset of breast, colon and lung cancer samples, where a common subset of promoter CGIs hypomethylated in normal samples become hypermethylated. However, this hypermethylation is not accompanied by a decrease in expression of the corresponding genes, which are already lowly expressed in the normal genes. On the other hand, we identify tissue-specific sets of genes, different between normal and cancer samples, whose inter-individual variation in expression is significantly correlated with the variation in methylation of the 3' flanking regions of the promoter CGIs. These subsets of genes are not the same in the different tissues, nor between normal and cancerous samples, but transcription factors are over-represented in all subsets. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that epigenetic reprogramming in cancer does not contribute to cancer development via direct inhibition of gene expression through promoter hypermethylation. It may instead modify how the expression of a few specific genes, particularly transcription factors, are associated with DNA methylation variations in a tissue-dependent manner.",3.986,268

Methylation plays a role in the diversity and stability of anthocyanins. However, the contribution of anthocyanin methylation to flower coloration is still unclear. We identified two homologous anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT) genes from purple-flowered (PsAOMT) and red-flowered (PtAOMT) Paeonia plants, and we performed functional analyses of the two genes in vitro and in vivo. The critical amino acids for AOMT catalytic activity were studied by site-directed mutagenesis. We showed that the recombinant proteins, PsAOMT and PtAOMT, had identical substrate preferences towards anthocyanins. The methylation activity of PsAOMT was 60 times higher than that of PtAOMT in vitro. Interestingly, this vast difference in catalytic activity appeared to result from a single amino acid residue substitution at position 87 (arginine to leucine). There were significant differences between the 35S::PsAOMT transgenic tobacco and control flowers in relation to their chromatic parameters, which further confirmed the function of PsAOMT in vivo. The expression levels of the two homologous AOMT genes were consistent with anthocyanin accumulation in petals. We conclude that AOMTs are responsible for the methylation of cyanidin glycosides in Paeonia plants and play an important role in purple coloration in Paeonia spp.",5.526,121

B cell defects lead to diseases such as leukemia and lymphomas. Histone arginine methylation is important for regulating gene activation and silencing in cells. Although the process commonly exists in mammalian cells, its roles in B cells are unknown. To explore the effects of aberrant histone arginine methylation on B cells, we generated mice with a B cell-specific knockout of PRMT7, a member of the methyltransferases that mediate arginine methylation of histones. In this article, we showed that the loss of PRMT7 led to decreased mature marginal zone B cells and increased follicular B cells and promoted germinal center formation after immunization. Furthermore, mice lacking PRMT7 expression in B cells secreted low levels of IgG1 and IgA. Abnormal expression of germinal center genes (i.e., Bcl6, Prdm1, and Irf4) was detected in conditional knockout mice. By overexpressing PRMT7 in the Raji and A20 cell lines derived from B cell lymphomas, we validated the fact that PRMT7 negatively regulated Bcl6 expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR, we found that PRMT7 could recruit H4R3me1 and symmetric H4R3me2 to the Bcl6 promoter. These results provide evidence for the important roles played by PRMT7 in germinal center formation.",1.82,461

Here we use three imprinted genes, OsYUCCA11, yellow2-like and ubiquitin hydrolase, to show that differential DNA methylation and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3 ) in the promoter and/or gene body influences allele-specific expression or the site of transcript initiation. Paternal expression of OsYUCCA11 required DNA methylation in the gene body whereas the gene body of the silenced maternal allele was hypomethylated and marked with H3K27me3 . These differential markings mirror those proposed to modulate paternal expression of two Arabidopsis genes, PHERES1 and a YUCCA homolog, indicating conservation of imprinting mechanisms. At yellow2-like, DNA hypomethylation in the upstream flanking region resulted in maternal transcripts that were longer than paternal transcripts; the maternal transcript initiation site was marked by DNA methylation in the paternal allele, and transcription initiated ~700 bp downstream. The paternal allele of an ubiquitin hydrolase gene exhibited gene body DNA methylation and produced full-length transcripts, while the maternal allele was hypomethylated in the 5' gene body and transcripts initiated from a downstream promoter. Inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-azacytidine or zebularine activated the long transcripts from yellow2-like and enhanced expression of the short transcripts from the ubiquitin hydrolase in seedlings, indicating that DNA methylation prevents transcript initiation from cryptic promoters. These observations suggest a paradigm whereby maternal genome hypomethylation is associated with the production of distinct transcripts, potentially diversifying the gene products from the two alleles.",0,305

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods were used respectively to detect the role of RASSF5A, RASSF5B, and RASSF5C in 132 GCA cases and BS-MSP method was used to clarify the critical CpG sites of RASSF5A. Expression of RASSF5A and RASSF5C transcripts were easily detectable in all normal gastric cardia epithelial tissues; however, expression of RASSF5B was rare detected in normal gastric cardia epithelial tissues and tumor tissues. Both RASSF5A and RASSF5C expression were frequently downregulated in GCA tumor tissues and RASSF5A was more commonly down-regulated compared to RASSF5C. Abnormal reduction of RASSF5A was more commonly observed in advanced stage and poor differentiated tumors. The methylation frequency of CpG island 1 region of RASSF5A in GCA tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues and was inversely correlated with RASSF5A expression. Aberrant promoter methylation of RASSF5C was not found in GCA. RASSF5A methylation and protein expression were independently associated with GCA patients' survival. These results indicate that down-regulation of RASSF5A and RASSF5C expression is a tumor-specific phenomenon and RASSF5A may be a more common target for inactivation in GCA. Inactivation of RASSF5A through CpG island 1 methylation may play an important role in GCA carcinogenesis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker for GCA.",4.808,341

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic signature of protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) promoter methylation in curatively resected pathological stage I NSCLC. Using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assays, methylation of PCDH10 promoter was assessed in cancer tissues of 109 patients who underwent curative resection of pathological stage I NSCLC. Associations between PCDH10 methylation status and disease outcome was analyzed. PCDH10 promoter methylation was detected in 46/109 patients (42.2%). Patients with methylated PCDH10 showed significantly worse recurrence-free, overall, and disease-specific survival compared with those without methylation (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0004, P = 0.0002, respectively). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that adjusted hazard ratios of methylated PCDH10 were 5.159 for recurrence-free, 1.817 for overall, and 5.478 for disease-specific survival (P = 0.0005, P = 0.1475, P = 0.0109, respectively). The pattern of recurrence was not significantly different between patients with and without PCDH10 methylation (P = 0.5074). PCDH10 methylation is a potential biomarker that predicts a poor prognosis after curative resection of pathological stage I NSCLC. Assessment of PCDH10 methylation status might assist in patient stratification for determining an appropriate adjuvant treatment and follow-up strategy.",2.5,155

Adipose tissue plays a key role in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction, and gastric bypass provides a model to investigate obesity and weight loss in humans. RESULTS: Here, we investigate DNA methylation in adipose tissue from obese women before and after gastric bypass and significant weight loss. In total, 485,577 CpG sites were profiled in matched, before and after weight loss, subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue. A paired analysis revealed significant differential methylation in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue. A greater proportion of CpGs are hypermethylated before weight loss and increased methylation is observed in the 3' untranslated region and gene bodies relative to promoter regions. Differential methylation is found within genes associated with obesity, epigenetic regulation and development, such as CETP, FOXP2, HDAC4, DNMT3B, KCNQ1 and HOX clusters. We identify robust correlations between changes in methylation and clinical trait, including associations between fasting glucose and HDAC4, SLC37A3 and DENND1C in subcutaneous adipose. Genes investigated with differential promoter methylation all show significantly different levels of mRNA before and after gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting global DNA methylation profiling of adipose tissue before and after gastric bypass and associated weight loss. It provides a strong basis for future work and offers additional evidence for the role of DNA methylation of adipose tissue in obesity.",10.81,1213

Here, we identified HCC risk factors that are associated with DNA methylation in the background liver tissue of NBNC-HCC patients. METHODS: We performed methylation analysis in 37 pairs of virus-positive and 22 pairs of NBNC-HCC and non-cancerous livers using a HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. After the selection of differentially methylated CpGs (DM-CpGs) in cancerous and non-cancerous livers, we analyzed DNA methylation of DM-CpGs within the adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue that is affected by specific HCC risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 38,331 CpGs were selected as DM-CpGs using the following criteria: difference of beta-value between HCC and non-cancerous liver >/=0.15 and false discovery rate (FDR) q < 1.0E-12. We subsequently selected the DM-CpGs that had methylation differences with the background liver tissue (that has FDR q < 0.35). Among the virus-positive patients, the type of hepatitis virus was mostly associated with differences in methylation within the background liver tissues. However, we found that background methylation patterns were most significantly associated with aging in NBNC patients. Interestingly, age-related methylation differences in DM-CpGs were also observed in NBNC-HCC tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis viruses affect the methylation profiles within background liver tissues. However, difference in background methylation was mostly associated with age in NCBC-HCC patients; some age-related methylation events could contribute to emergence of NBNC-HCC in elderly individuals.",2.181,290

At present, there is a lack of data on the possible role of angiogenesis and its molecular mechanism in preterm pregnancy. We have previously reported reduced placental global DNA methylation levels in preterm pregnancy. Now, we have extended the study to examine plasma levels of angiogenic factors from maternal and cord blood and correlate them with placental promoter CpG methylation and messenger RNA expression of these angiogenic genes in preterm pregnancies. METHODS: We recruited 99 women delivering at term and 90 women delivering preterm. Plasma levels of angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT-1), and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels and promoter CpG methylation of angiogenic genes in placentae were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and by the Sequenom EpiTYPER technology, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal VEGF and PlGF levels (P < .01 for both) were lower but soluble FLT-1 (sFLT-1) levels and sFLT-1-PlGF ratio (P < .05 for both) were higher in the preterm group. Placental VEGF expression (P < .05) was lower, and CpG site 14 in the VEGF promoter was hypermethylated (P < .05) in the preterm group. The KDR expression (P < .05) was higher in women delivering preterm.

Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understand the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. In this study, we proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757 887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, we identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner. In particular, we observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks are associated with the cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.",9.112,987

Neuroinflammation may possibly play a role. Inducible nitric oxide synthase, coded by NOS2, is involved in inflammation, and particulate exposure increases the gene's expression through methylation of CpG sites in the 5' region. METHODS: We assessed DNA methylation at three CpG sites in the NOS2 exon 1 from blood from 201 welders. All were non-Hispanic Caucasian men 25-65 years old who were examined by a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. We categorized the workers according to their Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor subsection 3 (UPDRS3) scores as parkinsonism cases (UPDRS3 >/= 15; n = 49), controls (UPDRS3 < 6; n = 103), or intermediate (UPDRS3 >/= 6 to < 15; n = 49). RESULTS: While accounting for age, examiner and experimental plate, parkinsonism cases had lower mean NOS2 methylation than controls (p-value for trend = 0.04), specifically at CpG site 8329 located in an exonic splicing enhancer of NOS2 (p-value for trend = 0.07). These associations were not observed for the intermediate UPDRS3 group (both p-value for trend >/= 0.59).

25592537,Function and information content of DNA methylation.,['Schubeler D'],Nature,2015,"Cytosine methylation is a DNA modification generally associated with transcriptional silencing. Factors that regulate methylation have been linked to human disease, yet how they contribute to malignances remains largely unknown. Genomic maps of DNA methylation have revealed unexpected dynamics at gene regulatory regions, including active demethylation by TET proteins at binding sites for transcription factors. These observations indicate that the underlying DNA sequence largely accounts for local patterns of methylation. As a result, this mark is highly informative when studying gene regulation in normal and diseased cells, and it can potentially function as a biomarker. Although these findings challenge the view that methylation is generally instructive for gene silencing, several open questions remain, including how methylation is targeted and recognized and in what context it affects genome readout.",41.456,1598

Colonic biopsy samples were obtained endoscopically from 10 normal, 23 adenoma (17 low-grade (LGD) and 6 high-grade dysplasia (HGD)), and 8 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (4 active and 4 inactive). CRC samples were obtained from 24 patients (17 primary, 7 metastatic (MCRC)), 7 of them with synchronous LGD. Field effects were analyzed in tissues 1 cm (n = 5) and 10 cm (n = 5) from the margin of CRC. Tissue materials were studied for DNA methylation status using a 96 gene panel and for KRAS and BRAF mutations. Expression levels were assayed using whole genomic mRNA arrays. SFRP1 was further examined by immunohistochemistry. HT29 cells were treated with 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine to analyze the reversal possibility of DNA methylation. More than 85% of tumor samples showed hypermethylation in 10 genes (SFRP1, SST, BNC1, MAL, SLIT2, SFRP2, SLIT3, ALDH1A3, TMEFF2, WIF1), whereas the frequency of examined mutations were below 25%. These genes distinguished precancerous and cancerous lesions from inflamed and healthy tissue. The mRNA alterations that might be caused by systematic methylation could be partly reversed by demethylation treatment. Systematic changes in methylation patterns were observed early in CRC carcinogenesis, occuring in precursor lesions and CRC. Thus we conclude that DNA hypermethylation is an early and systematic event in colorectal carcinogenesis, and it could be potentially reversed by systematic demethylation therapy, but it would need more in vitro and in vivo experiments to support this theory.",3.234,1652
24661787,The CHH motif in sugar beet satellite DNA: a modulator for cytosine methylation.,"['Zakrzewski F', 'Schubert V', 'Viehoever P', 'Minoche AE', 'Dohm JC', 'Himmelbauer H', 'Weisshaar B', 'Schmidt T']",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2014,"Methylation of DNA is important for the epigenetic silencing of repetitive DNA in plant genomes. Knowledge about the cytosine methylation status of satellite DNAs, a major class of repetitive DNA, is scarce. One reason for this is that arrays of tandemly arranged sequences are usually collapsed in next-generation sequencing assemblies. We applied strategies to overcome this limitation and quantified the level of cytosine methylation and its pattern in three satellite families of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) which differ in their abundance, chromosomal localization and monomer size. We visualized methylation levels along pachytene chromosomes with respect to small satellite loci at maximum resolution using chromosome-wide fluorescent in situ hybridization complemented with immunostaining and super-resolution microscopy. Only reduced methylation of many satellite arrays was obtained. To investigate methylation at the nucleotide level we performed bisulfite sequencing of 1569 satellite sequences. We found that the level of methylation of cytosine strongly depends on the sequence context: cytosines in the CHH motif show lower methylation (44-52%), while CG and CHG motifs are more strongly methylated. This affects the overall methylation of satellite sequences because CHH occurs frequently while CG and CHG are rare or even absent in the satellite arrays investigated. Evidently, CHH is the major target for modulation of the cytosine methylation level of adjacent monomers within individual arrays and contributes to their epigenetic function. This strongly indicates that asymmetric cytosine methylation plays a role in the epigenetic modification of satellite repeats in plant genomes.",0,1957

The former is frequently inactivated, while the latter is overexpressed in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Hypomethylation of PRDM1beta CpG islands was preferentially detected in lymphoma cells. However, both high and low methylation of PRDM1alpha CpG islands was simultaneously observed in cases of DLBCL compared with the moderate methylation of non-tumor cases. CpG 16-21-specific high methylation was correlated with low expression of PRDM1alpha in PRDM1beta-positive DLBCL samples. Three increased and one decreased miRNAs were significantly different between cases of DLBCL and non-tumor reactive hyperplasia. Thus, our results indicate that aberrant methylation silencing of PRDM1alpha and hypomethylation activation of PRDM1beta are frequent events in DLBCL.",2.891,1225
24885596,Mathematical modeling of the effects of glutathione on arsenic methylation.,"['Lawley SD', 'Yun J', 'Gamble MV', 'Hall MN', 'Reed MC', 'Nijhout HF']",Theoretical biology & medical modelling,2014,"BACKGROUND: Arsenic is a major environmental toxin that is detoxified in the liver by biochemical mechanisms that are still under study. In the traditional metabolic pathway, arsenic undergoes two methylation reactions, each followed by a reduction, after which it is exported and released in the urine. Recent experiments show that glutathione plays an important role in arsenic detoxification and an alternative biochemical pathway has been proposed in which arsenic is first conjugated by glutathione after which the conjugates are methylated. In addition, in rats arsenic-glutathione conjugates can be exported into the plasma and removed by the liver in the bile. METHODS: We have developed a mathematical model for arsenic biochemistry that includes three mechanisms by which glutathione affects arsenic methylation: glutathione increases the speed of the reduction steps; glutathione affects the activity of arsenic methyltranferase; glutathione sequesters inorganic arsenic and its methylated downstream products. The model is based as much as possible on the known biochemistry of arsenic methylation derived from cellular and experimental studies. RESULTS: We show that the model predicts and helps explain recent experimental data on the effects of glutathione on arsenic methylation. We explain why the experimental data imply that monomethyl arsonic acid inhibits the second methylation step. The model predicts time course data from recent experimental studies. We explain why increasing glutathione when it is low increases arsenic methylation and that at very high concentrations increasing glutathione decreases methylation. We explain why the possible temporal variation of the glutathione concentration affects the interpretation of experimental studies that last hours. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model aids in the interpretation of data from recent experimental studies and shows that the Challenger pathway of arsenic methylation, supplemented by the glutathione effects described above, is sufficient to understand and predict recent experimental data. More experimental studies are needed to explicate the detailed mechanisms of action of glutathione on arsenic methylation. Recent experimental work on the effects of glutathione on arsenic methylation and our modeling study suggest that supplements that increase hepatic glutathione production should be considered as strategies to reduce adverse health effects in affected populations.",0.25,628

Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in lung homeostasis and immunity, and is encoded by two genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2). The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated CpG sites in the promoter region of the SFTPA2 gene in lung cancer tissue, and to determine the correlation between the promoter's methylation profile and gene expression. For this, we collected 28 pairs of cancerous human lung tissue and adjacent noncancerous (NC) lung tissue: 17 adenocarcinoma (AC), 9 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 2 AC with SCC features, and we evaluated DNA methylation of the SFTPA2 promoter region by bisulfite conversion. Our results identified a higher methylation ratio in one CpG site of the SFTPA2 gene in cancerous tissue versus NC tissue (0.36 versus 0.11, p = 0.001). When assessing AC samples, we also found cancerous tissues associated with a higher methylation ratio (0.43 versus 0.10, p = 0.02). In the SCC group, although cancerous tissue showed a higher methylation ratio (0.22 versus 0.11), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.35). Expression of SFTPA2 mRNA and total SP-A protein was significantly lower in cancer tissue when compared to adjacent NC tissue (p < 0.001), and correlated with the hypermethylated status of an SFTPA2 CpG site in AC samples. The findings of this pilot study may hold promise for future use of SFTPA2 as a biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer.",1.41,573

METHODS: Among the 4,364 Uyghur women, specimens were collected from 145 (3.3%) HPV-16 single infected cases, which were divided into 5 groups: transient infection (n = 32), persistent infection (n = 21, 12 months), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 (CIN1, n = 21), CIN2-3 (n = 33) and invasive cervical cancer (n = 38) groups. Methylation level in HPV-16 L1 was quantified by pyrosequencing, and values in the prediction and diagnosis of CIN2+ lesions were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: With the progression of the disease, increased methylation was detected at 13 CpG sites, and a high methylation level was associated with the risk of CIN2+. The strongest related site was 6650 (OR 9.89, 95% CI 3.57-27.44). The area under ROC curve (AUC) of methylation at each CpG site to differentiate between CIN2+ and <CIN2 ranged from 0.756 to 0.862, and the greatest AUC was at position 6650 (AUC 0.862, 95% CI 0.803-0.920). A high methylation level at CpG site 6389, 6457, 6581, 6650, 6796 and 7034 was connected with increased risk of HPV-persistent infection, and the strongest associated CpG site was 6389 (OR 13.33, 95% CI 3.95-28.08). The AUC in the prediction of HPV persistent infection was in the range of 0.656-0.943 and the site with the highest diagnostic value was 6389 (AUC 0.943, 95% CI 0.884-1.000).

Protein arginine methylation can be identified and/or determined via proteomic approaches, and/or immunoblotting with methyl-arginine specific antibodies. However, these techniques sometimes can be misleading and often provide false positive results. Most importantly, these techniques cannot provide direct evidence in support of the PRMT substrate specificity. In vitro methylation assays, on the other hand, are useful biochemical assays, which are sensitive, and consistently reveal if the identified proteins are indeed PRMT substrates. A typical in vitro methylation assay includes purified, active PRMTs, purified substrate and a radioisotope labeled methyl donor (S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-(3)H] methionine). Here we describe a step-by-step protocol to isolate catalytically active PRMT1, a ubiquitously expressed PRMT family member. The methyl transferase activities of the purified PRMT1 were later tested on Ras-GTPase activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a known PRMT substrate, in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-(3)H] methionine as the methyl donor. This protocol can be employed not only for establishing the methylation status of novel physiological PRMT1 substrates, but also for understanding the basic mechanism of protein arginine methylation.",0.575,260

The subjects were 308 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutation was observed in 135 of the 308 cases (43.8%). acute myeloid leukemia associated with DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutation was more frequent in older patients (p<0.0001), and in patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk (p<0.0001) accompanied by high white blood cell count (p=0.0032).

Previous studies suggested a link between the lysine methyltransferase EHMT2 (also known as G9A and KMT1C) and DNA methylation in the mouse. Here, we used a model of knockout mice to explore the role of EHMT2 in DNA methylation during mouse embryogenesis. The Ehmt2 gene is expressed in epiblast cells but is dispensable for global DNA methylation in embryogenesis. In contrast, EHMT2 regulates DNA methylation at specific sequences that include CpG-rich promoters of germline-specific genes. These loci are bound by EHMT2 in embryonic cells, are marked by H3K9 dimethylation, and have strongly reduced DNA methylation in Ehmt2(-/-) embryos. EHMT2 also plays a role in the maintenance of germline-derived DNA methylation at one imprinted locus, the Slc38a4 gene. Finally, we show that DNA methylation is instrumental for EHMT2-mediated gene silencing in embryogenesis. Our findings identify EHMT2 as a critical factor that facilitates repressive DNA methylation at specific genomic loci during mammalian development.",14.63,1617

Moreover, its contribution to the tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of the huntingtin gene (HTT), in whichHTTexpression levels are highest in brain and testes, is currently unknown. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in HD pathogenesis and tissue-specific expression ofHTT, we utilized the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip array to measure DNA methylation in a cohort of age-matched HD and control human cortex and liver tissues. In cortex samples, we found minimal evidence of HD-associated DNA methylation at probed sites after correction for cell heterogeneity but did observe an association with the age of disease onset. In contrast, comparison of matched cortex and liver samples revealed tissue-specific DNA methylation of theHTTgene region at 38 sites (FDR < 0.05). Importantly, we identified a novel differentially methylated binding site in theHTTproximal promoter for the transcription factor CTCF. This CTCF site displayed increased occupancy in cortex, whereHTTexpression is higher, compared with the liver. Additionally, CTCF silencing reduced the activity of anHTTpromoter-reporter construct, suggesting that CTCF plays a role in regulatingHTTpromoter function. Overall, although we were unable to detect HD-associated DNA methylation alterations at queried sites, we found that DNA methylation may be correlated to the age of disease onset in cortex tissues. Moreover, our data suggest that DNA methylation may, in part, contribute to tissue-specificHTTtranscription through differential CTCF occupancy.",6.393,1948

In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of naive cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2'-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate. In contrast, accelerated protection of naive cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. In conclusion, these results show that attenuation of the 2'-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.",7.562,581

RESULTS: The MDS group had a higher ID4 gene methylation positivity rate (22.22%) and higher methylation levels (0.21 [0-3.79]) than the AA group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there were significant differences between the hypoplastic MDS and AA groups, the MDS with low blast count and the AA groups, and the MDS with normal karyotype and the AA groups. The combination of genetic and epigenetic markers was used in much more patients with MDS (62.5% [35/56]) than the use of genetic markers only (51.79% [29/56]).

Hydatidiform moles, which are associated with a high risk of developing PE, are characterized by the excessive proliferation of trophoblastic tissue.

However, the precise mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC1 is a negative regulator of the brown adipocyte thermogenic program. The Hdac1 level is lower in mouse brown fat (BAT) than white fat, is suppressed in mouse BAT during cold exposure or beta3-adrenergic stimulation, and is down-regulated during brown adipocyte differentiation. Remarkably, overexpressing Hdac1 profoundly blocks, whereas deleting Hdac1 significantly enhances, beta-adrenergic activation-induced BAT-specific gene expression in brown adipocytes. beta-Adrenergic activation in brown adipocytes results in a dissociation of HDAC1 from promoters of BAT-specific genes, including uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (Pgc1alpha), leading to increased acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), an epigenetic mark of gene activation. This is followed by dissociation of the polycomb repressive complexes, including the H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homologue (EZH2), suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and ring finger protein 2 (RNF2) from (and concomitant recruitment of H3K27 demethylase ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on chromosome X (UTX) to) Ucp1 and Pgc1alpha promoters, leading to decreased H3K27 trimethylation, a histone transcriptional repression mark. Thus, HDAC1 negatively regulates the brown adipocyte thermogenic program, and inhibiting Hdac1 promotes BAT-specific gene expression through a coordinated control of increased acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27, thereby switching the transcriptional repressive state to the active state at the promoters of Ucp1 and Pgc1alpha.

The authors observed a significant genotype effect, an environment effect, and a genotype x environment effect. In particular, global cytosine methylation levels were significantly altered after exposure to Triops predation cues, Microcystis, and sodium chloride compared with control conditions. Significant differences between the 2 genotypes were observed when animals were exposed to Triops predation cues, Microcystis, Cryptomonas, and sodium chloride. Despite the low global methylation rate under control conditions (0.49-0.52%), global cytosine methylation levels upon exposure to Triops demonstrated a 5-fold difference between the genotypes (0.21% vs 1.02%). No effects were found in response to arsenic, cadmium, fish, lead, pH of 5.5, pH of 8, temperature, hypoxia, and white fat cell disease. The authors' results point to the potential role of epigenetic effects under changing environmental conditions such as predation (i.e., Triops), diet (i.e., Cryptomonas and Microcystis), and salinity.

We compared the global DNA methylation status in 10 control subjects compared to 80 dialysis patients (N = 40 on-line hemodiafiltration, N = 40 high-flux hemodialysis) in relation to the dialysis technique and inflammation. Whole blood DNA methylation was assessed with a 5-mc DNA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay Kit. Global DNA methylation was higher in hemodialysis (HD) compared to on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) patients (0.045 vs. 0.039; P < 0.0001) and controls (0.045 vs. 0.0284; P = 0.0002 for HD; 0.039 vs. 0.0284; P = 0.0254 for on-line HDF). To study the influence of the dialysis technique on DNA methylation we divided dialysis patients according to the median value of 5-mC. DNA methylation was highest in inflamed patients on hemodialysis. The dialysis technique was the only independent predictor of global DNA methylation in dialysis patients. On-line HDF could be associated with a favorable DNA methylation profile.",3.14,489

 Society of Hypertension",2015,"The potential effects of the interactions between DNA methylation (CpG1 and CpG2-5 methylation levels) of the alpha-adducin (ADD1) gene promoter and ADD1 tagSNPs (tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms) or the environmental factors on essential hypertension (EH) risk have not been clarified. Thus, we performed an age- and gender-matched case-control study to investigate the association between ADD1 tagSNPs and EH. A total of 1020 subjects with EH and 1020 normotensive subjects were genotyped by melting temperature shift technology. Logistic regression was used to assess the associations of ADD1 tagSNPs, environmental factors and EH. The generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method was applied to explore the potential interactions. Under additive, dominant and recessive models, no significant associations were evidenced between EH and rs3755885, rs2071694, rs4963 or rs3775067 with the complete data set or the gender-stratified analysis after adjusting for triglycerides, body mass index and alcohol consumption. However, we observed a significant association between rs4961 and EH under the dominant model after Bonferroni correction when adjusting for confounding factors in the entire sample (odds ratio (OR)=0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.50-0.83, P=0.001). In GMDR, the two-factor interaction model of alcohol consumption and DNA methylation (CpG1 methylation) was the best model, with a maximum cross-validation consistency of 9/10 and testing balance accuracy of 0.63 (P=0.01). Our results indicate that the SNP rs4961 has a protective role in the development of EH. In conclusion, the interactions between alcohol consumption and DNA methylation (CpG1 methylation) of the ADD1 gene promoter have a significant role in modifying EH susceptibility.",2.658,1104

No effective therapies exist to delay the onset or arrest the progression of these diseases. One novel and promising therapeutic approach consists of targeting disease-causing proteins at the post-translational level. Here we illustrate this concept using the example of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease caused by polyglutamine expansion in the androgen receptor. Emerging evidence suggests that two key post-translational modifications of polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor, namely serine phosphorylation by protein kinase B/Akt and arginine methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases, occur at the same consensus site, are mutually exclusive, and have opposing effects on neurotoxicity. Because several proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases have canonical Akt consensus site motifs, these findings may have a broad impact in the field of neurological diseases caused by misfolded proteins.",4.696,571

Global DNA methylation of umbilical cord blood was determined. In a second step, methylation status of 96 single genes linked to T cell activation, cytokine production, inflammatory response, and stem cell transcription was evaluated in 48 newborn infants, 20 delivered by VD and 28 delivered by CS. RESULTS: Global methylation did not differ significantly between CS and VD (p=0.732). The methylation status was low (threshold: </=3%) for the majority of single genes (n=92) in both groups. FOXP3, CD7, ELA2, and IRF1 showed hypermethylation in both groups. In the CS group, ELA2 (p<0.001) and IRF1(p =0.017) showed significantly higher methylation compared to the VD group.

In order to understand the molecular mechanism of lysine methylation, it is important to identify lysine methylation sites and their methylation degrees accurately. As the traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, several computational methods have been developed for the identification of methylation sites. However, the prediction accuracy of existing computational methods is still unsatisfactory. Moreover, they are only focused on predicting whether a query lysine residue is a methylation site, without considering its methylation degrees. In this paper, a novel two-level predictor named iLM-2L is proposed to predict lysine methylation sites and their methylation degrees using composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs feature coding scheme and support vector machine algorithm. The 1st level is to identify whether a query lysine residue is a methylation site, and the 2nd level is to identify which methylation degree(s) the query lysine residue belongs to if it has been predicted as a methyllysine site in the 1st level identification. The iLM-2L achieves a promising performance with a Sensitivity of 76.46%, a Specificity of 91.90%, an Accuracy of 85.31% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 69.94% for the 1st level as well as a Precision of 84.81%, an accuracy of 79.35%, a recall of 80.83%, an Absolute_Ture of 73.89% and a Hamming_loss of 15.63% for the 2nd level in jackknife test. As illustrated by independent test, the performance of iLM-2L outperforms other existing lysine methylation site predictors significantly.

As little is known about the ratio of non-heritable changes in DNA methylation and mitotically-inherited methylation changes, dynamics and reversibility of the DNA methylation states were investigated in grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera) stressed by in vitro cultivation. It was observed that significant part of induced epigenetic changes could be repeatedly established by exposure to particular planting and stress conditions. However, once stress conditions were discontinued, many methylation changes gradually reverted and plants returned to epigenetic states similar to those of maternal plants. In fact, in the period of one to three years after in vitro cultivation it was difficult to distinguish the epigenetic states of somaclones and maternal plants. Forty percent of the observed epigenetic changes disappeared within a year subsequent to termination of stress conditions ending and these probably reflect changes caused by transient and reversible stress-responsive acclimation mechanisms. However, sixty percent of DNA methylation diversity remained after 1 year and probably represents mitotically-inherited epimutations. Sequencing of regions remaining variable between maternal and regenerant plants revealed that 29.3% of sequences corresponded to non-coding regions of grapevine genome.

 experimental and clinical research",2015,"BACKGROUND MicroRNAs (miRNA) dysregulation has been considered to be significantly related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Several studies had proved that DNA methylation is an important cause of the abnormal expression of miRNAs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the methylation status of miR-148a and its effects on the metastasis and prognosis of skin cancer, as well as the interaction with TGIF2 gene. MATERIAL AND METHODS According to the qRT-PCR analysis, the expression of miR-148a was down-regulated in tumor tissues compared with the adjacent tissues and healthy controls (P<0.05). In vitro cell metastasis assay revealed that miR-148a could inhibit cell metastasis and its down-regulation promoted metastasis. Luciferase reporter assay found that TGIF2 gene was a target gene and its expression was suppressed by miR-148a in skin cancer. RESULTS Methylation-specific PCR demonstrated that DNA methylation rate of miR-148a was higher in tumor tissues than in adjacent tissues and healthy tissues (P<0.05). miR-148a expression was proved to be epigenetically regulated after the demethylation of it by 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine treatment and qRT-PCR analysis. miR-148a methylation was significantly influenced by many clinicopathologic characteristics such as age (P=0.000), pathological differentiation (P=0.000), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.000). Besides, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed patients with miR-148a methylation lived shorter than those without that (P<0.001). Cox regression analysis manifested that miR-148a methylation (HR=0.053, 95CI%=0.005-0.548, P=0.014) could be serve as an independent prognostic marker for skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, the expression of miR-148a was regulated by DNA methylation and targeted by TGIF2. Its methylation may be a potential prognostic indicator in skin cancer.",1.433,1880

Women treated for CIN2/3 are at risk of post-treatment disease, representing either persistent (incompletely treated) or incident (early onset) lesions. Here, we evaluated CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis as potential tool for detecting recurrent high-grade CIN lesions (rCIN2/3). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multicenter prospective clinical cohort study was conducted among 364 women treated for CIN2/3. Cervical scrapes were taken prior to treatment, and six and 12months post-treatment and tested for cytology, hrHPV (plus genotype) and CADM1/MAL-methylation. When at six months either of these tests was positive, a colposcopy-directed biopsy was obtained. At 12months, all women underwent an exit-colposcopy with biopsy. In case of rCIN2/3, re-treatment was done. RESULTS: We found 28 rCIN2 (7.7%) and 14 rCIN3 (3.8%), resulting in a total recurrence rate of 11.5%. All 14 women with rCIN3 and 15/28 (54%) with rCIN2 showed hrHPV type-persistence. Of these, 9/14 (64%) rCIN3 and 8/15 (53%) rCIN2 were CADM1/MAL-methylation positive. All incident rCIN2, characterized by hrHPV genotype-switch, were CADM1/MAL-methylation negative. All three carcinomas found after re-treatment were CADM1/MAL-methylation positive. CADM1/MAL-methylation positivity at both baseline and follow-up significantly increased the risk of >/=rCIN3 (from 0.7% to 18.4%), and >/=rCIN2 (from 8.2% to 36.8%), compared to a consistently CADM1/MAL-methylation negative result (p-value: <0.001). CONCLUSION: Post-treatment monitoring by CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis identifies women with an increased risk of rCIN2/3. Our results confirm previous data indicating that CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis provides a high reassurance against cancer.",3.774,562

 Association",2015,"AIMS: Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, can influence the risk of developing kidney disease. We studied methylation profiles in genes related to mitochondrial function to assess whether differences in these epigenetic features were associated with diabetic kidney disease in people with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: A case-control association study was undertaken (n = 196 individuals with diabetic kidney disease vs. n = 246 individuals without renal disease). Participants were White and diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes before 31 years of age. Genes that encode mitochondrial proteins (n = 780) were downloaded from mitoproteome.org. DNA methylation profiles from blood-derived DNA were generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (262 samples) and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (192 samples) arrays. Beta values (beta) were calculated and quality control was conducted, including evaluating blind duplicate DNA samples. RESULTS: Fifty-four Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine probes across 51 unique genes were significantly associated (P </= 10(-8) ) with diabetic kidney disease across both the 450K and the 27K methylation arrays. A subanalysis, employing the 450K array, identified 755 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine probes in 374 genes that were significantly associated (P </= 10(-8) ) with end-stage renal disease. Forty-six of the top-ranked variants for diabetic kidney disease were also identified as being differentially methylated in individuals with end-stage renal disease. The largest change in methylation (Deltabeta = 0.2) was observed for cg03169527 in the TAMM41 gene, chromosome 3p25.2. Three genes, PMPCB, TSFM and AUH, were observed with differential methylation at multiple Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine sites each (P < 10(-12) ). CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation in genes that influence mitochondrial function are associated with kidney disease in individuals with Type 1 diabetes.",3.115,355

Here, we aimed (1) to investigate the blood-brain correspondence of DNA methylation using a within-subject design and (2) to identify changes in DNA methylation of brain-related biological pathways in schizophrenia.We obtained paired blood and temporal lobe biopsy samples simultaneously from 12 epilepsy patients during neurosurgical treatment. Using the Infinium 450K methylation array we calculated similarity of blood and brain DNA methylation for each individual separately. We applied our findings by performing gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Infinium 27K) of 111 schizophrenia patients and 122 healthy controls and included only Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites that were significantly correlated across tissues.Only 7.9% of CpG sites showed a statistically significant, large correlation between blood and brain tissue, a proportion that although small was significantly greater than predicted by chance. GSEA analysis of schizophrenia data revealed altered methylation profiles in pathways related to precursor metabolites and signaling peptides.Our findings indicate that most DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood do not reliably predict brain DNA methylation status. However, a subset of peripheral data may proxy methylation status of brain tissue. Restricting the analysis to these markers can identify meaningful epigenetic differences in schizophrenia and potentially other brain disorders.",8.45,996

METHODS: We analyzed alterations of BarH-like 2 homeobox protein (BARHL2) in GC cell lines and tissues, as well as in DNA obtained from 128 gastric washes and 30 gastric juice-derived exosomes. GC cell lines were transfected with plasmids encoding BARHL2 and subjected to proliferation, colony formation, and gene expression analyses. RESULTS: High levels of BARHL2 methylation were detected in three of seven GC cell lines; consistent with this, these cell lines expressed low levels of BARHL2. Treatment of these cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored BARHL2 expression. Levels of BARHL2 methylation in 18 normal and 14 atrophic gastritis samples were low irrespective of Helicobacter pylori infection. High levels of BARHL2 methylation were observed in gastric wash-derived DNA obtained from early GC patients before endoscopic resection (ER), but methylation was significantly lower after curative ER. Analysis using gastric juice-derived exoDNA samples revealed that BARHL2 methylation yielded an area under the curve of 0.923 with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity with respect to discriminating GC patients from non-GC controls. BARHL2 nuclear immunoreactivity was found in all normal gastric epithelial cells and in cells from patients with gastritis and adenoma. In contrast, loss of BARHL2 expression was observed in the vast majority of the GC tissues. Finally, transfection of BARHL2 into MKN7 and MKN45 cell lines significantly inhibited their proliferation and ability to form colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation analysis of BARHL2 using gastric wash-derived DNA and/or gastric juice-derived exoDNA could be useful for early detection of GC in clinical settings.",0,1399
26156501,An evaluation of statistical methods for DNA methylation microarray data analysis.,"['Li D', 'Xie Z', 'Pape ML', 'Dye T']",BMC bioinformatics,2015,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation offers an excellent example for elucidating how epigenetic information affects gene expression. beta values and M values are commonly used to quantify DNA methylation. Statistical methods applicable to DNA methylation data analysis span a number of approaches such as Wilcoxon rank sum test, t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, permutation test, empirical Bayes method, and bump hunting method. Nonetheless, selection of an optimal statistical method can be challenging when different methods generate inconsistent results from the same data set. RESULTS: We compared six statistical approaches relevant to DNA methylation microarray analysis in terms of false discovery rate control, statistical power, and stability through simulation studies and real data examples. Observable differences were noticed between beta values and M values only when methylation levels were correlated across CpG loci. For small sample size (n=3 or 6 in each group), both the empirical Bayes and bump hunting methods showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG loci were independent. Only the bump hunting method showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG sites were correlated. For medium (n=12 in each group) and large sample sizes (n=24 in each group), all methods compared had similar power, except for the permutation test whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was low. For all sample sizes, the bump hunting method had the lowest stability in terms of standard deviation of total discoveries whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was large. The apparent test power comparisons based on raw p-values from DNA methylation studies on ovarian cancer and rheumatoid arthritis provided results as consistent as those obtained in the simulation studies. Overall, these results provide guidance for optimal statistical methods selection under different scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: For DNA methylation studies with small sample size, the bump hunting method and the empirical Bayes method are recommended when DNA methylation levels across CpG loci are independent, while only the bump hunting method is recommended when DNA methylation levels are correlated across CpG loci. All methods are acceptable for medium or large sample sizes.",2.576,408

This study examined the possibilities of tert-butyl compounds (tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH)) and other alcohols serving as methyl donors for Hg photo-methylation under light irradiation. The yield of MeHg varied among the methyl donors, and it was also significantly influenced by salinity and pH. MeHg could be generated in the presence of TBH under visible light irradiation. The hydroxyl radical (OH) was found to promote MeHg production at low levels, but degrade MeHg in excess. The photo-production of MeHg was tentatively proposed via the complexation of Hg and methyl donors, the formation of an intermediate (O(Hg)C(CH3)3), and the intramolecular methyl transfer from methyl donors to Hg.

The current published assays, however, can still be improved by lowering the number of markers in the assay and by providing more accurate models to predict chronological age. From the published literature we selected 4 age-associated genes (ASPA, PDE4C, ELOVL2, and EDARADD) and determined CpG methylation levels from 206 blood samples of both deceased and living individuals (age range: 0-91 years). This data was subsequently used to compare prediction accuracy with both linear and non-linear regression models. A quadratic regression model in which the methylation levels of ELOVL2 were squared showed the highest accuracy with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) between chronological age and predicted age of 3.75 years and an adjusted R(2) of 0.95. No difference in accuracy was observed for samples obtained either from living and deceased individuals or between the 2 genders. In addition, 29 teeth from different individuals (age range: 19-70 years) were analyzed using the same set of markers resulting in a MAD of 4.86 years and an adjusted R(2) of 0.74. Cross validation of the results obtained from blood samples demonstrated the robustness and reproducibility of the assay.

The U937 cells and normal CD34(+) cells were treated with different concentration of EPZ005687 at different time points. The apoptosis rate was determined by Annexin V/PI staining. The cell proliferation and cell cycle was determined using WST-1 assay and 7-AAD assay, respectively. The activity of H3K27 methylation was detected by chemiluminescent immunoassay. The results showed that the EPZ005687 induced an obvious apoptosis of U937 cells. The apoptotic rate was 3.96% +/- 0.79%,5.74% +/- 0.73%,13.34% +/- 1.77% and 25.24% +/- 2.55% in U937 cells treated with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 micromol/L EPZ005687 for 48 hours, respectively. However, EPZ005687 had rare effect on normal bone marrow(NBM) CD34(+) cells. The apoptotic rate was 3.64% +/- 0.62%,4.28% +/- 0.99%,6.18% +/- 1.19% and 7.56% +/- 1.34% after U937 cells were treated with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 micromol/L EPZ005687 for 48 hours, respectively. EPZ005687 inhibited obviously the proliferation of U937 cells but had weak effect on the proliferation of NBMCD34(+) cells. The inhibitory effect of EPZ005687 on U937 cells was time-dependent after treated with 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 micromol/L EPZ005687 from 12 to 96 hours. EPZ005687 induced G1 phase blocking (G1%, 64.18% +/- 13.27% vs 49.43% +/- 12.54%) and decreased the percentage of cells in S phase (9.67% +/- 2.61% vs15.26% +/- 5.58%) in U937 cells. However, EPZ005687 had no effect on the cell cycle of NBMCD34(+) cells. In addition, EPZ005687 produced obviously depletion of H3K27 methylation in U937 cells (P < 0.05), but hardly had effect on the H3K27 methylation of NBMCD34(+) cells. It is concluded that the EPZ005687 inhibites proliferation, induces apoptosis and cell cycle blocking in G1 phase in leukemia cells.

Changes in the methylation status of relevant genes have been linked to the origin, perpetuation, and severity of airway diseases. The DNA methylation profile can be also modified by the action of viral and bacterial colonization. Bacteria and specially Staphylococcus aureus toxins are recognized inflammatory amplifying factors in both lower and upper airway chronic diseases. This review summarizes the existent knowledge about the role of DNA methylation changes in chronic airway diseases and the contribution of bacterial infection on this event. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation, either intrinsic or induced by allergen or infection, may be linked to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy. These changes in methylation may suppress the production of anti-inflammatory mediators and increase the survival and activation of pro-inflammatory cells, as well as modify the immune response in response to bacterial infection, increasing their survival and pathogenicity within the infected organism. SUMMARY: Understanding the intrinsic epigenetic mechanisms, as well as the effect of environment -for example, bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of airways diseases - will greatly improve the management and the diagnosis of these diseases.",3.574,1492

METHODS: Three hundred overweight/obese post-menopausal women (50-75 years) were part of a completed, 1-year randomized controlled trial, comparing independent and combined effects of a reduced-calorie weight-loss diet, and exercise program, versus control. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes collected at baseline and 12-months, and LINE-1 methylation analyzed by pyrosequencing. Mean changes between groups using generalized estimating equations and examined effects of weight-loss on LINE-1 methylation using stratified analyses (gained weight/no weight-loss [N = 84]; <5% [N = 45]; 5%-10% [N = 45]; >10% of baseline weight-loss [N = 126]) within each arm, adjusted by blood cell counts were compared. Associations between LINE-1 methylation and previously measured biomarkers, and anthropometrics were also examined. RESULTS: No significant difference in LINE-1 methylation levels was detected in any intervention group versus controls. The magnitude of weight-loss was not associated with LINE-1 methylation at 12-months. There were no associations between baseline characteristics of participants, or previously measured biomarkers, and LINE-1 methylation.

METHODS: In all, 31 patients with H. pylori infection including 13 with FHGC were enrolled in the study. The effectiveness of H. pylori eradication were confirmed by UBT, RUT and multiplex PCR (the presence of selected H. pylori strains) for biopsy samples from the antrum and corpus. Histopathological assessment was also performed. The expression of FHIT mRNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the methylation status of the FHIT promoter was assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After H. pylori eradication, the improvement of inflammation from superficial gastritis to normal mucosa (G --> N) was observed in 39% of the patients without FHGC and in 54% of those with FHGC. FHIT mRNA expression was increased in patients without FHGC after H. pylori eradication (P < 0.05), while there was no statistically significant change in gene methylation status after H. pylori eradication (P > 0.05). For the samples from those with FHGC, the FHIT mRNA expression was not significantly changed and the methylation status fluctuated evenly. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori eradication results in the improvement of gastric mucosal inflammation and histopathological non-atrophic changes. The FHIT gene expression is increased in patients without FHGC, which may contribute to the prevention of GC development.",1.959,29

Despite tremendous efforts made towards developing LOC systems for use in the clinical setting, the development of LOC systems to analyze DNA methylation, which is an emerging epigenetic marker causing the abnormal silencing of genes including tumor suppressor genes, is still challenging because of the gold standard methods involving a bisulfite conversion step. Existing bisulfite conversion-based techniques are not suitable for clinical use due to their long processing time, labor intensiveness, and the purification steps involved. Here, we present a lab-on-a-chip system for DNA methylation analysis based on bisulfite conversion (LoMA-B), which couples a sample pre-processing module for on-chip bisulfite conversion and a label-free, real-time detection module for rapid analysis of DNA methylation status using an isothermal DNA amplification/detection technique. The methylation status of the RARbeta gene in human genomic DNA extracted from MCF-7 cells was analyzed by the LoMA-B system within 80 min (except 16 h for sensor preparation) compared to conventional MS-PCR within 24 h. Furthermore, the LoMA-B system is highly sensitive and can detect as little as 1% methylated DNA in a methylated/unmethylated cell mixture. Therefore, the LoMA-B system is an efficient diagnostic tool for the simple, versatile, and quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation patterns for clinical applications.",6.115,927

The removal of Fms protecting group is achieved under the same conditions to those used for Fmoc removal. Thus the Fms group can be interchangeable with the Fmoc group in the synthesis of N-methylated peptides using standard Fmoc-based strategies. Finally, the absence of racemization during the methylation reaction and the removal of Fms group were demonstrated by synthesising a pair of diastereomeric dipeptides.",1.546,1061

METHODS: Whole blood, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell DNA from 16 female, treatment naive MS patients and 14 matched controls was profiled using the HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Genotype data were used to assess genetic homogeneity of our sample and to exclude potential SNP-induced DNA methylation measurement errors. RESULTS: As expected, significant differences between CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and whole blood DNA methylation profiles were observed, regardless of disease status. Strong evidence for hypermethylation of CD8+ T cell, but not CD4+ T cell or whole blood DNA in MS patients compared to controls was observed. Genome-wide significant individual CpG-site DNA methylation differences were not identified. Furthermore, significant differences in gene DNA methylation of 148 established MS-associated risk genes were not observed. CONCLUSION: While genome-wide significant DNA methylation differences were not detected for individual CpG-sites, strong evidence for DNA hypermethylation of CD8+ T cells for MS patients was observed, indicating a role for DNA methylation in MS. Further, our results suggest that large DNA methylation differences for CpG-sites tested here do not contribute to MS susceptibility. In particular, large DNA methylation differences for CpG-sites within 148 established MS candidate genes tested in our study cannot explain missing heritability. Larger studies of homogenous MS patients and matched controls are warranted to further elucidate the impact of CD8+ T cell and more subtle DNA methylation changes in MS development and pathogenesis.",3.234,1168
25130464,Leucine methylation of protein phosphatase PP4C at C-terminal is critical for its cellular functions.,"['Lee J', 'Lee DH']",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2014,"BACKGROUND: Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) has been known to have critical functions in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and cell cycle by the regulation of phosphorylation of its target proteins, such as H2AX, RPA2, KAP-1, 53BP1. However, it is largely unknown how PP4 itself is regulated. METHODS: We examined the PP4C methylation on L307 at C-terminal by using methylated-leucine specific antibody. Then with PP4C L307A mutant, we explored that how nonmethylated form of PP4C affects its known cellular functions by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and DNA DSB repair assays. RESULTS: Here we show that PP4C is methylated on its C-terminal leucine residue in vivo and this methylation is important for cellular functions mediated by PP4. In the cells PP4C L307A mutant has significantly low activity of dephosphorylation against its known target proteins, and the loss of interaction between L307A PP4 mutant and regulatory subunits, R1, R2, or R3alpha/beta causes the dissociation from its target proteins. Moreover, PP4C L307A mutant loses its role in both DSB repair pathways, HR (homologous recombination) and NHEJ (non-homologous end joining), which phenocopies PP4C depletion. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the key site of PP4C methylation and establish the physiological importance of this regulation.",2.297,977

Bisulfite sequencing revealed hypomethylated state of the RNASEL promoter coinciding with methylated CpG island placed inside the gene. Several CpG sites were identified for which the methylation state was influenced by DNA polymorphism. Two of them showed monoallelic methylation. One of the CpG sites revealed functional polymorphism. A number of partially methylated CpG sites have been observed in the promoter area of RNASEL, which were used for the comparison of breed- and age-related effects. Clone bisulfite sequencing of blood leukocyte samples collected at different ages from particular individuals of AA and HC breeds and, also, BSPCR sequencing of 50 samples of juvenile and old AA and HC horses revealed increased methylation in particular CpG sites during aging.

Persistent epigenetic changes that result from environmental exposures include gains or losses of DNA methylation of cytosine, which can impact gene expression. In the present study, we compared the long-term epigenetic effects of whole body proton irradiation in the mouse hippocampus and left ventricle. We used an unbiased genome-wide DNA methylation study, involving ChIP-seq with antibodies to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) to identify DNA regions in which methylation levels have changed 22 weeks after a single exposure to proton irradiation. We used DIP-Seq to profile changes in genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation following proton irradiation. In addition, we used published RNAseq data to assess whether differentially methylated regions were linked to changes in gene expression. RESULTS: The DNA methylation data showed tissue-dependent effects of proton irradiation and revealed significant major pathway changes in response to irradiation that are related to known pathophysiologic processes. Many regions affected in the ventricle mapped to genes involved in cardiovascular function pathways, whereas many regions affected in the hippocampus mapped to genes involved in neuronal functions. In the ventricle, increases in 5hmC were associated with decreases in 5mC. We also observed spatial overlap for regions where both epigenetic marks decreased in the ventricle. In hippocampus, increases in 5hmC were most significantly correlated (spatially) with regions that had increased 5mC, suggesting that deposition of hippocampal 5mC and 5hmC may be mechanistically coupled. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate long-term changes in DNA methylation patterns following a single proton irradiation, that these changes are tissue specific, and that they map to pathways consistent with tissue specific responses to proton irradiation. Further, the results suggest novel relationships between changes in 5mC and 5hmC.",3.986,1471

Here, we aimed to identify novel NSCLC subtypes based on genome-wide methylation data, assess their relationship with smoking behaviour, age, COPD, emphysema and tumour histopathology, and identify the molecular pathways underlying each subtype. METHODS: Methylation profiling was performed on 49 pairs of tumour and adjacent lung tissue using Illumina 450 K arrays. Transcriptome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000 and validated using expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Tumour immune cell infiltration was investigated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumour methylation data revealed two subgroups characterised by a significant association between cluster membership and presence of COPD (p=0.024). Ontology analysis of genes containing differentially methylated CpGs (false discovery rate, FDR-adjusted p<0.05) revealed that immune genes were strongly enriched in COPD tumours, but not in non-COPD tumours. This COPD-specific immune signature was attributable to methylation changes in immune genes expressed either by tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells. No such differences were observed in adjacent tissue. Transcriptome profiling similarly revealed that genes involved in the immune response were differentially expressed in COPD tumours (FDR-adjusted p<0.05), an observation that was independently replicated using TCGA data. Immunohistochemistry validated these findings, revealing fewer CD4-positive T lymphocytes in tumours derived from patients with COPD. CONCLUSIONS: Lung tumours of patients with COPD differ from those of patients without COPD, with differentially methylated and expressed genes being mainly involved in the immune response.",8.29,1116

Abnormal methylation status of gene promoters of oxytonergic system has been implicated as among the etiologic factors of ASDs. We, therefore, investigated the methylation frequency of oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) promoter from peripheral blood samples of children with autistic features. Our sample includes 66 children in total (22-94 months); 27 children with ASDs according to the DSM-IV-TR and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and 39 children who do not have any autistic like symptoms as the healthy control group. We investigated the DNA methylation status of OXTR promoter by methylation specific enzymatic digestion of genomic DNA and polymerase chain reaction. A significant relationship has been found between ASDs and healthy controls for the reduction of methylation frequency of the regions MT1 and MT3 of OXTR. We could not find any association in the methylation frequency of MT2 and MT4 regions of OXTR. Although our findings indicate high frequency of OXTR promoter hypomethylation in ASDs, there is need for independent replication of the results for a bigger sample set. We expect that future studies with the inclusion of larger, more homogeneous samples will attempt to disentangle the causes of ASDs.",1.268,812

This study demonstrates that, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in innate immune signaling, is regulated by reversible arginine methylation in a range of primary and cultured cells. Under basal conditions, TRAF6 is methylated by the methyltransferase PRMT1, and this inhibits its ubiquitin ligase activity, reducing activation of toll-like receptor signaling. In response to toll-like receptor ligands, TRAF6 is demethylated by the Jumonji domain protein JMJD6. Demethylation is required for maximal activation of NF-kappaB. Loss of JMJD6 leads to reduced response, and loss of PRMT1 leads to basal pathway activation with subsequent desensitization to ligands. In human primary cells, variations in the PRMT1/JMJD6 ratio significantly correlate with TRAF6 methylation, basal activation of NF-kappaB, and magnitude of response to LPS. Reversible arginine methylation of TRAF6 by the opposing effects of PRMT1 and JMJD6 is, therefore, a novel mechanism for regulation of innate immune pathways.",0,45

 States of America",2015,"Polyploidy, or whole-genome duplication (WGD), serves as a key innovation in plant evolution and is an important genomic feature for all eukaryotes. Neopolyploids have to overcome difficulties in meiosis, genomic alterations, changes of gene expression, and epigenomic reorganization. However, the underlying mechanisms for these processes are poorly understood. One of the most interesting aspects is that genome doubling events increase the dosage of all genes. Unlike allopolyploids entangled by both hybridization and polyploidization, autopolyploids, especially artificial lines, in relatively uniform genetic background offer a model system to understand mechanisms of genome-dosage effects. To investigate DNA methylation effects in response to WGD rather than hybridization, we produced autotetraploid rice with its diploid donor, Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. Aijiaonante, both of which were independently self-pollinated over 48 generations, and generated and compared their comprehensive transcriptomes, base pair-resolution methylomes, and siRNAomes. DNA methylation variation of transposable elements (TEs) was observed as widespread in autotetraploid rice, in which hypermethylation of class II DNA transposons was predominantly noted in CHG and CHH contexts. This was accompanied by changes of 24-nt siRNA abundance, indicating the role of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Our results showed that the increased methylation state of class II TEs may suppress the expression of neighboring genes in autotetraploid rice that has obtained double alleles, leading to no significant differences in transcriptome alterations for most genes from its diploid donor. Collectively, our findings suggest that chromosome doubling induces methylation variation in TEs that affect gene expression and may become a",9.674,579

The effect of salicylic acid (SA) on plant growth, flowering time, and fruit number is known to correlate with the level of DNA methylation, while the potential correlation between SA-induced changes in DNA methylation and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites has not been studied. Trans-resveratrol, a naturally occurring plant phenol, has been reported to exhibit a wide range of valuable biological and pharmacological properties. In this study, cell cultures of Vitis amurensis capable of producing t-resveratrol were used as a model system to study whether the SA-induced increase in t-resveratrol production is associated with changes in DNA methylation of stilbene synthase (STS) genes. T-resveratrol is synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which STS genes are the key enzymes. Treatment of V. amurensis callus cultures with SA significantly increased t-resveratrol production and the expression of certain STS genes (e.g., VaSTS2 and VaSTS10). A marked decrease in the methylation of the VaSTS2 and VaSTS10 genes in response to SA was demonstrated using bisulfite sequencing, while no considerable changes were detected in the methylation of VaSTS1, a constitutively and highly expressed STS gene. The obtained results show that SA treatment selectively reduced cytosine methylation of VaSTS genes. The data suggest that selective DNA demethylation of particular STS genes could be necessary for the activation of t-resveratrol biosynthesis in response to SA. This finding provides an insight into the mechanism of SA action and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plant cells.",3.071,1047

About 200 trauma-exposed white non-Hispanic veterans of the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (91% male) underwent clinical assessment and had blood drawn for genotyping and methylation analysis. Of all, 145 participants also had neuroimaging data available. Based on previous research, we examined DNA methylation at the cytosine-guanine locus cg13989295 as well as DNA methylation adjusted for genotype at the methylation-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7208505) in relationship to whole-brain cortical thickness, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) and depression symptoms. Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses identified three clusters in prefrontal cortex that were associated with genotype-adjusted SKA2 DNA methylation (methylation(adj)). Specifically, DNA methylation(adj) was associated with bilateral reductions of cortical thickness in frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus, and similar effects were found in the right orbitofrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with SKA2 DNA methylation(adj) and negatively correlated with cortical thickness in these regions.

In addition, we investigated the genetic contribution to epigenetic variation (methylQTL). We used linear regression to test the associations between methylation scores at 461,281 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and sunlight exposure, followed by a genome-wide association analysis (methylQTL) to test for associations between methylation at the top CpG locus and common genetic variants, assuming an additive genetic model.

We conducted a meta-analysis and a methylation and mediation analysis with the use of data from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium and the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) consortium. RESULTS: On the basis of the meta-analysis of 7 cohorts in the CHARGE consortium, higher plasma HDL cholesterol was associated with fewer C alleles at ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) rs2246293 (beta = -0.6 mg/dL, P = 0.015) and higher circulating eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (beta = 3.87 mg/dL, P = 5.62 x 10(21)). The difference in HDL cholesterol associated with higher circulating EPA was dependent on genotypes at rs2246293, and it was greater for each additional C allele (beta = 1.69 mg/dL, P = 0.006). In the GOLDN (Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network) study, higher ABCA1 promoter cg14019050 methylation was associated with more C alleles at rs2246293 (beta = 8.84%, P = 3.51 x 10(18)) and lower circulating EPA (beta = -1.46%, P = 0.009), and the mean difference in methylation of cg14019050 that was associated with higher EPA was smaller with each additional C allele of rs2246293 (beta = -2.83%, P = 0.007). Higher ABCA1 cg14019050 methylation was correlated with lower ABCA1 expression (r = -0.61, P = 0.009) in the ENCODE consortium and lower plasma HDL cholesterol in the GOLDN study (r = -0.12, P = 0.0002). An additional mediation analysis was meta-analyzed across the GOLDN study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Compared with the model without the adjustment of cg14019050 methylation, the model with such adjustment provided smaller estimates of the mean plasma HDL cholesterol concentration in association with both the rs2246293 C allele and EPA and a smaller difference by rs2246293 genotypes in the EPA-associated HDL cholesterol. However, the differences between 2 nested models were NS (P > 0.05).

Previous studies have shown that DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), could enhance the development of cloned embryos, thus, the genes regulating DNA methylation reprogramming should appropriately express in these embryos. To examine whether there is a correlation between embryo development and the expression patterns of DNA methylation reprogramming related genes, we investigated the developmental progress and transcription levels of candidate genes containing DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a), ten eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases (Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3) and base excision repair related genes including activation induced deamination (Aid), thymine DNA glycosylase (Tdg) and AP endonuclease 1 (Apex1) in porcine early embryos. In this study, our results demonstrated that compared with in vitro fertilized embryos, delayed and reduced development and downregulated transcripts of DNA methylation reprogramming related genes after the 4-cell stage were observed in cloned embryos, showing the significantly (P < 0.05) lower proportions of embryos at the 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages (19.69% vs 32.64% at 72 h, 16.67% vs 25.49% at 120 h and 19.82% vs 26.29% at 156 h, respectively) and transcription levels of Dnmt3a, Tet1, Tet2, Tet3, Aid, Tdg and Apex1. When cloned embryos were treated with 5-aza-dC, the developmental progress and transcription levels of DNA methylation reprogramming related genes were improved, more similar to those detected in fertilized counterparts. Furthermore, we found that the transcripts of zygotic genome activation and blastocyst quality related genes were also effectively promoted in porcine cloned embryos after 5-aza-dC treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the disturbed transcripts of DNA methylation reprogramming related genes were observed in porcine cloned embryos, while the enhanced development of porcine cloned embryos induced by 5-aza-dC was accompanied with the improved expression of DNA methylation reprogramming related genes after the 4-cell stage, providing a positive correlation between the expression patterns of DNA methylation reprogramming related genes and the developmental competence of porcine cloned embryos after zygotic genome activation.",0.733,394

We measured urinary concentrations of iAs, monomethylarsonic (MMA), and dimethylarsinic (DMA) acids, and calculated the primary (PMI: MMA/iAs) and secondary (SMI: DMA/MMA) methylation capacity indexes in 591 children 6-8 years in Torreon, Mexico. We determined iAs, MMA, and DMA by hydride generation cryotrapping AAS. Lineal regression models estimated associations between methylation capacity and total As (TAs) or iAs. Interactions with sex were tested at p<0.10. Boys had significantly higher TAs levels, (58.4microg/L) than girls (46.2microg/L). We observed negative associations between TAs and PMI (beta=-0.039; p<0.18) and SMI (beta=-0.08; p=0.002) with significant sex differences; PMI reduction was significant in boys (beta=-0.09; p=0.02) but not in girls (beta=0.021; p=0.63), p for interaction=0.06. In contrast, SMI reduction was significantly more pronounced in girls. Furthermore, negative associations PMI (beta=-0.19; p<0.001) and SMI (beta=-0.35; p<0.001) were a function of urinary iAs levels, independently of TAs; however, the reduction in PMI was more pronounced in boys (beta=-0.24; p<0.001; girls beta=-0.15; p<0.001), p for interaction=0.04. A significant negative association was observed between SMI and iAs levels without significant sex differences. TAs and iAs associations with metabolite percentages were in good agreement with those observed with methylation indexes. Our results suggest that iAs plays an important role in reducing As methylation ability and that significant sex differences are present in As metabolism. These differences merit further investigation to confirm our findings and their potential implications for arsenic toxicity in children.",4.373,1524
26979619,Changes in gene methylation patterns in neonatal murine hearts: Implications for the regenerative potential.,"['Gornikiewicz B', 'Ronowicz A', 'Krzeminski M', 'Sachadyn P']",BMC genomics,2016,"BACKGROUND: The neonatal murine heart is able to regenerate after severe injury; this capacity however, quickly diminishes and it is lost within the first week of life. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism which plays a crucial role in development and gene expression regulation. Under investigation here are the changes in DNA methylation and gene expression patterns which accompany the loss of regenerative potential. RESULTS: The MeDIP-chip (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation microarray) approach was used in order to compare global DNA methylation profiles in whole murine hearts at day 1, 7, 14 and 56 complemented with microarray transcriptome profiling. We found that the methylome transition from day 1 to day 7 is characterized by the excess of genomic regions which gain over those that lose DNA methylation. A number of these changes were retained until adulthood. The promoter genomic regions exhibiting increased DNA methylation at day 7 as compared to day 1 are significantly enriched in the genes critical for heart maturation and muscle development. Also, the promoter genomic regions showing an increase in DNA methylation at day 7 relative to day 1 are significantly enriched with a number of transcription factors binding motifs including those of Mfsd6l, Mef2c, Meis3, Tead4, and Runx1. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the extensive alterations in DNA methylation patterns along the development of neonatal murine hearts are likely to contribute to the decline of regenerative capabilities observed shortly after birth. This conclusion is supported by the evidence that an increase in DNA methylation in the neonatal murine heart from day 1 to day 7 occurs in the promoter regions of genes playing important roles in cardiovascular system development.",3.986,1487

As one epigenetic regulation mechanism, DNA methylation of the whole genome and specific gene(s) plays critical roles in pathogenesis, progression, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer. The E-Cadherin gene is involved in cell metabolism and has been suggested to be related with malignancy of multiple tumors. This study investigated the correlation between E-Cadherin methylation and malignancy of prostate cancer. Gradient concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR (5, 10, and 20 mM) were used to treat the prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP), and mRNA level of E-Cadherin was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 82 prostate cancer patients were recruited to detect the methylation status of the promoter region of the E-Cadherin gene by pyrophosphate sequencing. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to determine mRNA levels of E-Cadherin. Methylation and mRNA levels of E-Cadherin were analyzed by the SPSS software. With elevated concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR, mRNA levels of E-Cadherin gradually increased. DNA methylation levels of tumor tissues were significantly elevated with increased Gleason score (P < 0.05) and tumor-node-metastasis stage (P < 0.05) but were not related to age, smoking habits, or alcohol consumption (P > 0.05). DNA methylation level was negatively correlated with mRNA expression of the E-Cadherin gene. Methylation in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in tumor adjacent tissues (P < 0.05). DNA methylation level of the E-Cadherin gene could be an important predictive index for malignancy of prostate cancer.",0.775,898

Although this modification is seen in different sequence contexts, the most frequently detected DNA methylation in mammals involves cytosine-guanine dinucleotides. Pathological alterations in DNA methylation patterns are described in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Unlike genetic changes, DNA methylation is heavily influenced by subtle modifications in the cellular microenvironment. In all cancers, aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the alteration of a large number of oncological pathways with relevant theranostic utility. Several technologies for DNA methylation mapping have been developed recently and successfully applied in cancer studies. The scope of these technologies varies from assessing a single cytosine-guanine locus to genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in the context of clinical utility for the molecular diagnosis of human cancers.",3.516,383

We analyzed PET scans of patients with high-grade gliomas to determine whether the MGMT methylation status affects the tumor metabolic characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with high-grade glioma, who were initially examined with 11C-methionine (MET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, were retrospectively enrolled. MET and FDG PET images were coregistered to each other and quantitative uptake of MET or FDG was assessed using tumor-to-normal uptake ratio of the cortex (TNR). TNRs for MET and FDG PET were compared between the two groups classified by MGMT promoter methylation status. RESULTS: Maximum TNR(FDG) of the MGMT methylated group was significantly higher than that of the MGMT unmethylated group (1.80+/-0.90 vs. 1.29+/-0.19; P=0.02). The MGMT methylated group also showed a trend for increased mean TNRFDG compared with the unmethylated group (0.85+/-0.21 vs. 0.72+/-0.11; P=0.10). There was no significant difference in TNR(MET) between the groups. In subgroup analyses with WHO grade 3 and 4, a trend for higher maximum TNR(FDG) was found in the MGMT methylated group compared with the unmethylated group. CONCLUSION: The MGMT methylated group showed higher glucose metabolism compared with the unmethylated group, whereas MET uptake did not show a significant difference. This suggests that MGMT methylation in high-grade gliomas could affect the tumor glucose metabolism. Thus, MGMT methylation status can cause a discrepancy in the prognostic prediction of high-grade gliomas by FDG PET, especially in patients scheduled for DNA alkylating chemotherapeutics.",1.669,1877

DNA methylation is one of the most common epigenetic modifications that control gene expression. DNA methylation may occur in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), drug transporters and drug targets, and can thereby alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in pharmacoepigenetics with a focus on DNA methylation. METHODS: The literature search focusing on DNA methylation of drug-response-related genes and DNA methylation-related SNPs in pharmacogenomics was carried out using the PUBMED database and a combination of keywords including DNA methylation, drug response, DMEs, drug transporters, drug target and SNPs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An extensive range of research has contributed to our understanding of how DNA methylation of drug-response-related genes alters their function. This is particularly well studied in cancer chemotherapy and drug resistance. The impact of polymorphisms of miRNAs in these processes requires further study. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: DNA methylation-related genetic variation is an increasingly recognized mechanism for altered drug-response and disease susceptibility. These new discoveries require assimilation into the practice of personalized medicine.",1.668,948

Aberrant TSG methylation was considered an important epigenetic silencing mechanism in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, some studies have reported differences in the methylation frequencies of P16INK4a promoter between cancer and the corresponding control group. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to better identify the association. METHODS: PubMed, Ovid, ISI Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched to identify eligible studies to evaluate the association of p16INK4a promoter methylation and HNSCC. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to evaluate the strength of association between p16INK4a promoter methylation and HNSCC. RESULTS: A total of twenty-one studies with 1155 cases and 1017 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The frequencies of p16INK4a promoter methylation in the cancer group were significantly higher than those in the control group (cancer group: median: 46.67%, range = 7.84%-95.12%; control group: median: 18.37%, range = 0-83.33%; respectively). The pooled odds ratio was 3.37 (95%CI = 2.32-4.90) in the cancer group versus the corresponding control group under the random-effects model.

Previous biochemical and computational analyses of the C/D box snoRNAs have identified and mapped a large number of 2'-OH ribose methylations in rRNAs. In the present study, we systematically analyzed ribose methylations of 18S rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using mung bean nuclease protection assay and RP-HPLC. Unexpectedly, we identified a hitherto unknown ribose methylation at position G562 in the helix 18 of 5' central domain of yeast 18S rRNA. Furthermore, we identified snR40 as being responsible to guide snoRNP complex to catalyze G562 ribose methylation, which makes it only second snoRNA known so far to target three ribose methylation sites: Gm562, Gm1271 in 18S rRNA, and Um898 in 25S rRNA. Our sequence and mutational analysis of snR40 revealed that snR40 uses the same D' box and methylation guide sequence for both Gm562 and Gm1271 methylation. With the identification of Gm562 and its corresponding snoRNA, complete set of ribose methylations of 18S rRNA and their corresponding snoRNAs have finally been established opening great prospects to understand the physiological function of these modifications.",9.112,178

Some studies are also starting to use saliva DNA as it is usually more readily available in large epidemiologic studies. However, little is known about the correlation of methylation between WBC and saliva DNA. We examined DNA methylation in three repetitive elements, Sat2, Alu, and LINE-1, and in four CpG sites, including AHRR (cg23576855, cg05575921), cg05951221 at 2q37.1, and cg11924019 at CYP1A1, in 57 girls aged 6-15 years with blood and saliva collected on the same day. We measured all DNA methylation markers by bisulfite-pyrosequencing, except for Sat2 and Alu, which were measured by the MethyLight assay. Methylation levels measured in saliva DNA were lower than those in WBC DNA, with differences ranging from 2.8% for Alu to 14.1% for cg05575921. Methylation levels for the three repetitive elements measured in saliva DNA were all positively correlated with those in WBC DNA. However, there was a wide range in the Spearman correlations, with the smallest correlation found for Alu (0.24) and the strongest correlation found for LINE-1 (0.73). Spearman correlations for cg05575921, cg05951221, and cg11924019 were 0.33, 0.42, and 0.79, respectively. If these findings are replicated in larger studies, they suggest that, for selected methylation markers (e.g., LINE-1), methylation levels may be highly correlated between blood and saliva, while for others methylation markers, the levels may be more tissue specific. Thus, in studies that differ by DNA source, each interrogated site should be separately examined in order to evaluate the correlation in DNA methylation levels across DNA sources.",4.78,1841

We investigated the DNA methylation signature of double negative T cells to gain insight into the epigenetic architecture of peripheral blood primary human double negative T cells compared to autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We identified 2984 CG sites across the genome with unique loss of DNA methylation in double negative T cells, and showed significant reduction in mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNA methylation was increased in CD8A/CD8B and CD4 consistent with epigenetic repression of both the CD8 and CD4 genetic loci in double negative T cells. We show a consistent increase in non-CG methylation in double negative T cells, a finding suggestive of pluripotency. Network analyses indicate a strong relationship between double negative T cells and functions related to cell-cell interaction, cell adhesion, and cell activation pathways. Our data also suggest a robust pro-inflammatory epigenetic signature in double negative T cells, consistent with a transcriptional permissiveness in key inflammatory cytokines including IFNgamma, IL-17F, IL-12B, IL-5, IL-18, TNFSF11 (RANKL), and TNFSF13B (BLYS or BAFF).

Phosphorylation of Ser143 (pSer143) stabilizes DNMT1 during DNA replication. Here, we show 14-3-3 is a reader protein of DNMT1pSer143. In mammalian cells 14-3-3 colocalizes and binds DNMT1pSer143 post-DNA replication. The level of DNMT1pSer143 increased with overexpression of 14-3-3 and decreased by its depletion. Binding of 14-3-3 proteins with DNMT1pSer143 resulted in inhibition of DNA methylation activity in vitro. In addition, overexpression of 14-3-3 in NIH3T3 cells led to decrease in DNMT1 specific activity resulting in hypomethylation of the genome that was rescued by transfection of DNMT1. Genes representing cell migration, mobility, proliferation and focal adhesion pathway were hypomethylated and overexpressed. Furthermore, overexpression of 14-3-3 also resulted in enhanced cell invasion. Analysis of TCGA breast cancer patient data showed significant correlation for DNA hypomethylation and reduced patient survival with increased 14-3-3 expressions. Therefore, we suggest that 14-3-3 is a crucial reader of DNMT1pSer143 that regulates DNA methylation and altered gene expression that contributes to cell invasion.",9.112,1625

Identification of differentially methylated patterns between case and control groups is important in understanding the mechanism and possible functionality of complex diseases. We propose a method to find possible functionally methylated regions which not only are differentially methylated but also have an effect on gene expression. It integrates methylation and gene expression data and is based on distance discriminant analysis (DDA). In the procedure of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we do not need to cluster methylation sites or partition the genome in advance. Therefore, the identified DMRs have a larger coverage than those of bump hunting and Ong's methods. Furthermore, through incorporating gene expression data as a complementary source, whether these DMRs are functional is determined through estimating the difference of the corresponding genes. Through a comparison of our approach with bump hunting and Ong's methods for simulation data, it is shown that our method is more powerful in identifying DMRs which have a larger distance in the genome, or only consist of a few sites and have higher sensitivity and specificity. Also, our method is more robust to heterogeneity of data. Applied to different real datasets, we find that most of the functional DMRs are hyper-methylated and located at CpG rich regions (e.g. islands, TSS200 and TSS1500), consistent with the fact that the methylation levels of CpG islands are higher in tumors than normal. Through comparing and analyzing the results of different datasets, we find that the change of methylation in some regions may be related to diseases through changing expression of the corresponding genes, and show the effectiveness of our method.",3.21,1192

METHOD: Five major blood cell subpopulations: T, B and NK cells, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, were isolated from 19 early RA patients and 17 healthy controls. Patient samples were taken before and 1 month after the start of treatment with methotrexate (MTX). Analysis included DNA methylation with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoring (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS-SRM) and expression levels of seven methylation-specific enzymes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)-naive early RA patients showed global DNA hypomethylation in T cells and monocytes, together with a lower expression of DNA methyltrasnferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, which was also decreased in B cells. Furthermore, significantly increased expression of ten-eleven translocation1 (TET1), TET2 and TET3, enzymes involved in demethylation, was found in monocytes and of TET2 in T cells. There was also modest decreased expression of DNMT3A in B cells and of growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45A (GADD45A) in T and B cells. Treatment with MTX reverted hypomethylation in T cells and monocytes, which were no longer different from controls, and increased global methylation in B cells. In addition, DNMT1 and DNMT3A showed a trend to reversion of their decreased expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm global DNA hypomethylation in patients with RA with specificity for some blood cell subpopulations and their reversal with methotrexate treatment.

We report structural evidence showing that in WRAD, a concave surface of the Ash2L SPIa and ryanodine receptor (SPRY) domain binds to a cluster of acidic residues, referred to as the D/E box, in RbBP5. Mutational analysis shows that residues forming the Ash2L/RbBP5 interface are important for heterodimer formation, stimulation of MLL1 catalytic activity, and erythroid cell terminal differentiation. We also demonstrate that a phosphorylation switch on RbBP5 stimulates WRAD complex formation and significantly increases KMT2 (lysine [K] methyltransferase 2) enzyme methylation rates.

The methylation occurs in rapid fashion (1 h) and can be conveniently carried out at ambient temperature, thus providing a safer alternative to the universally employed diazomethane-based methylation protocols. Optimization of the methylation parameters led us to conclude that methylene chloride was the ideal solvent to carry out the derivatization, and that even though methylated products can be observed surfacing after only 1 h, additional time was not found to be detrimental but beneficial to the process particularly when dealing with analytes at low concentrations ( approximately 10 mug mL(-1)). Due to its insolubility in methylene chloride, TMO.BF4 conveniently settles to the bottom during the reaction and does not produce additional interfering by-products that may further complicate the GC-MS analysis. The method was demonstrated to successfully methylate a variety of Schedule 2 phosphonic acids, including their half esters, resulting in derivatives that were readily detected and identified using the instrument's spectral library. Most importantly, the method was shown to simultaneously methylate a mixture of the organophosphorus-based nerve agent hydrolysis products: pinacolyl methylphosphonate (PMPA), cyclohexyl methylphosphonate (CyMPA) and ethyl methylphosphonate (EMPA) (at a 10 mug mL(-1) concentration each) in a fatty acid ester-rich organic matrix (OPCW-PT-O3) featured in the 38th Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Proficiency Test.

The two CD4+ lymphocytes measures were at study baseline and proximate to death. Brain tissue came from frozen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. RESULTS: Global methylation features were conserved across tissue. At individual CpG sites, methylation level was concordant between the two CD4+ lymphocytes but more diffuse between CD4+ lymphocytes and brain. Previous associations of brain methylation with neuritic plaques at target methylation sites were not replicated in CD4+ lymphocytes. DISCUSSION: There is no strong evidence of change in CD4+ lymphocytes methylation among older persons over an average of 7.5 years.

The aim of this study was to investigate a potential link between H. pylori related PCGI methylation and telomere length shortening in the human gastric mucosa. METHODS: Telomere length was measured in non-neoplastic gastric mucosa from 106 cancer-free subjects. To identify H. pylori related PCGI methylation, bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to quantify the methylation of 49 PCGIs from 47 genes and LINE1 repetitive elementResults: We identified five PCGIs (IGF2, SLC16A12, SOX11, P2RX7 and MYOD1), which the methylation is closely associated with H. pylori infection. Hypermethylation of all these PCGIs was associated with development of pathological state from normal to mild, active, and atrophic gastritis (P<0.001) and lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P<0.05), an indicator for gastric mucosal atrophy. Telomere shortening was significantly associated with mean Z score methylation of five PCGIs (R=-0.39, P<0.0001) and four of these locus (IGF2: R=-0.35, P=0.0003, SLC16A12: R=-0.35, P=0.0002, P2RX7: R=-0.29, P=0.003, and MYOD1: R=-0.33, P=0.0005). Multivariate analysis revealed that telomere shortening held an increased risk for hypermethylation (odds ratio: 1.71, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-2.63, P=0.016). CONCLUSION: Potential link between H. pylori related PCGI methylation and telomere shortening emphasize the importance of genotoxic-epigenetic interaction in the pathological state of H. pylori infected gastric mucosa.",6.359,637

Abnormal DNA methylation plays a key role in the process of some disease. However, little was known about the effect of pesticides on DNA methylation in the common carp. In this study, we investigated the mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and methyl-CpG-binding protein DNA-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) as well as the DNA methylation levels in the liver, kidney and gill of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) after 40-d exposure to atrazine (ATR) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) alone or in combination, and a 40-d recovery period. Juvenile common carp were exposed to various concentrations of ATR (at concentrations of 4.28, 42.8 and 428mug/L), CPF (1.16, 11.6 and 116mug/L), and an ATR/CPF mixture (at concentrations of 1.13, 11.3 and 113mug/L). The results revealed that the levels of genomic DNA methylation decreased in all tissues after 40d of exposure to ATR and CPF either individually or in combination. Moreover, the mRNA expression of DNMTs was down-regulated in all treatment groups. In contrast, the mRNA expression of MBD2 was up-regulated. These results demonstrated that long-term exposure to ATR, CPF and ATR/CPF mixtures could disrupt genomic DNA. It might imply that DNA methylation is involved in the toxicity caused by ATR and CPF in the common carp.",2.762,1699

The analysis of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation adds prognostic and predictive information. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to detect confounding factors that limit the number of conclusive MGMT promoter methylation results. METHODS: We analyzed 71 consecutive GBM patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy on whom MGMT analysis was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Specimens were correlated to imaging by coregistration and prospective documentation of biopsy localization. Our findings were validated in an additional 62 GBM stereotactic biopsies. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that the best MGMT promoter methylation results were obtained from samples (n = 71) taken in a tangential manner from tumor areas showing contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging. In the additional validation series of 62 stereotactically biopsied GBM, we were able to increase the rate of conclusive MGMT promoter methylation results from 76.1 to 85.48% by strictly planning the route of biopsy in a tangential manner if possible. CONCLUSIONS: These results underline that within the contrast-enhanced tumor part, choosing the trajectory in a tangential manner increases the diagnostic yield for conclusive MGMT promoter methylation analyses in stereotactic biopsies as a basis for patient stratification and individualized therapy.",2.019,1682

Although genome-wide analysis has contributed greatly to our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE, there is increasing evidence for a role of epigenetics. Indeed, recent data have demonstrated that in patients with SLE, there are striking alterations of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and deregulated microRNA expression, the sum of which contribute to over-expression of select autoimmune-related genes and loss of tolerance. To address this issue at the level of clinical phenotype, we performed DNA methylation, mRNA and microRNA expression screening using high-throughput sequencing of purified CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE, compared to age and sex matched controls. In particular, we studied 42 patients with SLE and divided this group into three clinical phenotypes: a) the presence of skin lesions without signs of systemic pathology; b) skin lesions but also chronic renal pathology; and c) skin lesions, chronic renal pathology and polyarticular disease. Interestingly, and as expected, sequencing data revealed changes in DNA methylation in SLE compared to controls. However, and more importantly, although there were common methylation changes found in all groups of SLE compared to controls, there was specific DNA methylation changes that correlated with clinical phenotype. These included changes in the novel key target genes NLRP2, CD300LB and S1PR3, as well as changes in the critical pathways, including the adherens junction and leukocyte transendothelial migration. We also noted that a significant proportion of genes undergoing DNA methylation changes were inversely correlated with gene expression and that miRNA screening revealed the existence of subsets with changes in expression. Integrated analysis of this data highlights specific sets of miRNAs controlled by DNA methylation, and genes that are altered by methylation and targeted by miRNAs. In conclusion, our findings suggest select epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to clinical phenotypes and further shed light on a new venue for basic SLE research.",8.41,1110

We identify a novel interplay between protein modifications in regulating KLF4 function. Here we show that arginine methylation of KLF4 by PRMT5 inhibits KLF4 ubiquitylation by VHL and thereby reduces KLF4 turnover, resulting in the elevation of KLF4 protein levels concomitant with increased transcription of KLF4-dependent p21 and reduced expression of KLF4-repressed Bax. Structure-based modelling and simulations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of KLF4 recognition and catalysis by PRMT5. Following genotoxic stress, disruption of PRMT5-mediated KLF4 methylation leads to abrogation of KLF4 accumulation, which, in turn, attenuates cell cycle arrest. Mutating KLF4 methylation sites suppresses breast tumour initiation and progression, and immunohistochemical stain shows increased levels of both KLF4 and PRMT5 in breast cancer tissues. Taken together, our results point to a critical role for aberrant KLF4 regulation by PRMT5 in genome stability and breast carcinogenesis.",11.47,363

Changes in the epigenome, and in DNA methylation in particular, have been implicated in each of these processes, in either the kidney or other organ systems. This review provides a primer for DNA methylation analyses and a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of current studies, but it is also a perspective for future DNA methylation research in kidney transplantation. We present exciting prospects for leveraging DNA methylation analyses as a tool in kidney biology research, and as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for predicting allograft quality and success. Topics discussed include DNA methylation changes in aging and in response to hypoxia and oxidative stress upon ischemia-reperfusion injury. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that DNA methylation contributes to organ fibrosis and that systemic DNA methylation alterations correlate with the rate of kidney function decline in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure. Monitoring or targeting the epigenome could therefore reveal novel therapeutic approaches in transplantation and open up paths to biomarker discovery and targeted therapy.",1.204,1849

We investigated the involvement of FZD3 in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms associated with human NTDs, especially spina bifida. We explored the effects of variants spanning the FZD3 gene in NTDs and examined the role of aberrant methylation of the FZD3 promoter on gene expression in brain tissue in spina bifida. METHODS: Six FZD3 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using a MassARRAY system in tissue from 165 NTD fetuses and 152 controls. DNA methylation aberrations in the FZD3 promoter region were detected using a MassARRAY EpiTYPER (17 CpG units from -500 to -2400 bp from the transcription start site) in brain tissue from 77 spina bifida and 74 control fetuses. RESULTS: None of the six single nucleotide polymorphisms evaluated were significantly associated with spina bifida, but the mean methylation level was significantly higher in spina bifida samples (13.70%) compared with control samples (10.91%) (p = 0.001). In terms of specific sites, DNA methylation levels were significantly higher in the spina bifida samples at 14 of the 17 CpG units, which mostly included in R2 region. FZD3 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with methylation of the FZD3 promoter region, especially the R2 region (R = 0.970; p = 0.001) in HeLa cells. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that DNA methylation plays an important role in FZD3 gene expression regulation and may be associated with an increased risk of spina bifida.",2.089,797

How DNMT inhibition retards disease progression and how DNA methylation contributes to MDS remain unclear. We analyzed global DNA methylation in purified CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors from MDS patients undergoing multiple rounds of AZA treatment. Differential methylation between MDS phenotypes was observed primarily at developmental regulators not expressed within the hematopoietic compartment and was distinct from that observed between healthy hematopoietic cell types. After AZA treatment, we observed only limited DNA demethylation at sites that varied between patients. This suggests that a subset of the stem cell population is resistant to AZA and provides a basis for disease relapse. Using gene expression data from patient samples and an in vitro AZA treatment study, we identified differentially methylated genes that can be activated following treatment and that remain silent in the CD34+ stem cell compartment of high-risk MDS patients. Haploinsufficiency in mice of one of these genes (NR4A2) has been shown to lead to excessive HSC proliferation, and our data suggest that suppression of NR4A2 by DNA methylation may be involved in MDS progression.",5.709,1720

However, the methylation status of SOCS3 in HBV infection-related HCC and the relationship between SOCS3 methylation and the clinical outcome remain unknown. Here, we reported that in HCC tumor tissues, two regions of the CpG island (CGI) in the SOCS3 promoter were subjected to methylation analysis and only the region close to the translational start site of SOCS3 was hypermethylated. In HCC tumor tissues, SOCS3 showed an increased methylation frequency and intensity compared with that in the adjacent non-tumor tissues. Moreover, SOCS3 expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues, and this was inversely correlated with methylation. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that in patients with an hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection background, SOCS3 hypermethylation was significantly correlated with a poor clinical outcome of HCC patients. Our findings indicated that SOCS3 hypermethylation has already happened in non-tumor tissues and increased in both frequency and intensity in tumor tissues. This suggests that the methylation of SOCS3 could predict a poor prognosis in HBV infection-related HCC patients.",2.862,203

By using semisynthetic 'designer' chromatin containing H2B-Ub bearing a site-specifically installed photocrosslinker, here we report an interaction between a functional hotspot on ubiquitin and the N-terminus of histone H2A. Our biochemical studies indicate that this interaction is required for stimulation of hDot1L activity and leads to a repositioning of hDot1L on the nucleosomal surface, which likely places the active site of the enzyme proximal to H3K79. Collectively, our data converge on a possible mechanism for hDot1L stimulation in which H2B-Ub physically 'corrals' the enzyme into a productive binding orientation.",11.47,976

Quantitative pyrosequencing was used for the determination of the methylation in the promoter CpG island, including 83 CpG motifs. In this way, the methylation pattern of the 11 tumor samples with the weakest and the strongest methylation could be identified and were compared to their corresponding tumor free colon samples. Forty six percent of the weakly methylated samples showed no significant difference to their tumor free counterparts, whereas in 27% of the cases an increased or reduced methylation was detectable. For the strongly methylated tumor samples only 18% showed no significant difference to their tumor free counterparts, whereas 82% were significantly stronger methylated. In CRC, the aberrant promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes is one aspect that defines the CpG island methylator phenoptype (CIMP) and is frequently observed in a subpopulation of cases. Patients harboring a CIMP phenotype often show additional clinicopathological characteristics, the so called CIMP features. Interestingly, no CIMP features were found for the weakly methylated samples analyzed in this study but could be seen in 82% of the strongly methylated cases, indicating a possible use for DUSP9 as CIMP marker.",1.855,216

For example, DNA methylation modifies gene expression without altering the nucleotide sequence. A well-studied DNA methylation-based phenomenon is genomic imprinting (ie, genotype-independent parent-of-origin effects). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elucidate: (1) the effect of exercise on DNA methylation and (2) the role of imprinted genes in skeletal muscle gene networks (ie, gene group functional profiling analyses). DESIGN: Gene ontology (ie, gene product elucidation)/meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: 26 skeletal muscle and 86 imprinted genes were subjected to g:Profiler ontology analysis. Meta-analysis assessed exercise-associated DNA methylation change. DATA EXTRACTION: g:Profiler found four muscle gene networks with imprinted loci. Meta-analysis identified 16 articles (387 genes/1580 individuals) associated with exercise. Age, method, sample size, sex and tissue variation could elevate effect size bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: Only skeletal muscle gene networks including imprinted genes were reported. Exercise-associated effect sizes were calculated by gene. Age, method, sample size, sex and tissue variation were moderators. RESULTS: Six imprinted loci (RB1, MEG3, UBE3A, PLAGL1, SGCE, INS) were important for muscle gene networks, while meta-analysis uncovered five exercise-associated imprinted loci (KCNQ1, MEG3, GRB10, L3MBTL1, PLAGL1). DNA methylation decreased with exercise (60% of loci). Exercise-associated DNA methylation change was stronger among older people (ie, age accounted for 30% of the variation). Among older people, genes exhibiting DNA methylation decreases were part of a microRNA-regulated gene network functioning to suppress cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Imprinted genes were identified in skeletal muscle gene networks and exercise-associated DNA methylation change. Exercise-associated DNA methylation modification could rewind the 'epigenetic clock' as we age. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42014009800.",5.025,1927

Genetics,2015,"Discriminating individuals within a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins using genetic markers remains unresolved. This inability causes problems in criminal or paternity cases involving MZ twins as suspects or alleged fathers. Our previous study showed DNA methylation differences in interspersed repeat sequences such as Alu and LINE-1 within pairs of newborn MZ twins. To further evaluate the possible value of LINE-1 DNA methylation for discriminating MZ twins, this study investigated the LINE-1 DNA methylation of a large number of twins. We collected blood samples and buccal cell samples from 119 pairs of MZ and 57 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins. Genomic DNA was extracted and LINE-1 methylation level was detected using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The mean methylation level of the three CpG sites in the blood sample among the 176 unrelated individuals was 76.60% and 70.08% in buccal samples. This difference was significant, indicating the tissue specificity of LINE-1 DNA methylation. Among 119 pairs of MZ twins, 15 pairs could be discriminated according to the difference of CpG methylation level between them, which accounted for 12.61% of total number of MZ pairs. As for DZ twins, 10 pairs had significant differences between two individuals, which accounted for 17.54% of the total 57 DZ pairs. In conclusion, there are global DNA methylation differences within some healthy concordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. LINE-1 DNA methylation might be a potential marker for helping to discriminate individuals within MZ twin pairs, and the tissue specificity must be considered in practice.",4.604,128

DNA methylation of two related cortisol response genes, the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), a nuclear receptor to which cortisol binds, and 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B2), the enzyme responsible for conversion of cortisol into inactive cortisone, independently associate with infant neurobehavior. Although these factors are part of a common cortisol regulation pathway, the combined effect of DNA methylation of these factors on infant neurobehavior has not been characterized. Therefore, we conducted an examination of the joint contribution of NR3C1 and HSD11B2 DNA methylation on infant neurobehavior. Among 372 healthy term newborns, we tested the interaction between placental NR3C1 and HSD11B2 DNA methylation in association with neurobehavior as assessed with the validated NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales. Controlling for confounders, interactions between DNA methylation of these genes were detected for distinct domains of neurobehavior (habituation, excitability, asymmetrical reflexes). Moreover, different patterns of DNA methylation across the cortisol regulation pathway associated with different neurobehavioral phenotypes. Those with low NR3C1 methylation but high HSD11B2 methylation had lower excitability scores; those with high NR3C1 methylation but low HSD11B2 methylation had more asymmetrical reflexes; those with high DNA methylation across the entire pathway had higher habituation scores. These results suggest that epigenetic alterations across the cortisol regulation pathway may contribute to different neurobehavioral phenotypes, likely though varying degrees of glucocorticoid exposure during gestation. While the postnatal environment may continue to affect neurobehavioral risk, this study provides novel insights into the molecular basis for fetal origins of mental conditions.",4.944,674

Among the five CpGs, CpG5 methylation was significantly lower in drug abusers than controls. Moreover, significant associations were found between CpG5 methylation and addictive phenotypes including tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and depression-dejection. In addition, luciferase assay showed that the DNA fragment of BDNF promoter played a key role in the regulation of gene expression.

Significant (P < 10(-4)) cytosine hyper- and hypo-methylation was found at thousands of CpG sites. Remodeling occurred outside of CpG islands. Changes affected genes with known roles in the PNS, yet methylome remodeling also involved genes that were not linked to neuroplasticity by prior evidence. Consistent with emerging models relying on genome-wide methylation and RNA-seq analysis of promoter regions and gene bodies, variation of methylation was not tightly linked with variation of gene expression. Furthermore, approximately 44% of the dynamically changed CpGs were located outside of genes. We compared their positions with the intergenic, tissue-specific differentially methylated CpGs (tDMCs) of an independent experimental set consisting of liver, spleen, L4 control DRG, and muscle. Dynamic changes affected those intergenic CpGs that were different between tissues (P < 10(-15)) and almost never the invariant portion of the methylome (those CpGs that were identical across all tissues). Our findings-obtained in mixed tissue-show that peripheral nerve injury leads to methylome remodeling in the DRG.

BDNF secretion is influenced by epigenetic (DNA promoter methylation) and genetic (val66met polymorphism) profiles. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of BDNF methylation status and val66met polymorphisms on late-life suicidal ideation. METHODS: In total, 732 Korean community residents aged 65+ years were evaluated; of 639 without suicidal ideation, 579 (90.6%) were followed up 2 years later. The prevalence and incidence of suicidal ideation were ascertained using the Geriatric Mental State Schedule. Sociodemographic and clinical covariates included age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and disability. The independent effects of BDNF methylation status on the prevalence and incidence of suicidal ideation were investigated using multivariate logistic regression models. The two-way interactions of BDNF methylation status and val66met polymorphism on suicidal ideation were assessed using the same models. RESULTS: Higher BDNF methylation status was significantly associated with both prevalence and incidence of suicidal ideation, independent of potential covariates. No significant methylation-genotype interaction was found. CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF hypothesis and the epigenetic origin of the suicidal behavior were supported, even in old age.

Compared to controls, these patients had lower GSH content, higher peroxide levels, peroxides/GSH and superoxide/GSH ratios, as well as higher methylation frequency of P15 and P16 gene promoters.

METHODS: Promoter-specific DNA methylation in whole blood was measured in 11 obese patients (presurgery BMI >35 kg/m(2), 4 females), both before and 6 months after RYGB surgery, as well as once only in a control group of 16 normal-weight men.

RESULTS: The mean genome-wide distance between promoter-specific DNA methylation of obese patients at six months after RYGB surgery and controls was shorter, as compared to that at baseline (p<0.001). Moreover, postsurgically, the DNA methylation of 51 promoters was significantly different from corresponding values that had been measured at baseline (28 upregulated and 23 downregulated, P<0.05 for all promoters, Bonferroni corrected). Among these promoters, an enrichment for genes involved in metabolic processes was found (n = 36, P<0.05). In addition, the mean DNA methylation of these 51 promoters was more similar after surgery to that of controls, than it had been at baseline (P<0.0001). When controlling for the RYGB surgery-induced drop in weight (-24% of respective baseline value) and fasting plasma glucose concentration (-16% of respective baseline value), the DNA methylation of only one out of 51 promoters (~2%) remained significantly different between the pre-and postsurgery time points. CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic modifications are proposed to play an important role in the development of and predisposition to metabolic diseases, including type II diabetes and obesity. Thus, our findings may form the basis for further investigations to unravel the molecular effects of gastric bypass surgery. CLINICAL TRIAL: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01730742.",3.234,1169

DESIGN: Case control. SETTING: Research institution. PATIENT(S): Two hundred sixty-four cases of cord blood and/or placental villi from neonates (101 IVF, 81 ICSI, 82 naturally conceived). INTERVENTION(S): Placentas were obtained at birth for biopsy and cord blood extraction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): DNA methylation and expression of imprinted genes. RESULT(S): DNA methylation at the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region (DMR) was significantly higher in IVF cord blood (48.0%) compared with controls (46.0%). No differences were found in DNA methylation between conception modes for KvDMR1 and LINE-1 in cord blood and placenta as well as PLAGL1 and PEG10 in placenta villi. PLAGL1 expression was lower in both IVF and ICSI cord blood groups than in controls (relative quantification of 0.65, 0.74, 0.89, respectively). Analyzing the expression of 3 genes in a PLAGL1 regulated IGN revealed different expression between conception modes and a significant correlation to PLAGL1 expression in only one (KCNQ1OT1). CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a stability of DNA methylation at imprinted DMRs; however, we show PLAGL1 methylation/expression to be altered after ART. As PLAGL1 expression correlated with only one of the three IGN genes in cord blood, we propose there is a more complex mechanism of regulating the IGN that may involve other genes and epigenetic modifications in this tissue. Further research investigating IGN-implicated genes in various neonatal tissues is warranted to elucidate the full effects ART-induced alterations to PLAGL1 and the IGN may have on fetal growth/development.",4.59,1133
24954181,Regulation of histone methylation by noncoding RNAs.,"['Joh RI', 'Palmieri CM', 'Hill IT', 'Motamedi M']",Biochimica et biophysica acta,2014,"Cells can adapt to their environment and develop distinct identities by rewiring their transcriptional networks to regulate the output of key biological pathways without concomitant mutations to the underlying genes. These alterations, called epigenetic changes, persist stably through mitotic or, in some instances, meiotic cell divisions. In eukaryotes, heritable changes to chromatin structure are a prominent, but not exclusive, mechanism by which epigenetic changes are mediated. These changes are initiated by sequence-specific events, which trigger a cascade of molecular interactions resulting in feedback mechanisms, alterations in chromatin structure, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and ultimately establishment of distinct transcriptional states. In recent years, advances in next generation sequencing have led to the discovery of several novel classes of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In addition to their well-established cytoplasmic roles in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, ncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of epigenetic changes via chromatin-dependent mechanisms in organisms ranging from yeast to man. They function by affecting chromatin structure, histone PTMs, and the recruitment of transcriptional activating or repressing complexes. Among histone PTMs, lysine methylation serves as the binding substrate for the recruitment of key protein complexes involved in the regulation of genome architecture, stability, and gene expression. In this review, we will outline the known mechanisms by which ncRNAs of different origins regulate histone methylation, and in doing so contribute to a variety of genome regulatory functions in eukaryotes.",4.381,1093

The mechanisms behind the association of intrauterine exposure to GDM and high risk of health problems in later life remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the alteration in methylation levels at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of GNAS and IGF2 in fetuses of GDM women and to explore the possible mechanisms linking maternal GDM with high risk of metabolic diseases in later life of GDM offspring. METHODS: Lymphocytes were isolated from umbilical cord blood of infants born to 87 women with GDM and 81 women with normal pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted and DNA methylation levels of GNAS and IGF2 DMRs were determined by Massarray quantitative methylation analysis. RESULTS: The methylation levels were detected in 7 CpG sites of GNAS DMRs and 6 sites of IGF2 DMRs. Methylation levels were significantly higher at sites 4, 5 and 7 of GNAS DMR in GDM compared to normal pregnancy (P = 0.007, 0.008 and 0.008, respectively). The methylation level at site 4 of GNAS was significantly correlated with the presence of GDM (P = 0.003), the methylation levels at site 5 and 7 were significantly correlated with the presence of GDM (P = 0.002 for both) and gestational age (P = 0.027 for both). There was no significant difference in any sites of IGF2 DMR (P > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded maternal GDM-induced hypermethylation at GNAS DMR and this condition may be among the mechanisms associating maternal GDM with increased risk of metabolic diseases in later life of offspring.",2.083,1712
26908643,The loss of imprinted DNA methylation in mouse blastocysts is inflicted to a similar extent by in vitro follicle culture and ovulation induction.,"['Saenz-de-Juano MD', 'Billooye K', 'Smitz J', 'Anckaert E']",Molecular human reproduction,2016,"STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Does in vitro follicle culture (IFC) have an effect on maintenance of imprinted DNA methylation in preimplantation mouse embryos? STUDY FINDING: We report similar alterations in the methylation pattern of H19 imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (Snrpn) and mesoderm specific transcript (Mest) imprinted genes in mouse blastocysts obtained after ovulation induction and IFC. Furthermore, we observed no differences in the gene expression of maternal effect proteins related with imprinting maintenance between superovulated in vivo grown or IFC oocytes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Assisted reproductive technology is associated with adverse post-natal outcomes such as increased risk of premature birth, altered birthweight, congenital anomalies and genomic imprinting syndromes in human and in animal models. Previous studies have shown that ovulation induction allowed normal imprinting establishment in mouse oocytes, but interfered with imprinting maintenance during preimplantation . Normal imprinting establishment was also observed in mouse oocytes derived from a standardized IFC from the early pre-antral follicle stage. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: The methylation profiles of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of three key imprinted genes (H19, Snrpn and Mest) were compared at hatched blastocyst stage between embryos obtained from IFC or superovulated oocytes, each subjected to IVF and preimplantation in vitro culture (IVC); in non-manipulated in vivo produced late blastocyst (control) and in in vivo produced 2-cell embryos that were in vitro cultured until the hatched blastocyst stage (to assess the effect of IVC). Two different mice strains (Mus musculus C57BL/6J X CBA/Ca and Mus musculus B6 (CAST7)) were used to discriminate between maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted genes. Additionally, a limiting-dilution bisulfite-sequencing technique was carried out on individual embryos in order to avoid amplification bias. To assess whether IFC and ovulation induction differentially affect the mRNA expression of imprinting maintenance genes in the oocyte, a comparison of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1o), methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) and developmental pluripotency-associated 3 (Dppa3) was performed by qPCR between in vivo and in vitro grown oocytes at the germinal vesicle and metaphase II (MII) stage. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Results showed a loss of global imprinted DNA methylation in all in vitro manipulated embryos, due to an increase in the amount of abnormal alleles (<50% methylated). Importantly, there were no differences in blastocysts obtained from IFC and ovulation induction. Moreover, similar mRNA expression levels for Dnmt1o, MBD3 and Dppa3 genes were observed in IFC and stimulated oocytes. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The methylation analysis was restricted to a number of well-selected imprinted genes. Future studies need to determine whether ovulation induction and IFC affect maternal effect factors at the protein level. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In vitro maturation of oocytes (IVM) is a patient-friendly alternative to conventional ovarian stimulation in PCOS patients. IFC is an emerging technology in human oncofertility. The results of this study show for the first time that in vitro oocyte culture induces no additional epigenetic alterations compared with conventional ovulation induction, at least for imprinted genes at the hatched blastocyst stage. The mouse IFC system can be used to test the sensitivity of the oocyte during its growth and maturation to several nutritional, metabolic and hormonal conditions possibly linked to epigenetic alterations.

In myeloid differentiation, DNA methylation changes occur predominantly in the direction towards hypomethylation. Also, in vitro differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells and macrophages is characterized by DNA demethylation. In this study, we identified the existence of methylation changes in the direction of hypermethylation among genes that become repressed during monocyte-to-dendritic cell differentiation. We identified the acquisition of DNA methylation in genes such as CSF3R, FYN, and CX3CR1, but not in others, such as CD14. Analysis of the dynamics of methylation and expression changes of these genes revealed that loss of expression was rapid and was associated with the loss of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, whereas gains of DNA methylation were progressive and partially concomitant with increases in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, with the DNA replication-independent drug nanaomycin A, revealed that there were no effects on expression and H3K4me3 changes, despite the partial impairment of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 acquisition. However, cells treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor showed lower levels of dendritic cell surface markers, suggesting a potential effect on the stability of the differentiated phenotype. Our data give rise to a novel perspective on the functional relevance and mechanisms of the acquisition of DNA methylation in myeloid cell differentiation.",0,387

In livestock, male infertility slows the improvement of animal selection programs and agricultural productivity. There is increasing evidence that epigenetic marks play an important role in the production of good-quality sperm. We therefore screened for specific or common epigenetic signatures of livestock infertility. To do so, we compared DNA methylation level in sperm DNA from fertile and infertile boars. We evaluated first the global level of sperm DNA methylation and found no difference between the two groups of boars. We then selected 42 loci of interest, most of them known to be imprinted in human or mice, and assessed the imprinting status of five of them not previously described in swine tissues: WT1, CNTN3, IMPACT, QPCT, and GRB10. DNA methylation level was then quantified in fertile and infertile boars at these 42 loci. Results from fertile boars indicated that the methylation level of the selected loci is highly conserved between pig, human, and mice, with a few exceptions, including the POU5F1 (OCT4) promoter and RTL1. Comparison between fertile and infertile boars revealed that one imprinted region, the GNAS locus, shows an increase in sperm DNA methylation in three out of eight infertile boars with low semen quality. This increase in DNA methylation is associated with an altered expression of the genes belonging to the GNAS locus, suggesting a new role for GNAS in the proper formation of functional gametes.",3.318,946

However, associations between environmental factors and DNA methylation of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) in HCC development remain ambiguous. Understanding how possible interactions influence risk may provide insights into the complexity of hepato-carcinogenesis. For this study, blood samples were collected from HCC patients (n=90) and healthy volunteers (n=99) from Xiamen (China) and data for selected environmental risk factors [e.g., benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV) infection, smoking and alcohol consumption] were recorded; factors identified as significantly higher (P<0.05) amongst case subjects compared to controls were identified. In order to assess associations for epigenetic alterations and HCC risk factors, serum DNA methylation of TSGs was quantified using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Our results clearly indicate elevated methylation patterns for detoxification gene [glutathione-S-transferase Pi (GSTP)] promoter regions in cases compared to control subjects. Additionally, GSTP promoter hypermethylation and B[a]P diol epoxide-albumin (BPDE-Alb) were positively correlated with HCC incidence. Our epidemiological and in vitro cell model studies indicated that GSTP promoter DNA methylation regulates this gene's expression. Moreover, GSTP also plays an important role in B[a]P detoxification and potential protective role against B[a]P-induced liver cell toxicity and hepato-carcinogenesis.",0,307

Although classical gene regulation has been quite extensively studied in order to understand the mechanisms behind t-PA regulation, epigenetics, including DNA methylation, still is a largely unexplored field. The aim of this study was to establish the methylation pattern in the t-PA promoter and enhancer in non-cultured compared to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and to simultaneously examine the level of t-PA gene expression. Bisulphite sequencing was used to evaluate the methylation status, and real-time RT-PCR to determine the gene expression level. While the t-PA promoter was stably unmethylated, we surprisingly observed a rapid reduction in the amount of methylation in the enhancer during cell culturing. This demethylation was in strong negative correlation with a pronounced (by a factor of approximately 25) increase in t-PA gene expression levels. In this study, we show that the methylation level in the t-PA enhancer appears to act as a previously unrecognized switch controlling t-PA expression. Our findings, which suggest that DNA methylation is quite dynamic, have implications also for the interpretation of cell culture experiments in general, as well as in a wider biological context.",3.234,1647

The HBV viral-host junctions were determined in six pairs of them with HBV infection. RESULTS: Similar DNA methylation patterns were observed among nine of ten pairs of primary and recurrent tumors. In five of six paired specimens with HBV infection, exactly same HBV DNA integrations were identified in each paired tumors.

For this reason, we proposed a fast, cost-effective method for the screening of DNA methylation based on SSCP and CE-LIF. In this study, the PCR products that were amplified from bisulfite-treated genomic DNA were denatured at 94 degrees C, followed by immediate chilling in ice water to form the ssDNA. The ssDNA were separated by 1.5% poly(ethylene oxide) (Mavg 8 000 000 Da) in the presence of EOF according to the different conformations represented by their unique methylation states. This result demonstrated that four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines represented a different heterogeneity of DNA methylation and could be distinguished by SSCP-CE. The results obtained from SSCP-CE also corresponded with those obtained from combined bisulfide restriction analysis and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting analysis. Therefore, the proposed SSCP-CE method may potentially be used for rapid screening for determination of the heterogeneity of DNA methylation in further epigenetic studies and clinical diagnosis.",3.028,1633

The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations of DNA methylation in the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2)-gene in participants with pathologic gambling behavior. RESULTS: The study was part of a large epidemiological study on pathologic gambling in Germany. DNA methylation of the DRD2-gene was analyzed from oral mucosa using next generation bisulfite sequencing. The final sample included 77 participants. The study showed significantly lower methylation levels of the DRD2-gene in abstinent patients over the last 12 or 30months compared to non-abstinent participants. Furthermore, participants without any treatment utilization regarding gambling behavior showed higher DRD2-gene methylation levels compared to treatment-seeking participants. CONCLUSIONS: DNA-methylation patterns in the DRD2-gene were altered in respect to abstinence over a 12-month or a 30-month period and to treatment utilization with higher methylation levels in non-abstinent and participants without treatment-seeking behavior. These results point towards a pathophysiologic relevance of altered DRD2-expression due to changes of DNA methylation in pathologic gambling behavior.",3.689,120

Transcription factors and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) play an important role in the regulation of gene activation under abiotic stress in plants. This work characterized AtMYB74, a member of the R2R3-MYB gene family, which is transcriptionally regulated mainly by RdDM as a response in salt stress in Arabidopsis. Bisulphite sequencing indicated that 24-nt siRNAs target a region approximately 500bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of AtMYB74, which is heavily methylated. Levels of DNA methylation in this region were significantly reduced in wild type plants under salt stress, whereas no changes were found in RdDM mutants. Northern blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that the accumulation of 24-nt siRNAs was decreased in WT plants under salt stress. Further promoter deletion analysis revealed that the siRNA target region is essential for maintaining AtMYB74 expression patterns. In addition, transgenic plants overexpressing AtMYB74 displayed hypersensitivity to NaCl during seed germination. These results suggest that changes in the levels of the five 24-nt siRNAs regulate the AtMYB74 transcription factor via RdDM in response to salt stress.",5.526,1917
25884154,DNA methylation of the LIN28 pseudogene family.,"['Davis AP', 'Benninghoff AD', 'Thomas AJ', 'Sessions BR', 'White KL']",BMC genomics,2015,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation directs the epigenetic silencing of selected regions of DNA, including the regulation of pseudogenes, and is widespread throughout the genome. Pseudogenes are decayed copies of duplicated genes that have spread throughout the genome by transposition. Pseudogenes are transcriptionally silenced by DNA methylation, but little is known about how pseudogenes are targeted for methylation or how methylation levels are maintained in different tissues. RESULTS: We employed bisulfite next generation sequencing to examine the methylation status of the LIN28 gene and four processed pseudogenes derived from LIN28. The objective was to determine whether LIN28 pseudogenes maintain the same pattern of methylation as the parental gene or acquire a methylation pattern independent of the gene of origin. In this study, we determined that the methylation status of LIN28 pseudogenes does not resemble the pattern evident for the LIN28 gene, but rather these pseudogenes appear to acquire methylation patterns independent of the parental gene. Furthermore, we observed that methylation levels of the examined pseudogenes correlate to the location of insertion within the genome. LIN28 pseudogenes inserted into gene bodies were highly methylated in all tissues examined. In contrast, pseudogenes inserted into genomic regions that are not proximal to genes were differentially methylated in various tissue types. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that Lin28 pseudogenes do not acquire patterns of tissue-specific methylation as for the parental gene, but rather are methylated in patterns specific to the local genomic environment into which they were inserted.",3.986,700

Adversity has been associated with higher methylation levels in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) in adolescents. We investigated cross-sectional and prospective associations of NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation with adolescents clinical diagnoses of internalizing disorders and internalizing symptom scores. METHODS: In a population sample (mean age=16.2) we measured DNA methylation in three regions of NR3C1 (NR3C1_1, N=454; NR3C1_2, N=904; NR3C1_3, N=412) and one region of SLC6A4 (N=939) at baseline. Internalizing problems were operationalized as clinical DSM-IV diagnoses, assessed at 3 year follow-up with a diagnostic interview, and internalizing symptom scores, assessed with Self-Report questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Only NR3C1_1 methylation was positively associated with risk of lifetime internalizing disorders, and with symptom scores at follow-up. However, after accounting for baseline symptom scores there was only a tendency for association with internalizing symptom scores at follow-up. There was no association between SLC6A4 methylation and risk of lifetime internalizing disorders. SLC6A4 methylation and internalizing symptom scores showed a tendency for association, also after accounting for baseline symptom scores. LIMITATIONS: There was no repeated measure of DNA methylation to study causality between methylation and internalizing problems. Gene expression data were not available. CONCLUSIONS: Although the role of gene methylation in the development of internalizing problems remains unclear, our findings suggest that gene methylation, particularly of NR3C1, may be involved in the development of internalizing problems in adolescence.",3.383,301

Strategies are needed which can retain high sensitivity of hrHPV testing but reduce the number of false-positives. We showed previously that a combination DNA methylation triage assay for HPV types 16, 18 and 31 and human gene EPB41L3 was useful to identify high grade cervical lesions. OBJECTIVE: Assess whether measurement of DNA methylation in HPV type 33 can improve the previous classifier. METHODS: A London colposcopy referral group of 1493 women of whom 556 (37%) had histologically-confirmed CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) 2 or 3 that included 114 HPV33 positive women with methylation measured for three L2 CpGs 5557, 5560 and 5566. Discrimination performance was assessed for the new classifier S5, built by adding HPV33 to the earlier classifier. RESULTS: HPV33 methylation measurement improved prediction among HPV33 positive women. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed an area under the curve (AUC) for HPV33 methylation of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.78). The earlier risk score was significantly improved by HPV33 methytlation (AUC = 0.82 vs 0.80; P < 0.001). For 90% sensitivity the specificity for CIN2/3 was 49% (95% CI 46-52%).

Most meQTLs influence methylation of a few CpG dinucleotides within short genomic regions (<3 kb). Here, we identified a layered genetic control of DNA methylation at numerous CpGs across a long 300 kb genomic region. This control involved a single long-range meQTL and multiple local meQTLs. The long-range meQTL explained up to 75% of variance in methylation of CpGs located over extended areas of the 300 kb region. The meQTL was identified in four samples (P = 2.8 x 10(-17), 3.1 x 10(-31), 4.0 x 10(-71) and 5.2 x 10(-199)), comprising a total of 2796 individuals. The long-range meQTL was strongly associated not only with DNA methylation but also with mRNA expression of several genes within the 300 kb region (P = 7.1 x 10(-18)-1.0 x 10(-123)). The associations of the meQTL with gene expression became attenuated when adjusted for DNA methylation (causal inference test: P = 2.4 x 10(-13)-7.1 x 10(-20)), indicating coordinated regulation of DNA methylation and gene expression. Further, the long-range meQTL was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with the most replicated locus of multiple sclerosis, a disease affecting primarily the brain white matter. In middle-aged adults free of the disease, we observed that the risk allele was associated with subtle structural properties of the brain white matter found in multiple sclerosis (P = 0.02). In summary, we identified a long-range meQTL that controls methylation and expression of several genes and may be involved in increasing brain vulnerability to multiple sclerosis.",6.393,276

25922126,Differential DNA methylation profile of key genes in malignant prostate epithelial cells transformed by inorganic arsenic or cadmium.,"['Pelch KE', 'Tokar EJ', 'Merrick BA', 'Waalkes MP']",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2015,"Previous work shows altered methylation patterns in inorganic arsenic (iAs)- or cadmium (Cd)-transformed epithelial cells. Here, the methylation status near the transcriptional start site was assessed in the normal human prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) that was malignantly transformed by 10muM Cd for 11weeks (CTPE) or 5muM iAs for 29weeks (CAsE-PE), at which time cells showed multiple markers of acquired cancer phenotype. Next generation sequencing of the transcriptome of CAsE-PE cells identified multiple dysregulated genes. Of the most highly dysregulated genes, five genes that can be relevant to the carcinogenic process (S100P, HYAL1, NTM, NES, ALDH1A1) were chosen for an in-depth analysis of the DNA methylation profile. DNA was isolated, bisulfite converted, and combined bisulfite restriction analysis was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites, which was confirmed with bisulfite sequencing. Four of the five genes showed differential methylation in transformants relative to control cells that was inversely related to altered gene expression. Increased expression of HYAL1 (>25-fold) and S100P (>40-fold) in transformants was correlated with hypomethylation near the transcriptional start site. Decreased expression of NES (>15-fold) and NTM (>1000-fold) in transformants was correlated with hypermethylation near the transcriptional start site. ALDH1A1 expression was differentially expressed in transformed cells but was not differentially methylated relative to control. In conclusion, altered gene expression observed in Cd and iAs transformed cells may result from altered DNA methylation status.",3.705,240

Here we performed simultaneous genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression analysis on purified intestinal epithelial cells derived from human fetal gut, healthy pediatric biopsies, and children newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results were validated using pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, and immunostaining. The functional impact of DNA methylation changes on gene expression was assessed by employing in-vitro assays in intestinal cell lines. DNA methylation analyses allowed identification of 214 genes for which expression is regulated via DNA methylation, i.e. regulatory differentially methylated regions (rDMRs). Pathway and functional analysis of rDMRs suggested a critical role for DNA methylation in regulating gene expression and functional development of the human intestinal epithelium. Moreover, analysis performed on intestinal epithelium of children newly diagnosed with IBD revealed alterations in DNA methylation within genomic loci, which were found to overlap significantly with those undergoing methylation changes during intestinal development. Our study provides novel insights into the physiological role of DNA methylation in regulating functional maturation of the human intestinal epithelium. Moreover, we provide data linking developmentally acquired alterations in the DNA methylation profile to changes seen in pediatric IBD.",7.374,1124

The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterizes distinct subtypes of gastric cancer (GC) and the relationship between specific methylation patterns and clinicopathological features has been evaluated. Altered DNA methylation is also observed in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa, and its potential utility for GC risk estimation has been suggested. The ability to detect small amounts of methylated DNA among tissues allows us to use DNA methylation as a molecular biomarker in GC in a variety of samples, including serum, plasma and gastric washes. The DNA methylation status of nontargeted tissue, particularly blood, has been associated with predisposition to GC. We focus on the recent development of DNA methylation-based biomarkers in GC.",4.649,775

However, the stability of inheritance and transgene expression in transgenic animals has gained extensive attention. The unstable expression of transgene through DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) targeting to the methylation of transgenic DNA such as CAG promoter and Egfp coding region in homozygous transgenic animals is still unknown. In the present study, the offspring from the same litter of homozygous transgenic mice carrying ubiquitously expressed enhanced green fluorescence protein driven by CMV early enhancer/chicken beta-actin (CAG) promoter was observed to have unstable expression of transgene Egfp, quantitative PCR, western blot and bisulfite sequencing were conducted to quantify the expressional characteristics and methylation levels in various tissues. The correlation between transgene expression and methylation was analyzed. We have found that transgene expression is dependent on the methylation of CAG promoter, but not Egfp coding region. We have also characterized the correlation between the methylation of CAG promoter and DNMT, and found that only Dnmt3b expression is correlated with the methylation of CAG promoter. In conclusion, Dnmt3b-related methylation of CAG promoter can inhibit the transgene expression and may result in the unstable expression of transgene in the offspring from the same litter of homozygous transgenic mice.",2.024,2000

To fully understand the mechanisms underlying methylation for use in drug design and work in methylation-related diseases, an initial but crucial step is to identify methylation sites. The use of high-throughput bioinformatics methods has become imperative to predict methylation sites. In this study, we developed a novel method that is based only on sequence conservation to predict protein methylation sites. Conservation difference profiles between methylated and non-methylated peptides were constructed by the information entropy (IE) in a wider neighbor interval around the methylation sites that fully incorporated all of the environmental information. Then, the distinctive neighbor residues were identified by the importance scores of information gain (IG). The most representative model was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) for Arginine and Lysine methylation, respectively. This model yielded a promising result on both the benchmark dataset and independent test set. The model was used to screen the entire human proteome, and many unknown substrates were identified. These results indicate that our method can serve as a useful supplement to elucidate the mechanism of protein methylation and facilitate hypothesis-driven experimental design and validation.",5.578,30
25916673,Age and Obesity Promote Methylation and Suppression of 5alpha-Reductase 2: Implications for Personalized Therapy of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.,"['Bechis SK', 'Otsetov AG', 'Ge R', 'Wang Z', 'Vangel MG', 'Wu CL', 'Tabatabaei S', 'Olumi AF']",The Journal of urology,2015,"PURPOSE: In men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are a main modality of treatment. More than 30% of men do not respond to the therapeutic effects of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. We have found that a third of adult prostate samples do not express 5alpha-reductase type 2 secondary to epigenetic modifications. We evaluated whether 5alpha-reductase type 2 expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens from symptomatic men was linked to methylation of the 5alpha-reductase type 2 gene promoter. We also identified associations with age, obesity, cardiac risk factors and prostate specific antigen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostate samples from men undergoing transurethral prostate resection were used. We determined 5alpha-reductase type 2 protein expression and gene promoter methylation status by common assays. Clinical variables included age, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, prostate specific antigen and prostate volume. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed followed by stepwise logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Body mass index and age significantly correlated with methylation of the 5alpha-reductase type 2 gene promoter (p <0.05) whereas prostate volume, prostate specific antigen or benign prostatic hyperplasia medication did not correlate. Methylation highly correlated with 5alpha-reductase protein expression (p <0.0001). In a predictive model increasing age and body mass index significantly predicted methylation status and protein expression (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age and body mass index correlate with increased 5alpha-reductase type 2 gene promoter methylation and decreased protein expression in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. These results highlight the interplay among age, obesity and gene regulation. Our findings suggest an individualized epigenetic signature for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, which may be important to choose appropriate personalized treatment options.",0,25

Here we report that the developmentally regulated H19 lncRNA binds to and inhibits S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), the only mammalian enzyme capable of hydrolysing S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is a potent feedback inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases that methylate diverse cellular components, including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids and neurotransmitters. We show that H19 knockdown activates SAHH, leading to increased DNMT3B-mediated methylation of an lncRNA-encoding gene Nctc1 within the Igf2-H19-Nctc1 locus. Genome-wide methylation profiling reveals methylation changes at numerous gene loci consistent with SAHH modulation by H19. Our results uncover an unanticipated regulatory circuit involving broad epigenetic alterations by a single abundantly expressed lncRNA that may underlie gene methylation dynamics of development and diseases and suggest that this mode of regulation may extend to other cellular components.",11.47,589

The methylation hypothesis suggests that folate prevents NTDs by stimulating cellular methylation reactions. Folate is central to the one-carbon metabolism that produces pyrimidines and purines for DNA synthesis and for the generation of the methyldonor S-adenosyl-methionine. This review focuses on the relation between the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation and NTDs. Studies will be discussed that investigated global or locus-specific DNA methylation differences in patients with NTDs. Folate deficiency may increase NTD risk by decreasing DNA methylation, but to date, human studies vary widely in study design in terms of analyzing different clinical subtypes of NTDs, using different methylation quantification assays and using DNA isolated from diverse types of tissues. Some studies have focused mainly on global DNA methylation differences while others have quantified specific methylation differences for imprinted genes, transposable elements and DNA repair enzymes. Findings of global DNA hypomethylation and LINE-1 hypomethylation suggest that epigenetic alterations may disrupt neural tube closure. However, current research does not support a linear relation between red blood cell folate concentration and DNA methylation. Further studies are required to better understand the interaction between folate, DNA methylation changes and NTDs.",2.903,1150

METHODS: We analyzed sample sets from blood (n = 72) and cerebral cortex (n = 24) in Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. We genotyped SNCA single-nucleotide polymorphisms, examined messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and assessed intron 1 methylation levels by methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

In addition, rs3756063 was associated with SNCA methylation level in both blood (P = 5.9 x 10(-5)) and brain (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a link between SNCA variability, promoter methylation, and Parkinson's disease risk and indicate that methylation patterns in brain are mirrored in the blood. SNCA methylation warrants further investigation as a potential biomarker.",5.68,460

Single-CpG resolution genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the Infinium assay was performed on 109 samples of non-cancerous gastric mucosa (N) and 105 samples of tumorous tissue (T). DNA methylation alterations in T samples relative to N samples were evident for 3861 probes. Since N can be at the precancerous stage according to the field cancerization concept, unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on DNA methylation levels was performed on N samples (betaN) using the 3861 probes. This divided the 109 patients into three clusters: A (n = 20), B1 (n = 20), and B2 (n = 69). Gastric carcinomas belonging to Cluster B1 showed tumor aggressiveness more frequently than those belonging to Clusters A and B2. The recurrence-free and overall survival rates of patients in Cluster B1 were lower than those of patients in Clusters A and B2. Sixty hallmark genes for which betaN characterized the epigenetic clustering were identified. We then focused on DNA methylation levels in T samples (betaT) of the 60 hallmark genes. In 48 of them, including the ADAM23, OLFM4, AMER2, GPSM1, CCL28, DTX1 and COL23A1 genes, betaT was again significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness, and the recurrence-free and/or overall survival rates. Multivariate analyses revealed that betaT was a significant prognostic factor, being independent of clinicopathological parameters. These data indicate that DNA methylation profiles at the precancerous stage may be inherited by gastric carcinomas themselves, thus determining tumor aggressiveness and patient outcome.",5.334,979

We aimed to conduct an integrated analysis with both population and in vitro studies to systematically explore the relationships among n-3 PUFA, DNA methylation, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene expression, and protein concentration of IL6. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium, we found that higher methylation of IL6 promoter cg01770232 was associated with higher IL-6 plasma concentration (p = 0.03) and greater IL6 gene expression (p = 0.0005). Higher circulating total n-3 PUFA was associated with lower cg01770232 methylation (p = 0.007) and lower IL-6 concentration (p = 0.02). Moreover, an allele of IL6 rs2961298 was associated with higher cg01770232 methylation (p = 2.55 x 10(-7) ). The association between n-3 PUFA and cg01770232 methylation was dependent on rs2961298 genotype (p = 0.02), but higher total n-3 PUFA was associated with lower cg01770232 methylation in the heterozygotes (p = 0.04) not in the homozygotes. CONCLUSION: Higher n-3 PUFA is associated with lower methylation at IL6 promoter, which may be modified by IL6 SNPs.",4.603,1090

However mechanisms underlying these relationships remain limited. METHODS: We examined whether maternal Cd levels during early pregnancy were associated with offspring DNA methylation at regulatory sequences of genomically imprinted genes and weight at birth, and whether Fe and Zn altered these associations. Cd, Fe and Zn were measured in maternal blood of 319 women </= 12 weeks gestation. Offspring umbilical cord blood leukocyte DNA methylation at regulatory differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of 8 imprinted genes was measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Regression models were used to examine the relationships among Cd, Fe, Zn, and DMR methylation and birth weight. RESULTS: Elevated maternal blood Cd levels were associated with lower birth weight (p = 0.03). Higher maternal blood Cd levels were also associated with lower offspring methylation at the PEG3 DMR in females (beta = 0.55, se = 0.17, p = 0.05), and at the MEG3 DMR in males (beta = 0.72, se = 0.3, p = 0.08), however the latter association was not statistically significant. Associations between Cd and PEG3 and PLAGL1 DNA methylation were stronger in infants born to women with low concentrations of Fe (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the association between pre-natal Cd and offspring DNA methylation at regulatory sequences of imprinted genes may be sex- and gene-specific. Essential metals such as Zn may mitigate DNA methylation response to Cd exposure. Larger studies are required.",1.842,443

Because brain tissue is not accessible in living humans, epigenetic studies are most often conducted in blood. Saliva is often collected for genotyping studies but is rarely used to examine DNA methylation because the proportion of epithelial cells and leukocytes varies extensively between individuals. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether saliva DNA is informative for studies of psychiatric disorders. DNA methylation (HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) was assessed in saliva and blood samples from 64 adult African Americans. Analyses were conducted using linear regression adjusted for appropriate covariates, including estimated cellular proportions. DNA methylation from brain tissues (cerebellum, frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus) was obtained from a publically available dataset. Saliva and blood methylation was clearly distinguishable though there was positive correlation overall. There was little correlation in CpG sites within relevant candidate genes. Correlated CpG sites were more likely to occur in areas of low CpG density (i.e., CpG shores and open seas). There was more variability in CpG sites from saliva than blood, which may reflect its heterogeneity. Finally, DNA methylation in saliva appeared more similar to patterns from each of the brain regions examined overall than methylation in blood. Thus, this study provides a framework for using DNA methylation from saliva and suggests that DNA methylation of saliva may offer distinct opportunities for epidemiological and longitudinal studies of psychiatric traits.",1.204,1219

Promoter methylation analysis and expression profile analysis of two genes were performed by methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR in cancer lesions and matched normal tissues. The promoter region of CTCF has not been hypermethylated in all patient samples. In contrast, methylation of SIRT6 gene was present in invasive cancers (93.5%) and matched normal tissues (96.8%) from 62 patients. Promoter hypermethylation of SIRT6 was also observed in ductal carcinoma in situ (three of three) and matched normal tissues (two of three). mRNA expression of CTCF and SIRT6 in invasive tumors showed a lower level than that in paired normal tissues (p=0.008 and p=0.030, respectively). The fold change values of CTCF expression were significantly lower in invasive ductal cancer lesions with Ki-67-positive status (p=0.042). In conclusion, our data showed that the methylation status of CTCF and SIRT6 promoter regions was not statistically different in cancer lesions compared with matched normal tissues.

The alteration of DNA methylation levels in gene-specific promoter regions has been investigated in some studies of human alcoholics. This study was aimed to investigate whether social alcohol consumption during periconceptional period is associated with epigenetic alteration and its generational transmission in the blood cells. METHODS: We investigated patterns of alcohol intake in a prospective cohort of 355 pairs of pregnant women and their spouses who reported alcohol intake during the periconceptional period. A subpopulation of 164 families was established for the epigenetic study based on the availability of peripheral blood and cord blood DNA. The relative methylation changes of dopamine transporter (DAT), serotonin transporter (SERT), and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene promoters were analyzed using methylation-specific endonuclease digestion followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The relative methylation level of the DAT gene promoter was decreased in the group of mothers reporting above moderate drinking (p = 0.029) and binge drinking (p = 0.037) during pregnancy. The relative methylation level of the DAT promoter was decreased in the group of fathers reporting heavy binge drinking (p = 0.003). The relative methylation levels of the SERT gene promoter were decreased in the group of newborns of light drinking mothers before pregnancy (p = 0.012) and during pregnancy (p = 0.003). The methylation level in the MeCP2 promoter region of babies whose mothers reported above moderate drinking during pregnancy was increased (p = 0.02). In addition, methylation pattern in the DAT promoter region of babies whose fathers reported heavy binge drinking was decreased (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that periconceptional alcohol intake may cause epigenetic changes in specific locus of parental and newborn genomes as follows: Alcohol consumption decreases the methylation level of the DAT promoter region of the parent themselves, maternal alcohol drinking during the periconceptional period decreases the methylation level of the SERT promoter region of newborns, and maternal alcohol consumption increases the methylation level of the MeCP2 promoter region of newborns.",3.205,659

We performed a within-subject randomized blinded study with 16 healthy subjects to examine the effect of one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the genome-wide methylation profile in blood compared with that in normal sleep. Genome-wide differences in methylation between both conditions were assessed by applying a paired regression model that corrected for monocyte subpopulations. In addition, the correlations between the methylation of genes detected to be modulated by TSD and gene expression were examined in a separate, publicly available cohort of 10 healthy male donors (E-GEOD-49065). Sleep deprivation significantly affected the DNA methylation profile both independently and in dependency of shifts in monocyte composition. Our study detected differential methylation of 269 probes. Notably, one CpG site was located 69 bp upstream of ING5, which has been shown to be differentially expressed after sleep deprivation. Gene set enrichment analysis detected the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways to be enriched among the differentially methylated genes. These results provide evidence that total acute sleep deprivation alters the methylation profile in healthy human subjects. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that systematically investigated the impact of total acute sleep deprivation on genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in blood and related the epigenomic findings to the expression data.",2.362,1035

Patients were subdivided into those receiving single-agent treatment with DTIC/TMZ (cohort S, n = 74) and those treated with combination chemotherapy including DTIC/TMZ (cohort C, n = 79). Median follow-up was 248 and 336 days for cohort S and cohort C, respectively. MGMT promoter methylation was assessed by three methods. The methylation-related transcriptional silencing of MGMT mRNA expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Response to chemotherapy and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were correlated to MGMT promoter methylation status. MGMT promoter methylation was detected in tumor biopsies from 21.5 % of the patients. MGMT mRNA was found to be significantly lower in tumors positive for MGMT promoter methylation compared to tumors without methylation in both treatment cohorts (p < 0.005). DTIC/TMZ therapy response rate was found to be significantly associated with MGMT promoter methylation in cohort S (p = 0.0005), but did not reach significance in cohort C (p = 0.16). Significantly longer PFS was observed among patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors (p = 0.002). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified presence of MGMT promoter methylation as an independent variable associated with longer PFS. Together, this implies that MGMT promoter methylation is associated with response to single-agent DTIC/TMZ and longer PFS in disseminated cutaneous melanoma.",5.085,510

Bisulfite modification and MethyLight method established by our research team were used to determine the methylation level of the two key CpG sites (at -1189 and -1176) of the promoter of CASP8AP2 gene. RESULTS: The average methylation level of the two CpG sites in newly diagnosted samples was higher than that in CR samples (71.1% +/- 1.7% vs 64.2% +/- 21.2%) (P = 0.008). Analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the area under curve was 0.687 (P = 0.024), indicating that the methylation level of the two CpG sites was able to predict relapse efficiently to some extent, 76.9% was chosed as a cutoff value to divide the patients into high methylation group (49 patients) and low methylation group (60 patients). The incidence of relapse in high methylation group was higher than that in low methylation group (20.4% vs 6.7%) (P = 0.044), five year relapse free survival in high methylation group was also lower than that in low methylation group (Log rank, P = 0.033). Furthermore, high methylation at new diagnosis were correlated with high level of minimal residual disease (MRD) before consolidation therapy (P = 0.011). In the 34 children with MRD >/= 10(-4) at the end of induction remission, the relapse rate of high methylation patients was significantly higher than that of low methylation patients (8/16 vs 3/18)(P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: The abnormal hypermethylation of the two CpG sites (at -1189 and -1176) of the promoter of the CASP8AP2 gene is possibly associated with leukemogenesis in childhood ALL. The treatment outcome is more poor in patients with hypermethylation than that in patients with low methylation. The combination of the methylation level of the two CpG sites and MRD level at the end induction remission is able to predict relapse more effectively.",0,1044

Chromatin structure and regulation provide a substrate through which genetic differences in noncoding regions may affect cellular function and response to disease, but the mechanisms are unknown. OBJECTIVE: We conducted genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in different strains of mice that are susceptible and resistant to isoproterenol-induced dysfunction to test the hypothesis that this epigenetic mark may play a causal role in the development of heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: BALB/cJ and BUB/BnJ mice, determined to be susceptible and resistant to isoproterenol-induced heart failure, respectively, were administered the drug for 3 weeks via osmotic minipump. Reduced representational bisulfite sequencing was then used to compare the differences between the cardiac DNA methylomes in the basal state between strains and then after isoproterenol treatment. Single-base resolution DNA methylation measurements were obtained and revealed a bimodal distribution of methylation in the heart, enriched in lone intergenic CpGs and depleted from CpG islands around genes. Isoproterenol induced global decreases in methylation in both strains; however, the basal methylation pattern between strains shows striking differences that may be predictive of disease progression before environmental stress. The global correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression (as measured by microarray) was modest and revealed itself only with focused analyses of transcription start site and gene body regions (in contrast to when gene methylation was examined in toto). Modules of comethylated genes displayed correlation with other protein-based epigenetic marks, supporting the hypothesis that chromatin modifications act in a combinatorial manner to specify transcriptional phenotypes in the heart. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first single-base resolution map of the mammalian cardiac DNA methylome and the first case-control analysis of the changes in DNA methylation with heart failure. The findings demonstrate marked genetic differences in DNA methylation that are associated with disease progression.",11.019,57
26710171,Dynamic Roles for Small RNAs and DNA Methylation during Ovule and Fiber Development in Allotetraploid Cotton.,"['Song Q', 'Guan X', 'Chen ZJ']",PLoS genetics,2015,"DNA methylation is essential for plant and animal development. In plants, methylation occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C or T) sites via distinct pathways. Cotton is an allotetraploid consisting of two progenitor genomes. Each cotton fiber is a rapidly-elongating cell derived from the ovule epidermis, but the molecular basis for this developmental transition is unknown. Here we analyzed methylome, transcriptome, and small RNAome and revealed distinct changes in CHH methylation during ovule and fiber development. In ovules, CHH hypermethylation in promoters correlated positively with siRNAs, inducing RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM), and up-regulation of ovule-preferred genes. In fibers, the ovule-derived cells generated additional heterochromatic CHH hypermethylation independent of RdDM, which repressed transposable elements (TEs) and nearby genes including fiber-related genes. Furthermore, CHG and CHH methylation in genic regions contributed to homoeolog expression bias in ovules and fibers. Inhibiting DNA methylation using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in cultured ovules has reduced fiber cell number and length, suggesting a potential role for DNA methylation in fiber development. Thus, RdDM-dependent methylation in promoters and RdDM-independent methylation in TEs and nearby genes could act as a double-lock feedback mechanism to mediate gene and TE expression, potentiating the transition from epidermal to fiber cells during ovule and seed development.",7.528,194

However, the relationship between methylation patterns and the heterogeneity of breast cancer has not been comprehensively characterized. METHODS: Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays was performed on 188 human breast tumors. Unsupervised bootstrap consensus clustering was performed to identify DNA methylation epigenetic subgroups (epitypes). The Cancer Genome Atlas data, including methylation profiles of 669 human breast tumors, was used for validation. The identified epitypes were characterized by integration with publicly available genome-wide data, including gene expression levels, DNA copy numbers, whole-exome sequencing data, and chromatin states. RESULTS: We identified seven breast cancer epitypes. One epitype was distinctly associated with basal-like tumors and with BRCA1 mutations, one epitype contained a subset of ERBB2-amplified tumors characterized by multiple additional amplifications and the most complex genomes, and one epitype displayed a methylation profile similar to normal epithelial cells. Luminal tumors were stratified into the remaining four epitypes, with differences in promoter hypermethylation, global hypomethylation, proliferative rates, and genomic instability. Specific hyper- and hypomethylation across the basal-like epitype was rare. However, we observed that the candidate genomic instability drivers BRCA1 and HORMAD1 displayed aberrant methylation linked to gene expression levels in some basal-like tumors. Hypomethylation in luminal tumors was associated with DNA repeats and subtelomeric regions. We observed two dominant patterns of aberrant methylation in breast cancer. One pattern, constitutively methylated in both basal-like and luminal breast cancer, was linked to genes with promoters in a Polycomb-repressed state in normal epithelial cells and displayed no correlation with gene expression levels. The second pattern correlated with gene expression levels and was associated with methylation in luminal tumors and genes with active promoters in normal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hypermethylation patterns across basal-like breast cancer may have limited influence on tumor progression and instead reflect the repressed chromatin state of the tissue of origin. On the contrary, hypermethylation patterns specific to luminal breast cancer influence gene expression, may contribute to tumor progression, and may present an actionable epigenetic alteration in a subset of luminal breast cancers.",1.585,1565

The mechanism underlying such heterogeneity is unclear. We hypothesized that FA supplementation induces changes in breast cancer-associated (BRCA) genes 1 and 2 expression and function through altered epigenetic regulation in a cell type-dependent manner. We investigated the effect of treating normal and cancer cells with physiologically relevant FA concentrations on the mRNA and protein expression, capacity for DNA repair, and DNA methylation of BRCA1 and BRCA2. FA treatment induced dose-related increases in BRCA1 mRNA expression in HepG2, Huh-7D12, Hs578T, and JURKAT and in BRCA2 in HepG2, Hs578T, MCF7, and MDA-MB-157 cells. FA did not affect the corresponding normal cells or on any of the ovarian cell lines. Folic acid induced increased BRCA1 protein expression in Hs578T, but not HepG2 cells, whereas BRCA2 protein levels were undetectable. FA treatment did not alter DNA repair in liver-derived cells, whereas there were transient effects on breast-derived cells. There was no effect of FA treatment on BRCA1 or BRCA2 DNA methylation, although there was some variation in the methylation of specific CpG loci between some cell lines. Overall, these findings show that the effects of FA on BRCA-related outcomes differ between cells lines, but the biological consequences of induced changes in BRCA expression appear to be at most limited.",1.443,1608

The methylation status of MGMT (O6 methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase) promoter is one of the strongest predictive and prognostic factors for the patient chemoresponse. For instance, the molecular method of assessment for MGMT promoter status is not standardized. In this background, we developed a fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis-based methylation specific-PCR. This technique allowed a semi-quantitative estimate of the relative ratio between methylated and unmethylated alleles. The efficacy and accuracy of the technique was assessed in a retrospective cohort of 178 newly diagnosed adult HGGs, who were homogeneously treated. First, we analyzed the impact on survival of different cut-off points in the MGMT promoter methylation and, to go further, we correlated these different rates to other well-known prognostic molecular factors involved in adult HGGs. This strategy allowed to validate our technique as a very sensitive technique (detection of a low methylation percentage, < 5%), which was feasible in fresh-frozen as well as in FFPE samples and had the propensity to detect intra-tumor heterogeneity. This technique identified a new sub-group of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas or oligoastrocytomas defined by a minor methylation and a worse outcome and, therefore, will help to substratify accurately into more homogeneous subgroups of methylated tumors.",3.522,1589

To date no objective approach for the comparison of these methods has been developed and as such it remains difficult to assess which analysis tool is most appropriate for a given experiment. As a result, there is an unmet need for a DNA methylation data simulator that can accurately reproduce a wide range of experimental setups, and can be routinely used to compare the performance of different statistical models. RESULTS: We have developed WGBSSuite, a flexible stochastic simulation tool that generates single-base resolution DNA methylation data genome-wide. Several simulator parameters can be derived directly from real datasets provided by the user in order to mimic real case scenarios. Thus, it is possible to choose the most appropriate statistical analysis tool for a given simulated design. To show the usefulness of our simulator, we also report a benchmark of commonly used methods for differential methylation analysis.

Additionally, environmental factors such as perinatal stress and early adversities contribute to the occurrence and severity of ADHD. Recently, DNA methylation has emerged as a mechanism that potentially mediates gene-environmental interaction effects in the aetiology and phenomenology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated whether serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) methylation patterns were associated with clinical characteristics and regional cortical thickness in children with ADHD. METHOD: In 102 children with ADHD (age 6-15 years), the methylation status of the SLC6A4 promoter was measured. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was obtained and ADHD symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: A higher methylation status of the SLC6A4 promoter was significantly associated with worse clinical presentations (more hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and more commission errors). Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between SLC6A4 methylation levels and cortical thickness values in the right occipito-temporal regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the SLC6A4 methylation status may be associated with certain symptoms of ADHD, such as behavioural disinhibition, and related brain changes. Future studies that use a larger sample size and a control group are required to corroborate these results.",5.938,416

Histone methylations, which are key determinants of chromatin state and transcriptional status, have been subject to particularly intense studies, but methylations on non-histone protein substrates are also abundant and biologically significant. Numerous studies have addressed lysine methylation in the realm of cancer biology. A recent study used an antibody-based approach to investigate the methylation of Lys-561 of the stress-inducible Hsp70 protein HSPA1, focusing exclusively on dimethylated HSPA1, concluding that it was elevated in cancer [Cho et al. (2012), Nat. Commun.,3, 1072]. In the present study, we have performed a more extensive analysis of HSPA1 methylation status in cancer samples, using protein mass spectrometry. We found that the four methylation states of Lys561 on HSPA1 (un-, mono-, di- and trimethylated) could be measured accurately and reproducibly in samples from carcinomas. We investigated HSPA1 methylation in 70 effusions, representing 53 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas and 17 breast carcinomas. Notably, we found the trimethylated form of HSPA1 to be predominant in the cancer samples. HSPA1 methylation was studied for association with clinicopathologic parameters, including chemotherapy response and survival. The trimethylated form was more prevalent in breast carcinoma effusions (p = 0.014), whereas the dimethylated (p = 0.025), monomethylated (p = 0.004) and unmethylated (p = 0.021) forms were overrepresented in the ovarian carcinomas. For the ovarian carcinomas, the monomethylated (p = 0.028) and unmethylated (p = 0.007) forms were significantly related to the presence of higher residual disease volume, while the unmethylated form was significantly associated with poor overall (p = 0.015) and progression-free (p = 0.012) survival. In conclusion, lysine methylation of HSPA1 differs between metastatic breast and ovarian carcinoma, and unmethylated HSPA1 shows potential as a prognostic marker in high-grade serous carcinoma.",3.234,135

Some features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy can occasionally be found in patients with PHHP, but these features are also common in Turner syndrome. The authors report on an extremely rare case of a patient with PHHP and Turner syndrome, a 47-year-old woman who sought medical attention for hypocalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone.

In this study, DNA methylation analysis was compared with cytology for triage testing in hrHPV-positive women. Moreover, feasibility of DNA methylation analysis directly on brush-based self-sampled specimens was assessed. METHODS: Non-responding women from population-based screening were invited to self-collect a cervico-vaginal specimen for hrHPV testing; hrHPV-positive women were referred to a physician for triage liquid-based cytology. DNA methylation analysis was performed on 128 hrHPV-positive physician-collected triage samples and 50 matched brush self-samples with QMSP for C13ORF18, EPB41L3, JAM3 and TERT. RESULTS: In physician-taken triage material, DNA methylation analysis of JAM3 showed the highest combined specificity (88%) and sensitivity (82%) for detection of CIN3+, whereas cytology showed a specificity of 48% and a sensitivity of 91%. Out of 39 women with abnormal cytology and normal histology (false-positive by cytology), 87% were negative for JAM3 and 90% for C13ORF18 methylation. Agreement between DNA methylation analysis performed directly on the matched self-sampled material and physician-taken samples was 88% for JAM3 (kappa=0.75, P<0.001) and 90% for C13ORF18 (kappa=0.77; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation analysis as a triage test in hrHPV-positive women is an attractive alternative to cytology. Furthermore, DNA methylation is feasible directly on brush-based self-samplers and showed good correlation with matched physician-taken samples. Direct molecular triage on self-collected specimens could optimise the screening program, especially for non-responders, as this would eliminate the need for an additional physician-taken scraping for triage testing.",4.836,1895

METHODS: The lactating mother rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12): zinc-adequate group (ZA: zinc 30 mg/kg diet), zinc-deprived group (ZD: zinc 1 mg/kg diet), and a pair-fed group (PF: zinc 30 mg/kg diet), in which the rats were pair-fed to those in the ZD group. After weaning (on day 23), offspring were fed the same diets as their mothers. After 37 days, the zinc concentrations in the plasma and hippocampus were measured, and the behavioral function of the offspring rats was measured using the passive avoidance performance test. We then assessed the DNA methylation patterns of the exon IX of BDNF by methylation-specific quantitative real-time PCR and the mRNA expression of BDNF in the hippocampus by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the ZA and PF groups, rats in the ZD group had shorter latency period, lower zinc concentrations in the plasma and hippocampus (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the DNA methylation of the BDNF exon IX was significantly increased in the ZD group, compared with the ZA and PF groups, whereas the expression of the BDNF mRNA was decreased. In addition, the DNMT1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated and DNMT3A was downregulated in the ZD group, but not in the ZA and PF groups. CONCLUSION: The learning and memory damage in offspring may be a result of the epigenetic changes of the BDNF genes in response to the zinc-deficient diet during 0 approximately 2 month period. Furthermore, this work supports the speculative notion that altered DNA methylation of BDNF in the hippocampus is one of the main causes of cognitive impairment by zinc deficiency.",2.274,1636

 and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2015,"Rhabdomyosarcoma comprises two major subtypes, fusion positive (PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1) and fusion negative. To investigate the significance of DNA methylation in these subtypes, we analyzed methylation profiles of 37 rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and 10 rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, as well as 8 normal tissues. Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation clearly distinguished the fusion-positive and fusion-negative subsets. The fusion-positive tumors showed substantially lower overall levels of methylation compared with fusion-negative tumors. Comparison with the methylation pattern of normal skeletal muscle and bone marrow indicates that fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma is more similar to these normal tissues compared with fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, and suggests that many of the methylation differences between these subtypes arise from 'aberrant' hyper- and hypomethylation events in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma. Integrative methylation and gene expression analysis revealed that methylation differences between fusion-positive and fusion-negative tumors could either be positively or negatively associated with mRNA expression. There was no significant difference in the distribution of PAX3-FOXO1-binding sites between genes with and without differential methylation. However, the finding that PAX3-FOXO1-binding sites were enriched among genes that were both differentially methylated and differentially expressed suggests that the fusion protein interacts with DNA methylation to regulate target gene expression. An 11-gene DNA methylation signature, classifying the rhabdomyosarcoma tumors into fusion-positive and fusion-negative subsets, was established and validated by pyrosequencing assays. Notably, EMILIN1 (part of the 11-gene signature) showed higher methylation and lower mRNA expression in fusion-positive compared with fusion-negative tumors, and demonstrated demethylation and re-expression in multiple fusion-positive cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that fusion-positive and fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma tumors possess characteristic methylation profiles that contribute to the expression differences between these fusion subtypes. These findings indicate an important relationship between fusion status and epigenetic changes in rhabdomyosarcoma, present a novel approach for ascertaining fusion status, and may identify new therapeutic targets in rhabdomyosarcoma.",0,318

While the diagnostic performance of the use of RASSF1A methylation as a serum or plasma marker in patients with HCC has varied largely in the literature,we confirmed the clinical application value of serum RASSF1A methylation for HBV related HCC in this study. METHODS: A total of 584 participants were recruited into this study, including 190 patients with HCC, 114 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 120 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 160 healthy individuals. Serum RASSF1A methylation was determined by the MethyLight method. In addition, we followed up 43 HCC patients who were unable to undergo surgery for 24 months. RESULTS: Serum RASSF1A methylation occurred significantly more frequently in patients with HCC (122/190, 64.2%) than in patients with LC (20/114, 17.5%), patients with CHB (6/120, 5.0%) and in healthy individuals (0/160, 0) (P < 0.001); moreover, it allowed for the discrimination of patients with HCC from those with CHB with an areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of 0.796 (64.2% sensitivity and 89.8% specificity). Furthermore, the AUC for the combination of serum RASSF1A methylation and AFP level (>/=20 ng/L) was 0.876 (80.9% sensitivity and 93.4% specificity). Serum RASSF1A methylation positive in patients with HCC was associated with more malignant clinical characteristics and a worse overall survival (OS) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Serum RASSF1A methylation demonstrated a satisfactory value for in the diagnosis of HBV related HCC, and could predict clinical progression and prognosis.

In this study we measured genome-wide DNA methylation by luminometric methylation assay, a quantitative measurement of genome-wide DNA methylation, on DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 37 subjects with late-onset AD (LOAD) and 44 healthy controls (CT). We found an increase in global DNA methylation in LOAD subjects compared to CT (p=0.0122), associated with worse cognitive performances (p=0.0002). DNA hypermethylation in LOAD group was paralleled by higher DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene expression and protein levels.

Recently, methylation in a non-CpG context was found to occur widely on genomic DNA. Moreover, methylation of non-CpG sites is a highly controlled process, and its level may vary during cellular development. To study non-CpG methylation effects on DNA/protein interactions, we have chosen three human transcription factors (TFs): glucocorticoid receptor (GR), brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) - circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and estrogen receptor (ER) with methylated or unmethylated DNA binding sequences, using single-molecule and isothermal titration calorimetry assays. The results demonstrated that these TFs interact with methylated DNA with different effects compared with their cognate DNA sequences. The effects of non-CpG methylation on transcriptional regulation were validated by cell-based luciferase assay at protein level. The mechanisms of non-CpG methylation influencing DNA-protein interactions were investigated by crystallographic analyses and molecular dynamics simulation. With BisChIP-seq assays in HEK-293T cells, we found that GR can recognize highly methylated sites within chromatin in cells. Therefore, we conclude that non-CpG methylation of DNA can provide a mechanism for regulating gene expression through directly affecting the binding of TFs.",5.578,1441

Previous research identified a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from the promoter region of the serotonin 1B receptor gene as being associated with CU traits in boys with antisocial behaviour problems. This research tested the hypothesis that CU traits are associated with reduced methylation of the promoter region of the serotonin 1B receptor gene due to the influence of methylation on gene expression. Participants (N = 117) were boys with antisocial behaviour problems aged 3-16 years referred to University of New South Wales Child Behaviour Research Clinics. Participants volunteered a saliva sample from which the genotype of a SNP from the promoter region of the serotonin 1B receptor gene and the methylation levels of 30 CpG sites from 3 CpG regions surrounding the location of this polymorphism were assayed. Lower levels of serotonin 1B receptor gene methylation were associated with higher levels of CU traits. This relationship, however, was found to be moderated by genotype and carried exclusively by two CpG sites for which levels of methylation were negatively associated with overall methylation levels in this region of the gene. Results provide support to the emerging literature that argues for a genetically-driven system-wide alteration in serotonin function in the aetiology of CU traits. Furthermore, the results suggest that there may be two pathways to CU traits that involve methylation of the serotonin 1B receptor gene; one that is driven by a genotypic risk and another that is associated with risk for generally increased levels of methylation. Future research that aims to replicate and further investigate these results is required.",3.234,1160
26110029,Aberrant methylation patterns in cancer: a clinical view.,"['Paska AV', 'Hudler P']",Biochemia medica,2015,"Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins affecting nucleosome remodelling, and regulation by small and large non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) work in concert with cis and trans acting elements to drive appropriate gene expression. Advances in detection methods and development of dedicated platforms and methylation arrays resulted in an explosion of information on aberrantly methylated sequences linking deviations in epigenetic landscape with the initiation and progression of complex diseases. Here, we consider how DNA methylation changes in malignancies, such as breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and gastric cancer could be exploited for the purpose of developing specific diagnostic tools. DNA methylation changes can be applicable as biomarkers for detection of malignant disease in easily accessible tissues. Methylation signatures are already proving to be an important marker for determination of drug sensitivity. Even more, promoter methylation patterns of some genes, such as MGMT, SHOX2, and SEPT9, have already been translated into commercial clinical assays aiding in patient assessment as adjunct diagnostic tools. In conclusion, the changes in DNA methylation patterns in tumour cells are slowly gaining entrance into routine diagnostic tests as promising biomarkers and as potential therapeutic targets.",2.667,824

Cardiovascular genetics,2014,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic alterations may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. In particular, DNA methylation, a reversible and highly regulated DNA modification, could influence disease onset and progression because it functions as an effector for environmental influences, including diet and lifestyle, both of which are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: To address the role of DNA methylation changes in atherosclerosis, we compared a donor-matched healthy and atherosclerotic human aorta sample using whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing. We observed that the atherosclerotic portion of the aorta was hypermethylated across many genomic loci in comparison with the matched healthy counterpart. Furthermore, we defined specific loci of differential DNA methylation using a set of donor-matched aortic samples and a high-density (>450 000 CpG sites) DNA methylation microarray. The functional importance in the disease was corroborated by crossing the DNA methylation signature with the corresponding expression data of the same samples. Among the differentially methylated CpGs associated with atherosclerosis onset, we identified genes participating in endothelial and smooth muscle functions. These findings provide new clues toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify an atherosclerosis-specific DNA methylation profile that highlights the contribution of different genes and pathways to the disorder. Interestingly, the observed gain of DNA methylation in the atherosclerotic lesions justifies efforts to develop DNA demethylating agents for therapeutic benefit.",4.6,1334

The substantially decreased methylation of cg27091787 in BC cases was confirmed in two validation rounds (first validation round with 338 BC case and 507 controls: p < 0.0001; second validation round with 189 BC case and 189 controls: p < 0.0001). In addition to cg27091787, the decreased methylation of a 650-bp CpG island shore of HYAL2 was also associated with increased risk of BC. Moreover, the expression and methylation of HYAL2 were inversely correlated with a p-value of 0.006. To note, the BC-associated decreased HYAL2 methylation was replicated in the T-cell fraction (p = 0.034). The cg27091787 methylation level enabled a powerful discrimination of early-stage BC cases (stages 0 and I) from healthy controls [area under curve (AUC) = 0.89], and was robust for the detection of BC in younger women as well (age < 50, AUC = 0.87).

We show lineage-specific gene-body DNA methylation recruits H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1, which methylates H3K9 immediately downstream of transcription start sites marked with H3K4me3 to establish the bivalent domain.

AIM: To evaluate the methylation level of GSTP1 promoter in acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure and determine its predictive value for prognosis. METHODS: One hundred and five patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure, 86 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 30 healthy controls (HC) were retrospectively enrolled. GSTP1 methylation level in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) was detected by MethyLight. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained. RESULTS: GSTP1 methylation levels were significantly higher in patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (median 16.84%, interquartile range 1.83-59.05%) than those with CHB (median 1.25%, interquartile range 0.48-2.47%; P < 0.01) and HC (median 0.80%, interquartile range 0.67-1.27%; P < 0.01). In acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure group, nonsurvivors showed significantly higher GSTP1 methylation levels (P < 0.05) than survivors. GSTP1 methylation level was significantly correlated with total bilirubin (r = 0.29, P < 0.01), prothrombin time activity (r = -0.24, P = 0.01) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (r = 0.26, P = 0.01).

26913089,X chromosome-wide analysis identifies DNA methylation sites influenced by cigarette smoking.,"['Klebaner D', 'Huang Y', 'Hui Q', 'Taylor JY', 'Goldberg J', 'Vaccarino V', 'Sun YV']",Clinical epigenetics,2016,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major cause of chronic disease worldwide. Smoking may induce cellular and molecular changes including epigenetic modification, with both short-term and long-term modification patterns that may contribute to phenotypic expression of diseases. Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified dozens of smoking-related DNA methylation (DNAm) sites. However, the X chromosomal DNAm sites have been largely overlooked due to a lack of an analytical framework for dealing with the sex-dimorphic distribution. To identify novel smoking-related DNAm sites on the X chromosome, we examined the modality of each X chromosomal DNAm site and conducted a sex-specific association study of cigarette smoking. RESULTS: We used a discovery sample of 139 middle-age twins, and three replication samples of 78 twins, 464 and 333 unrelated individuals including 47, 17, 22, and 89 current smokers, respectively. After correction for multiple testing, the top smoking-related DNAm sites in BCOR and TSC22D3 were significantly hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively, among current smokers. These smoking-associated sites were replicated with meta-analysis p-values of 9.17 x 10(-12) and 1.61 x 10(-9). For both sites, the smoking effects on methylation levels were larger in males than that in females. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of investigating X chromosome methylation patterns and their associations with environmental exposures and disease phenotypes and demonstrate a robust statistical methodology for such study. Existing EWAS of human diseases should incorporate the X chromosomal sites to complete a comprehensive epigenome-wide scan.",4.543,600

We quantified the methylation level of BRCA1 promoter and evaluated its significance as prognostic and predictive factor. BRCA1 promoter methylation level was quantified by pyrosequencing in surgical cancerous and adjacent normal specimens from 154 BC patients. A follow up of 98 months was conducted to assess the correlation between BRCA1-methylation level vs. overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). The mean methylation level in BC tissues was significantly higher (mean 32.6%; median 31.9%) than in adjacent normal samples (mean 16.2%; median 13.0%) (P < 0.0001). Tumor stage (R = 0.6165, P < 0.0001) and size (R = 0.7328, P < 0.0001) were significantly correlated with the methylation level. Patients with unmethylated BRCA1 had a better OS and DFS compared to the methylated group (each P < 0.0001).

We hypothesize that long-term exposure to elevated blood lipids can prime circulating immune cells through changes in DNA methylation, a process that may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. To interrogate the causal relationship between triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and genome-wide DNA methylation while excluding confounding and pleiotropy, we perform a stepwise Mendelian randomization analysis in whole blood of 3296 individuals. RESULTS: This analysis shows that differential methylation is the consequence of inter-individual variation in blood lipid levels and not vice versa. Specifically, we observe an effect of triglycerides on DNA methylation at three CpGs, of LDL cholesterol at one CpG, and of HDL cholesterol at two CpGs using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Using RNA-seq data available for a large subset of individuals (N = 2044), DNA methylation of these six CpGs is associated with the expression of CPT1A and SREBF1 (for triglycerides), DHCR24 (for LDL cholesterol) and ABCG1 (for HDL cholesterol), which are all key regulators of lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests a role for epigenetic priming in end-product feedback control of lipid metabolism and highlights Mendelian randomization as an effective tool to infer causal relationships in integrative genomics data.",10.81,1634

Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxicants in vertebrates is associated with changes in DNA methylation, a major epigenetic mechanism affecting gene transcription. Zebra fish, a well-known model in toxicology and developmental biology, are emerging as a model species in environmental epigenetics despite their evolutionary distance to rodents and humans. In this review, recent insights in DNA methylation during zebra fish development are discussed and compared to mammalian models in order to evaluate zebra fish as a model to study the role of DNA methylation in environmental toxicology. Differences exist in DNA methylation reprogramming during early development, whereas in later developmental stages, tissue distribution of both 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine seems more conserved between species, as well as basic DNA (de)methylation mechanisms. All DNA methyl transferases identified so far in mammals are present in zebra fish, as well as a number of major demethylation pathways. However, zebra fish appear to lack some methylation pathways present in mammals, such as parental imprinting. Several studies report effects on DNA methylation in zebra fish following exposure to environmental contaminants, such as arsenic, benzo[a]pyrene, and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate. Though more research is needed to examine heritable effects of contaminant exposure on DNA methylation, recent data suggests the usefulness of the zebra fish as a model in environmental epigenetics.",3.359,223

In addition to branching and original acetylation, the only other difference between these two beta-1,4-linked glycans is the configuration at C-2 in approximately 80% of the sugar residues. In contrast to glucose, the 2-OH in mannose has an axial orientation. The influence of this stereochemistry on the relative reactivities of glucosyl compared to mannosyl units in methylation reactions are studied in this work. Glucomannan isolated from spruce (SGM) and commercially available konjac glucomannan (KGM) was methylated in DMSO/Li-dimsyl/MeI and water/NaOH/MeI system, respectively. In the early stage of the reaction, the glucose part of the SGM achieved slightly higher DS values than the mannose residues, but the overall relative rate constants were close to 1:1. The order of reactivities in glucose was k2>k3>k6 and k3>k2>k6 for mannose (in DMSO/Li-dimsyl/MeI). The rate constants did not remain constant, but k3 decreased when k2 increased for both epimeric sugars. In water/NaOH/MeI, the methylation of the primary 6-OH was much more pronounced with an order of reactivity of O-6>O-2>O-3 for mannose and O-2>O-6>O-3 for glucose.

26850505,The multivariate association between genomewide DNA methylation and climate across the range of Arabidopsis thaliana.,"['Keller TE', 'Lasky JR', 'Yi SV']",Molecular ecology,2016,"Epigenetic changes can occur due to extracellular environmental conditions. Consequently, epigenetic mechanisms can play an intermediate role to translate environmental signals to intracellular changes. Such a role might be particularly important in plants, which often show strong local adaptation and have the potential for heritable epigenetic states. However, little is currently known about the role of epigenetic variation in the ecological mechanisms of adaptation. Here, we used multivariate redundancy analyses to examine genomewide associations between DNA methylation polymorphisms and climate variation in two independent panels of Arabidopsis accessions, including 122 Eurasian accessions as well as in a regional panel of 148 accessions in Sweden. At the single-nucleotide methylation level, climate and space (geographic spatial structure) explain small yet significant amount of variation in both panels. On the other hand, when viewed in a context of genomic clusters of methylated and unmethylated cytosines, climate and space variables explain much greater amounts of variation in DNA methylation than those explained by variation at the single-nucleotide level. We found that the single-nucleotide methylation polymorphisms with the strongest associations with climate were enriched in transposable elements and in potentially RNA-directed methylation contexts. When viewed in the context of genomic clusters, variation of DNA methylation at different sequence contexts exhibit distinctive segregation along different axes of variation in the redundancy analyses. Genomewide methylation showed much stronger associations with climate within the regional panel (Sweden) compared to the global (Eurasia). Together, these findings indicate that genetic and epigenetic variation across the genome may play a role in response to climate conditions and local adaptation.",6.494,1848

MicroRNAs (miRs) have central roles during tumor metastasis and many miR genes are potentially subjected to control by DNA methylation in multiple tumor types. Recently, miR-34 and miR-124 have been demonstrated as potential regulators of the metastasis process in several cancer types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the methylation status of miR-34 and miR-124 families in 157 patients with NSCLC using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and evaluated the clinical effect of their methylation on the patients' prognosis. RESULTS: Methylation was detected in 30.6% for miR-34a, 40.8% for miR-34b/c, 30.6% for miR-124-1, 49.7% for miR-124-2, and 51.6% for miR-124-3 in NSCLC tissue. miR-34b/c methylation was significantly associated with age, gender, smoking status, histologic type, and pathologic stage. miR-34b/c, miR-124-2, and miR-124-3 methylation were significantly associated with worse survival in all patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj] for miR-34b/c, 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.95-5.74; P < .0001; HRadj for miR-124-2, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.19-3.32; P = .009; and HRadj for miR-124-3, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.24-3.55; P = .006). When miR-34b/c and miR-124-3 methylation were combined, overall survival decreased as the number of methylations increased (Ptrend < .0001).

This study explored differential DNA methylation in a priori selected genes to diagnose PCa and predict clinical failure (CF) in high-risk patients. METHODS: A quantitative multiplex, methylation-specific PCR assay was developed to assess promoter methylation of the APC, CCND2, GSTP1, PTGS2 and RARB genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 42 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and radical prostatectomy specimens of patients with high-risk PCa, encompassing training and validation cohorts of 147 and 71 patients, respectively. Log-rank tests, univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to investigate the prognostic value of the DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of APC, CCND2, GSTP1, PTGS2 and RARB was highly cancer-specific. However, only GSTP1 methylation was significantly associated with CF in both independent high-risk PCa cohorts. Importantly, trichotomization into low, moderate and high GSTP1 methylation level subgroups was highly predictive for CF. Patients with either a low or high GSTP1 methylation level, as compared to the moderate methylation groups, were at a higher risk for CF in both the training (Hazard ratio [HR], 3.65; 95% CI, 1.65 to 8.07) and validation sets (HR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.03 to 17.72) as well as in the combined cohort (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.42 to 5.27) in multivariate analysis.

Here we perform a comprehensive, high-resolution analysis of chromatin structure to compare the landscapes of HCT116 colon cancer cells and a DNA methylation-deficient derivative. The NOMe-seq accessibility assay unexpectedly revealed symmetrical and transcription-independent nucleosomal phasing across active, poised, and inactive genomic elements. DNA methylation abolished this phasing primarily at enhancers and CpG island (CGI) promoters, with little effect on insulators and non-CGI promoters. Abolishment of DNA methylation led to the context-specific reestablishment of the poised and active states of normal colon cells, which were marked in methylation-deficient cells by distinct H3K27 modifications and the presence of either well-phased nucleosomes or nucleosome-depleted regions, respectively. At higher-order genomic scales, we found that long, H3K9me3-marked domains had lower accessibility, consistent with a more compact chromatin structure. Taken together, our results demonstrate the nuanced and context-dependent role of DNA methylation in the functional, multiscale organization of cancer epigenomes.",14.63,1101

Repressive marks such as DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation silence these elements and maintain genome integrity. However, how silencing mechanisms are themselves regulated to avoid the silencing of genes remains unclear. Here, an anti-silencing factor was identified using a forward genetic screen on a reporter line that harbors a LUCIFERASE (LUC) gene driven by a promoter that undergoes DNA methylation. SUVH1, a Su(var)3-9 homolog, was identified as a factor promoting the expression of the LUC gene. Treatment with a cytosine methylation inhibitor completely suppressed the LUC expression defects of suvh1, indicating that SUVH1 is dispensable for LUC expression in the absence of DNA methylation. SUVH1 also promotes the expression of several endogenous genes with promoter DNA methylation. However, the suvh1 mutation did not alter DNA methylation levels at the LUC transgene or on a genome-wide scale; thus, SUVH1 functions downstream of DNA methylation. Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation was reduced in suvh1; in contrast, H3K9 methylation levels remained unchanged. This work has uncovered a novel, anti-silencing function for a member of the Su(var)3-9 family that has previously been associated with silencing through H3K9 methylation.",9.112,166

Efficient and user-friendly tools are critical in carrying out such analysis on high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data. However, existing tools are either not scalable well, or inadequate in providing visualization and other desirable functionalities. RESULTS: In order to handle ultra large sequencing data and to provide additional functions and features, we have developed BSPAT, a fast online tool for bisulfite sequencing pattern analysis. With a user-friendly web interface, BSPAT seamlessly integrates read mapping/quality control/methylation calling with methylation pattern generation and visualization. BSPAT has the following important features: 1) instead of using multiple/pairwise sequence alignment methods, BSPAT adopts an efficient and widely used sequence mapping tool to provide fast alignment of sequence reads; 2) BSPAT summarizes and visualizes DNA methylation co-occurrence patterns at a single nucleotide level, which provide valuable information in understanding the mechanism and regulation of DNA methylation; 3) based on methylation co-occurrence patterns, BSPAT can automatically detect potential allele-specific methylation (ASM) patterns, which can greatly enhance the detection and analysis of ASM patterns; 4) by linking directly with other popular databases and tools, BSPAT allows users to perform integrative analysis of methylation patterns with other genomic features together within regions of interest. CONCLUSION: By utilizing a real bisulfite sequencing dataset generated from prostate cancer cell lines, we have shown that BSPAT is highly efficient. It has also reported some interesting methylation co-occurrence patterns and a potential allele-specific methylation case. In conclusion, BSPAT is an efficient and convenient tool for high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data analysis that can be broadly used.",2.576,445
27250895,DNA methylation and Cancer: Identifying and targeting epigenetic modifications may be the future of cancer therapy?,"['Maresca G', 'Wismayer PS']",The Gulf journal of oncology,2016,"DNA methylation has been recognized as one of the most important epigenetic mechanisms regulating the expression and inhibition of genes giving rise to an organism's phenotype. It is hence of no surprise that when DNA methylation mechanisms are disrupted by intrinsic or extrinsic causes, the likelihood of tumourigenesis increases. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation may predispose to cancer formation through aberrant inhibition or expression of particular genes and this is seen in different types of cancers, such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. By increasing our knowledge and understanding of these epigenetic mechanisms, we will be able to develop diagnostic techniques such as methylation profiling, to screen for and detect aberrant methylation patterns which may predispose to cancer formation in our patients. This would enable early diagnosis and treatment which may also involve the use of drugs developed to provide directed epigenetic therapy, shifting away from the current trend which involves the use of radical anti-cancer therapy. These diagnostic and treatment options may be the future of cancer management.",0,1812

The aim of the present study was to carry out a systematic review and a meta-analysis in order to evaluate DAPK1 promoter methylation as an epigenetic marker for CC risk. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out. The Cochrane software package Review Manager 5.2 was used. The fixed-effects or random-effects models, according to heterogeneity across studies, were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted by histological type, assays used to evaluate DAPK1 promoter methylation, and control sample source. RESULTS: A total of 20 papers, published between 2001 and 2014, on 1929 samples, were included in the meta-analysis. DAPK1 promoter methylation was associated with an increased CC risk based on the random effects model (OR: 21.20; 95%CI = 11.14-40.35). Omitting the most heterogeneous study, the between study heterogeneity decreased and the association increased (OR: 24.13; 95% CI = 15.83-36.78). The association was also confirmed in all the subgroups analyses. CONCLUSIONS: A significant strong association between DAPK1 promoter methylation and CC was shown and confirmed independently by histological tumor type, method used to evaluate methylation and source of control samples. Methylation markers may have value in early detection of CC precursor lesions, provide added reassurances of safety for women who are candidates for less frequent screens, and predict outcomes of women infected with human papilloma virus.",3.234,1653

Associations between global DNA methylation and FAs were sought in blood from lactating infants (LI; n = 49) and adult males (AMM; n = 12) equally distributed across the three conventional BMI classes. AMM provided multiple samples at 2-hour intervals during 8 hours after either a single Western diet-representative meal (post-prandial samples) or no meal (fasting samples). Lipid/glucose profile, HDAC4 promoter and PDK4 5'UTR methylation were determined in AMM. Multiple regression analysis revealed that global (in LI) and both global and PDK4-specific DNA methylation (in AMM) were positively associated with eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acid. HDAC4 methylation was inversely associated with arachidonic acid post-prandially in AMM. Global DNA methylation did not show any defined within-day pattern that would suggest a short-term response to the diet. Nonetheless, global DNA methylation was higher in normal weight subjects both post-prandially and in fasting and coincided with higher polyunsaturated relative to monounsaturated and saturated FAs.

Here, I will focus on DNA methylation as a reversible epigenetic modification of DNA that has been studied in great detail at the level of the genome. Recent advances in sequencing have identified unexpected dynamics of this modification, which are tightly linked to gene regulation. Understanding how DNA methylation patterns are read and how they contribute to regulation will be critical to interpret and utilize genomic maps of DNA methylation.

Such techniques are also useful and applicable to experimental reproductive biology. In order to expand our knowledge of epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, during mammalian reproduction and early development, it is necessary to test new and sufficiently sensitive protocols. There are, however, unique challenges to obtain DNA methylation data from the small cell numbers that are present in the preimplantation embryo. In this protocol, we describe the successful application of Pyrosequencing((R)) to yield quantitative DNA methylation data over several CpG sites at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at imprinted loci in single blastocysts, in this case, human blastocysts.

Our understanding of this crucial modification may even contribute to the treatment and prevention of age-related illnesses in the very near future. Genome-wide methylation analysis using high throughput DNA technologies has discovered numerous differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) which differ in levels of methylation in various cell types and tissues. TDMRs have been useful in various applications, particularly medicine and forensic sciences. Forensic scientists are constantly seeking exciting and novel methods to aid in the reconstruction of crime scenes, and the analysis of tDMRs represents a new and reliable technique to identify biological fluids and tissues found at the scene of a violent act.

METHODS: Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa in different gastric carcinogenesis stages with H. pylori infection, that is, non-atrophic gastritis (NAG; n = 24), chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG; n = 25), intestinal metaplasia (IM; n = 28), dysplasia (DYS; n = 24), and gastric cancer (GC; n = 30), as well as specimens of normal gastric mucosa without H. pylori infection (NGM; n = 25), were confirmed by endoscopy and pathological examination. Cx32 and Cx43 mRNA expression was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cx32 and Cx43 promoter CpG island methylation status was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), bisulfite PCR sequencing (BSP) and MassArray methods. RESULTS: The relative mRNA expression levels in the gastric mucosa of patients with NGM, NAG, CAG, IM, DYS and GC were 0.146 +/- 0.011, 0.133 +/- 0.026, 0.107 +/- 0.035, 0.039 +/- 0.032, 0.037 +/- 0.01 and 0.03 +/- 0.011 for Cx32; and 0.667 +/- 0.057, 0.644 +/- 0.051, 0.624 +/- 0.049, 0.555 +/- 0.067, 0.536 +/- 0.058 and 0.245 +/- 0.121 for Cx43, respectively, which were gradually decreasing and significantly different (GC vs NGM: P < 0.001 for Cx32, P < 0.001 for Cx43).

To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed associations, we measured global methylation levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to glucose, insulin and lipids. RESULTS: Global methylation levels (+/-SD) were significantly higher in OVAT (74.27% +/- 2.2%) compared with SAT (71.97% +/- 2.4%; paired t test, p < 1 x 10(-9)). Furthermore, global methylation levels in SAT were positive correlates of measures of fat distribution (waist measurement, WHR) and glucose homeostasis (HbA1c) (all p < 0.015 after accounting for multiple testing and covariates). Global methylation levels in the German Sorb cohort were associated with glucose homeostasis, but this association did not withstand adjustment for covariates. Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to insulin, palmitate and glucose decreased global methylation levels 1 h after treatment relative to controls.

In addition to myeloid malignancies, mutations in DNMT3A have been recently reported in T-cell lymphoma and leukemia, implying a possible involvement in the pathogenesis of human diseases. However, the role of Dnmt3a in T-cell transformation in vivo is poorly understood. Here we analyzed the functional consequences of Dnmt3a inactivation in a mouse model of MYC-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis (MTCL). Loss of Dnmt3a delayed tumorigenesis by suppressing cellular proliferation during disease progression. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis identified upregulation of 17 putative tumor suppressor genes, including DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b, in Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas as molecular events potentially responsible for the delayed lymphomagenesis in Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) mice. Interestingly, promoter and gene body methylation of these genes was not substantially changed between control and Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a may inhibit their expression in a methylation-independent manner. Re-expression of both wild type and catalytically inactive Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) lymphoma cells in vitro inhibited Dnmt3b expression, indicating that Dnmt3b upregulation may be directly repressed by Dnmt3a. Importantly, genetic inactivation of Dnmt3b accelerated lymphomagenesis in Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) mice, demonstrating that upregulation of Dnmt3b is a relevant molecular change in Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas that inhibits disease progression. Collectively, our data demonstrate an unexpected oncogenic role for Dnmt3a in MTCL through methylation-independent repression of Dnmt3b and possibly other tumor suppressor genes.",8.459,1451

Here we present a catalogue of the genetic influences on DNA methylation (methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL)) at five different life stages in human blood: children at birth, childhood, adolescence and their mothers during pregnancy and middle age. RESULTS: We show that genetic effects on methylation are highly stable across the life course and that developmental change in the genetic contribution to variation in methylation occurs primarily through increases in environmental or stochastic effects. Though we map a large proportion of the cis-acting genetic variation, a much larger component of genetic effects influencing methylation are acting in trans. However, only 7 % of discovered mQTL are trans-effects, suggesting that the trans component is highly polygenic. Finally, we estimate the contribution of mQTL to variation in complex traits and infer that methylation may have a causal role consistent with an infinitesimal model in which many methylation sites each have a small influence, amounting to a large overall contribution. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation contains a significant heritable component that remains consistent across the lifespan.

DRB1 and DRB2 are involved in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, while DRB4 functions in cytoplasmic posttranscriptional small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways. DRB3 and DRB5 are not involved in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) processing but assist in silencing transcripts targeted by DRB2-associated miRNAs. The goal of this study was to determine which, if any, of the DRB proteins might also participate in a nuclear siRNA pathway that leads to geminivirus genome methylation. Here, we demonstrate that DRB3 functions with Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) and Argonaute 4 (AGO4) in methylation-mediated antiviral defense. Plants employ repressive viral genome methylation as an epigenetic defense against geminiviruses, using an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway similar to that used to suppress endogenous invasive DNAs such as transposons. Chromatin methylation inhibits virus replication and transcription, and methylation-deficient host plants are hypersusceptible to geminivirus infection. Using a panel of drb mutants, we found that drb3 plants uniquely exhibit a similar hypersensitivity and that viral genome methylation is substantially reduced in drb3 compared to wild-type plants. In addition, like dcl3 and ago4 mutants, drb3 plants fail to recover from infection and cannot accomplish the viral genome hypermethylation that is invariably observed in asymptomatic, recovered tissues. Small RNA analysis, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that DRB3 acts downstream of siRNA biogenesis and suggest that it associates with DCL3 and AGO4 in distinct subnuclear compartments. These studies reveal that in addition to its previously established role in the miRNA pathway, DRB3 also functions in antiviral RdDM. IMPORTANCE: Plants use RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) as an epigenetic defense against geminiviruses. RNA silencing pathways in Arabidopsis include five double-stranded RNA binding proteins (DRBs) related to Drosophila R2D2 and mammalian TRBP and PACT. While DRB proteins have defined roles in miRNA and cytoplasmic siRNA pathways, a role in nuclear RdDM was elusive. Here, we used the geminivirus system to show that DRB3 is involved in methylation-mediated antiviral defense. Beginning with a panel of Arabidopsis drb mutants, we demonstrated that drb3 plants uniquely show enhanced susceptibility to geminiviruses. Further, like dcl3 and ago4 mutants, drb3 plants fail to hypermethylate the viral genome, a requirement for host recovery. We also show that DRB3 physically interacts with the RdDM pathway components DCL3 and AGO4 in the nucleus. This work highlights the utility of geminiviruses as models for de novo RdDM and places DRB3 protein in this fundamental epigenetic pathway.",4.439,942

We herein present evidence that GATA-1 binds to the PU.1 gene and inhibits its expression in human AML-erythroleukemias (EL). Furthermore, GATA-1 together with DNA methyl Transferase I (DNMT1) mediate repression of the PU.1 gene through the URE. Repression of the PU.1 gene involves both DNA methylation at the URE and its histone H3 lysine-K9 methylation and deacetylation as well as the H3K27 methylation at additional DNA elements and the promoter.

Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of ion transport and cell cycle genes, leading to altered calcium handling and cell cycle defects. We further determined that myocardial Kmt2d deletion led to decreased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at enhancers and promoters. Finally, we identified KMT2D-bound regions in cardiomyocytes, of which a subset was associated with decreased gene expression and decreased H3K4me2 in mutant hearts. This subset included genes related to ion transport, hypoxia-reoxygenation and cell cycle regulation, suggesting that KMT2D is important for these processes.

Temporal change is one source of within-person variation in DNA methylation that has been linked to aging and disease. METHODS: We analyzed CpG-site-specific intraindividual variation and short-term temporal trend in leukocyte DNA methylation among 24 healthy Chinese women, with blood samples drawn at study entry and after 9 months. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to measure methylation. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and trend estimates were summarized by genomic location and probe type. RESULTS: The median ICC was 0.36 across nonsex chromosomes and 0.80 on the X chromosome. There was little difference in ICC profiles by genomic region and probe type. Among CpG loci with high variability between participants, more than 99% had ICC > 0.8. Statistically significant trend was observed in 10.9% CpG loci before adjustment for cell-type composition and in 3.4% loci after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: For CpG loci differentially methylated across subjects, methylation levels can be reliably assessed with one blood sample. More samples per subject are needed for low-variability and unmethylated loci. Temporal changes are largely driven by changes in cell-type composition of blood samples, but temporal trend unrelated to cell types is detected in a small percentage of CpG sites. IMPACT: This study shows that one measurement can reliably assess methylation of differentially methylated CpG loci. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(3); 490-7. (c)2014 AACR.",2.711,1319

We previously proposed that Arabidopsis VIM/ORTH proteins with an SRA domain maintain DNA methylation and epigenetic gene silencing in heterochromatic regions. However, their endogenous targets of epigenetic gene silencing have not been analyzed globally and the mechanisms by which VIM proteins coordinate DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing are largely unknown. In this study, a genome-wide transcript profiling analysis revealed 544 derepressed genes in a vim1/2/3 triple mutant, including 133 known genes. VIM1 bound to promoter and transcribed regions of the up-regulated genes in vim1/2/3 and VIM deficiency caused severe DNA hypomethylation in all sequence contexts at direct VIM1 targets. We found a drastic loss of H3K9me2 at heterochromatic chromocenters in vim1/2/3 nuclei. Furthermore, aberrant changes in transcriptionally active and repressive histone modifications were observed at VIM1 targets in vim1/2/3. VIM1-binding capacity to target genes was significantly reduced in the met1 background, indicating that VIM1 primarily recognizes CG methylation deposited by MET1. Overall, our data indicate that VIM proteins regulate genome-wide epigenetic gene silencing through coordinated modulation of DNA methylation and histone modification status in collaboration with MET1.",6.337,1866

The level of DNA methylation controls plant gene expression on a global level. We have examined impacts of global changes in DNA methylation on the Arabidopsis immune system. A range of hypo-methylated mutants displayed enhanced resistance to the biotrophic pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa), whereas two hyper-methylated mutants were more susceptible to this pathogen. Subsequent characterization of the hypo-methylated nrpe1 mutant, which is impaired in RNA-directed DNA methylation, and the hyper-methylated ros1 mutant, which is affected in DNA demethylation, revealed that their opposite resistance phenotypes are associated with changes in cell wall defence and salicylic acid (SA)-dependent gene expression. Against infection by the necrotrophic pathogen Plectosphaerella cucumerina, nrpe1 showed enhanced susceptibility, which was associated with repressed sensitivity of jasmonic acid (JA)-inducible gene expression. Conversely, ros1 displayed enhanced resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, which was not associated with increased responsiveness of JA-inducible gene expression. Although nrpe1 and ros1 were unaffected in systemic acquired resistance to Hpa, they failed to develop transgenerational acquired resistance against this pathogen. Global transcriptome analysis of nrpe1 and ros1 at multiple time-points after Hpa infection revealed that 49% of the pathogenesis-related transcriptome is influenced by NRPE1- and ROS1-controlled DNA methylation. Of the 166 defence-related genes displaying augmented induction in nrpe1 and repressed induction in ros1, only 25 genes were associated with a nearby transposable element and NRPE1- and/or ROS1-controlled DNA methylation. Accordingly, we propose that the majority of NRPE1- and ROS1-dependent defence genes are regulated in trans by DNA methylation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",0,632

AS3MT activity requires the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, a product of folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, and a reductant. Although glutathione (GSH), the primary endogenous antioxidant, is not required for As methylation, GSH stimulates As methylation rates in vitro. However, the relationship between GSH redox and As methylation capacity in humans is unknown. We wished to test the hypothesis that a more oxidized plasma GSH redox status is associated with decreased As methylation capacity and examine whether these associations are modified by folate nutritional status. Concentrations of plasma GSH and GSSG, plasma folate, total blood As (bAs), total urinary As (uAs), and uAs metabolites were assessed in a cross-sectional study of n=376 Bangladeshi adults who were chronically exposed to As in drinking water. We observed that a decreased plasma GSH/GSSG ratio (reflecting a more oxidized redox state) was significantly associated with increased urinary %MMA, decreased urinary %DMA, and increased total bAs in folate-deficient individuals (plasma folate </= 9.0 nmol/L). Concentrations of plasma GSH and GSSG were independently associated with increased and decreased As methylation capacity, respectively. No significant associations were observed in folate-sufficient individuals, and interactions by folate status were statistically significant.

Previous studies have demonstrated that CEBPA is regulated by DNA methylation and involved in the osteogenesis and adipogenesis of mouse C3H10T1/2 and bone marrow stromal cells. However, it is unclear whether CEBPA is regulated by DNA methylation in adipose tissues. Thus, the objectives of the present study were to investigate CpG site methylation in a 357-bp CEBPA promoter region and to assess the correlation between promoter CpG site methylation and CEBPA gene expression in the abdominal adipose tissues of Northeast Agricultural University broiler lines divergently selected for abdominal fat content. The results showed that the methylation percentage of the analyzed CEBPA promoter region was significantly higher in lean broilers than in fat broilers at 2 weeks (80.3% vs. 43.4%, P < 0.0001), 3 weeks (95.4% vs. 74.0%, P < 0.0001) and 7 weeks of age (82.6% vs. 57.2%, P < 0.0001). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that CEBPA expression was significantly higher in the fat vs. the lean line at 2 weeks of age (P = 0.0013) but not at 3 or 7 weeks of age. The correlation analysis showed that only at 2 weeks of age was the methylation percentage negatively correlated with CEBPA expression (Pearson's r = -0.8312, P = 0.0029).

The results of the present study demonstrated that DRD4 promoter methylation was significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. A further breakdown analysis by gender revealed that there was a significant association of DRD4 promoter methylation with AD in males (23 patients and 45 controls).

25998525,Deciphering UV-B-induced variation in DNA methylation pattern and its influence on regulation of DBR2 expression in Artemisia annua L.,"['Pandey N', 'Pandey-Rai S']",Planta,2015,"MAIN CONCLUSION: UV-B-caused DNA hypomethylation and UV-B-mediated epigenetic activation of additional WRKY-binding site(s) in the DBR2 promoter may contribute to the overexpression of the DBR2 gene in Artemisia annua. DNA methylation is one of the key mechanisms behind stress-induced transcriptional switch off/on. Here, we evaluate the DNA methylation level in response to UV-B radiation in Artemisia annua which produces artemisinin, a sesquiterpene that has been recommended by WHO for the frontline treatment of malaria. However, the drug is facing serious shortage due to its low concentration in plants. UV-B treatment (3 h) enhanced artemisinin concentration up to 1.91-fold as compared to control. A key regulatory gene of artemisinin biosynthesis, DBR2 was upregulated under UV-B. This study presents observations regarding contributions of DNA methylation to the gene regulation using DBR2 as an example. Restriction digestion of genomic DNA by isoschizomers (MspI and HpaII) suggested UV-B involvement in DNA hypomethylation in A. annua. The global level of DNA methylation (R) was 3.4 and 5.9% for UV-B treated and control plants, respectively, attesting hypomethylation of DNA in response to UV-B. Further bisulfite sequencing PCR showed demethylation at two CHG sites in 18S rRNA gene. Similarly, bisulfite sequencing of promoter region of DBR2 has demonstrated demethylation at 4 CG-, 4 CHH- and 2 CHG-sites. In silico analysis revealed UV-B-mediated demethylation at seven putative transcription factor binding sites including WRKY, which are positive regulators of artemisinin biosynthesis. UV-B treatment has resulted in activation of additional WRKY-binding site in UV-B-treated plants compared with single active WRKY-binding site in control and this could be the probable reason for overexpression of DBR2. It is suggested that DNA demethylation is an important epigenetic response to UV-B radiation in A. annua that surely will provide new horizons to further elucidate the mechanistic evidence of plant's responses to UV-B radiation.",3.263,1478
27480590,Inbreeding effects on gene-specific DNA methylation among tissues of Chinook salmon.,"['Venney CJ', 'Johansson ML', 'Heath DD']",Molecular ecology,2016,"Inbreeding depression is the loss of fitness resulting from the mating of genetically-related individuals. Traditionally, the study of inbreeding depression focused on genetic effects, though recent research has identified DNA methylation as also having a role in inbreeding effects. Since inbreeding depression and DNA methylation change with age and environmental stress, DNA methylation is a likely candidate for the regulation of genes associated with inbreeding depression. Here we use a targeted, multi-gene approach to assess methylation at 22 growth, metabolic, immune, and stress-related genes. We developed PCR-based DNA methylation assays to test the effects of intense inbreeding on intragenic gene-specific methylation in inbred and outbred Chinook salmon. Inbred fish had altered methylation at three genes, CK-1, GTIIBS, and hsp70, suggesting that methylation changes associated with inbreeding depression are targeted to specific genes and are not whole-genome effects. While we did not find a significant inbreeding by age interaction, we found that DNA methylation generally increases with age, though methylation decreased with age in five genes, CK-1, IFN, HNRNP, hsc71, and FSHb, potentially due to environmental context and sexual maturation. As expected, we found methylation patterns differed among tissue types, highlighting the need for careful selection of target tissue for methylation studies. This study provides insight into the role of epigenetic effects on aging, environment and tissue function in Chinook salmon and shows that methylation is a targeted and regulated cellular process. We provide the first evidence of epigenetically-based inbreeding depression in vertebrates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",6.494,426

In this study, we investigated the expression, methylation status, and functional role of CYP1A1 on prostate cancer cells. Increased expression of CYP1A1 was observed in all cancer lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145) compared to BPH-1 (P < 0.05); and was enhanced further by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment (P < 0.01). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA of the xenobiotic response element (XRE) enhancer site XRE-1383 indicated promoter methylation as a regulator of CYP1A1 expression. In tissue, microarrays showed higher immunostaining of CYP1A1 in prostate cancer than normal and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; P < 0.001), and methylation analyses in clinical specimens revealed significantly lower methylation levels in cancer compared to BPH at all enhancer sites analyzed (XRE-1383, XRE-983, XRE-895; P < 0.01). Interestingly, smoking affected the XRE-1383 site where the methylation level was much lower in cancer tissues from smokers than non-smokers (P < 0.05). CYP1A1 levels are thus increased in prostate cancer and to determine the functional effect of CYP1A1 on cells, we depleted the gene in LNCaP and DU145 by siRNA. We observe that CYP1A1 knockdown decreased cell proliferation (P < 0.05) and increased apoptosis (P < 0.01) in both cell lines. We analyzed genes affected by CYP1A1 silencing and found that apoptosis-related BCL2 was significantly down-regulated. This study supports an oncogenic role for CYP1A1 in prostate cancer via promoter hypomethylation that is influenced by tobacco smoking, indicating CYP1A1 to be a promising target for prostate cancer treatment.",6.359,1132

This study examined associations between exposure to institutional care, quantified as the proportion of time in institutional care at specified follow-up assessment ages, and DNA methylation status in two stress-related genes: FKBP5 and SLC6A4. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, which is a prospective study in which children reared in institutional settings were randomly assigned (mean age 22 months) to either newly created foster care or care as usual (to remain in their current placement) and prospectively followed. A group of children from the same geographic area, with no history of institutionalized caregiving, were also recruited. DNA methylation status was determined in DNA extracted from buccal epithelial cells of children at age 12. RESULTS: An inverse association was identified such that more time spent in institutional care was associated with lower DNA methylation at specific CpG sites within both genes. DISCUSSION: These results suggest a lasting impact of early severe social deprivation on methylation patterns in these genes, and contribute to a growing literature linking early adversity and epigenetic variation in children.

A substantial proportion of the variation in gene expression and DNA methylation is known to be under genetic control. We address the proportion of genetic control that is shared between these two genomic features. RESULTS: An exhaustive search for pairwise phenotypic correlations between gene expression and DNA methylation in samples from human blood (n = 610) was performed. Of the 5 x 10(9) possible pairwise tests, 0.36 % passed Bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of 9.9 x 10(-12). We determined that the correlation structure between probe pairs was largely due to blood cell type specificity of the expression and methylation probes. Upon adjustment of the expression and methylation values for observed blood cellular composition (n = 422), the number of probe pairs which survived Bonferroni correction reduced by more than 5400 fold. Of the 614 correlated probe pairs located on the same chromosome, 75 % share at least one methylation and expression QTL at nominal 10(-5) p-value cutoff. Those probe pairs are located within 1Mbp window from each other and have a mean of absolute value of genetic correlation equal to 0.69, further demonstrating the high degree of shared genetic control.

H3K36M mutant nucleosomes inhibit the enzymatic activities of several H3K36 methyltransferases. Depleting H3K36 methyltransferases, or expressing an H3K36I mutant that similarly inhibits H3K36 methylation, is sufficient to phenocopy the H3K36M mutation. After the loss of H3K36 methylation, a genome-wide gain in H3K27 methylation leads to a redistribution of polycomb repressive complex 1 and de-repression of its target genes known to block mesenchymal differentiation.

27346523,DNA methylation in fibrosis.,"['Dowson C', ""O'Reilly S""]",European journal of cell biology,2016,"Fibrosis is characterised by an exuberant wound healing response and the major cell type responsible is the myofibroblast. The myofibroblast is typified by excessive ECM production and contractile activity and is demarcated by alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. What has recently come to light is that the activation of the fibroblast to myofibroblast may be under epigenetic control, specifically methylation. Methylation of DNA is a conserved mechanism to precisely regulate gene expression in a specific context. Hypermethylation leads to gene repression and hypomethylation results in gene induction. Methylation abnormalities have recently been uncovered in fibrosis, both organ specific and widespread fibrosis. The fact that these methylation changes are rapid and reversible lends themselves amenable to therapeutic intervention. This review considers the role of methylation in fibrosis and the activation of the myofibroblasts and how this could be targeted for fibrosis. Fibrosis is of course currently intractable to therapeutics and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and is an urgent unmet clinical need.",3.825,1635

However, a robust procedure for the labeling of amino acids has not yet been established. In this study, the (11) C-methylation of Schiff-base-activated alpha-amino acid derivatives has been optimized for the radiosynthesis of various alpha-(11) C-methyl amino acids. The benzophenone imine analog of methyl 2-amino butyrate was (11) C-methylated with [(11) C]methyl iodide following its initial deprotonation with potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). The use of an alternative base such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride, triethylamine, and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene did not result in the (11) C-methylated product. Furthermore, the KOtBu-promoted (11) C-methylation of the Schiff-base-activated amino acid analog was enhanced by the addition of 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) and inhibited by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline. These results suggest that inhibition of radical generation induced by KOtBu improves the alpha-(11) C-methylation of the Schiff-base-activated amino acids. The addition of a mixture of KOtBu and TEMPO to a solution of Schiff-base-activated amino acid ester and [(11) C]methyl iodide provided optimal results, and the tert-butyl ester and benzophenone imine groups could be readily hydrolyzed to give the desired alpha-(11) C-methyl amino acids with a high radiochemical conversion. This strategy could be readily applied to the synthesis of other alpha-(11) C-methyl amino acids.",1.273,332

Our study evaluated whether global DNA methylation predicted increased risk from T2DM or other carbohydrate metabolism disorders in a cohort study. We used a prospective cohort intervention study and a control group. We collected phenotypic, anthropometric, biochemical, and nutritional information from all subjects. Global LINE-1 DNA methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing technology. Subjects that did not improve their carbohydrate metabolism status showed lower levels of global LINE-1 DNA methylation (63.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 64.7 +/- 2.4) and they practiced less intense physical activity (5.8% vs. 21.5%). Logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between LINE-1 DNA methylation and metabolic status after adjustment for sex, age, BMI, and physical activity. Our study showed that lower LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were associated with a higher risk metabolic status worsening, independent of other classic risk factors. This finding highlights the potential role for epigenetic biomarkers as predictors of T2DM risk or other related metabolic disorders.",4.78,1328

By analysing TLR-deficient plasmacytoid dendritic cells and performing HEK293 genetic complementation assays we could demonstrate that the single 2'-O-methylation containing RNA still activated TLR8 but not TLR7. Therefore this specific 2'-O-ribose methylation in rRNA converts a TLR7/TLR8 ligand to an exclusively TLR8-specific ligand.

In a randomized controlled trial, we have previously shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation in pregnancy was associated with modified immune responses and some markers of immune maturation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these heritable effects are unclear. To determine whether the biological effects of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation are mediated through DNA methylation, we analyzed CD4(+) T-cells purified from cryo-banked cord blood samples from a previously conducted clinical trial. Of the 80 mother-infant pairs that completed the initial trial, cord blood samples of 70 neonates were available for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Comparison of purified total CD4(+) T-cell DNA methylation profiles between the supplement and control groups did not reveal any statistically significant differences in CpG methylation, at the single-CpG or regional level. Effect sizes among top-ranked probes were lower than 5% and did not warrant further validation. Tests for association between methylation levels and key n-3 PUFA parameters, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or total n-3 PUFAs were suggestive of dose-dependent effects, but these did not reach genome-wide significance. Our analysis of the microarray data did not suggest strong modifying effects of in utero n-3 PUFA exposure on CD4(+) T-cell methylation profiles, and no probes on the array met our criteria for further validation. Other epigenetic mechanisms may be more relevant mediators of functional effects induced by n-3 PUFA in early life.",4.78,944

Following fusion of the male and female gametes, it is widely accepted that murine DNA methylation marks at the DMRs of imprinted genes are stable through embryogenesis and early development, until they are reprogrammed in primordial germ cells. However, the DNA methylation dynamics at DMRs of bovine imprinted genes during early stages of development remains largely unknown. The objective of this investigation was to analyse the methylation dynamics at imprinted gene DMRs during bovine embryo development, from blastocyst stage until implantation. RESULTS: To this end, pyrosequencing technology was used to quantify DNA methylation at DMR-associated CpG dinucleotides of six imprinted bovine genes (SNRPN, MEST, IGF2R, PLAGL1, PEG10 and H19) using bisulfite-modified genomic DNA isolated from individual blastocysts (Day 7); ovoid embryos (Day 14); filamentous embryos (Day 17) and implanting conceptuses (Day 25). For all genes, the degree of DNA methylation was most variable in Day 7 blastocysts compared to later developmental stages (P < 0.05). Furthermore, mining of RNA-seq transcriptomic data and western blot analysis revealed a specific window of expression of DNA methylation machinery genes (including DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TRIM28/KAP1 and DNMT1) and proteins (DNMT3A, DNMT3A2 and DNMT3B) by bovine embryos coincident with imprint stabilization.

MicroRNA-153 (miR-153) exerts a tumor suppressive function in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by silencing oncogenic targets. However, the mechanism underlying miR-153 regulation in glioma cells has not been studied. METHODS: The expression levels of miR-153 were determined by real-time PCR and genomic bisulfite modification technique was used to detect the DNA methylation status in the upstream region of miR-153 in GBM, their matched normal adjacent tissues, and the glioblastoma U87 cell line. Following treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (5-aza-dC), the DNA methylation, gene expression and target proteins levels of miR-153 were determined. RESULTS: This study confirmed that miR-153 is significantly downregulated and hypermethylated in GBM tissues compared to their matched normal adjacent tissues. Increased methylation level of miR-153 was significantly correlated with reduced miR-153 expression in GBM tissue specimens. Demethylation of cells by 5-aza-dC treatment led to reduction of miR-153 methylation level, re-expression of candidate microRNA, and downregulation of its target proteins levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that miR-153 acts as a tumor suppressor in GBM and is down-regulated by DNA methylation, suggesting that miR-153 may serve as a potential diagnostic or therapeutic target of GBM.

A total of 56 lupus patients (28 with renal involvement and 28 without renal involvement), and 56 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls were included in our study. We identified 191 CG sites and 121 genes that were only differentially methylated in lupus patients with but not without a history of renal involvement. The tyrosine kinase gene TNK2 involved in cell trafficking and tissue invasion, and the phosphatase gene DUSP5 which dephosphorylates and inhibits the ERK signaling pathway, were among the most hypomethylated. Independent of disease activity, renal involvement is characterized by more robust demethylation in interferon regulated genes differentially methylated in both sets of lupus patients with and without renal involvement (fold change 1.4, P = 0.0014). The type-I interferon master regulator gene IRF7 is only hypomethylated in lupus patients with renal involvement.

DNA methylation has been related to smoking, but genome-wide methylation data for smoking in Chinese populations is limited. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate epigenome-wide methylation in relation to smoking in a Chinese population. METHODS: We measured the methylation levels at > 485,000 CpG sites (CpGs) in DNA from leukocytes using a methylation array and conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of DNA methylation and smoking in a total of 596 Chinese participants. We further evaluated the associations of smoking-related CpGs with internal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biomarkers and their correlations with the expression of corresponding genes. RESULTS: We identified 318 CpGs whose methylation levels were associated with smoking at a genome-wide significance level (false discovery rate < 0.05), among which 161 CpGs annotated to 123 genes were not associated with smoking in recent studies of Europeans and African Americans. Of these smoking-related CpGs, methylation levels at 80 CpGs showed significant correlations with the expression of corresponding genes (including RUNX3, IL6R, PTAFR, ANKRD11, CEP135 and CDH23), and methylation at 15 CpGs was significantly associated with urinary 2-hydroxynaphthalene, the most representative internal monohydroxy-PAH biomarker for smoking. CONCLUSION: We identified DNA methylation markers associated with smoking in a Chinese population, including some markers that were also correlated with gene expression.

The average age was 43.1 +/-12.2 years and 73% were on SGAs. Average% global methylation was 77.0 +/- 3.26 and was significantly influenced by insulin resistance, SGA use and smoking. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show a relationship between SGA use, insulin resistance and global DNA methylation. Further work will be needed to identify tissue- and gene-specific methylation changes.",4.649,776

DESIGN: In vitro experiments using murine model. SETTING: State key laboratory and university research laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Kunming white mice. INTERVENTION(S): The mouse metaphase II oocytes were vitrified. After thawing, the surviving oocytes were fertilized in vitro to produce blastocysts. The blastocysts derived in vitro from fresh oocytes were used as a control. The DNA methylation patterns of the DMRs of imprinted genes in oocytes and blastocysts and the relative expression of DNMTs (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3l) in oocytes and blastocysts were detected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Methylation patterns of DMRs of H19, Peg3, and Snrpn analyzed by bisulfite mutagenesis and sequencing. Expression levels of messenger ribonucleic acid as measured by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULT(S): After oocytes vitrification, the methylation levels at H19, Peg3, and Snrpn DMRs in blastocysts were decreased. However, there was no significant difference in the percentage of hypermethylated strands at Peg3 DMRs between the vitrified and control groups. DNMTs expression in vitrified oocytes and the expression of Dnmt3b in blastocysts derived from vitrified oocytes were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION(S): Oocytes vitrification could lead to the loss of DNA methylation of imprinted genes (H19, Peg3, and Snrpn) in mouse blastocysts, which is mainly caused by the reductions of DNMTs after vitrification of oocytes.",4.59,1721

In this study, we aimed to study DNA methylation status and mRNA expression patterns of Foxl2 and cyp19a1a genes during ovarian development of female Japanese flounder. The relative expression level of cyp19a1a and Foxl2 gene during the gonadal development stages was measured by quantitative PCR. Moreover, DNA methylation status in the promoter and coding regions of the two genes was detected by bisulfite sequencing. The estradiol-17beta (E2) was measured by radioimmunoassay. The results showed low expression levels of cyp19a1a and Foxl2 genes in stages II and V, while the highest expression levels were detected in stage IV. The variation trend of the methylation level of all CpG sites in promoter and exon 1 of cyp19a1a gene and three CpG rich regions in coding region of Foxl2 gene was negatively associated with their expression levels during the ovarian development. In addition, two CpG sites in promoter and seven CpG sites in exon 1 of cyp19a1a were on the putative transcription factors binding sequence. Further studies showed that the forkhead domain, which is important for Foxl2 binding to cyp19a1a was located in the F1 and F2 region. These results provide a powerful theoretical basis for the regulatory mechanism on Foxl2 regulating cyp19a1a and promoting gonadal differentiation towards the female pathway, and further reveal that Foxl2 and cyp19a1a play a vital role in the female Japanese flounder gonad development.",2.138,603

However, it is unknown to what extent this modulation is achieved through DNA methylation. We assessed the effects of cholesterol intake, the proportion of energy intake derived from fat, the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to saturated fatty acids (SFA), the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to SFA, and the ratio of MUFA+PUFA to SFA on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in normal-weight and obese children. We determined the genome-wide methylation profile in the blood of 69 Greek preadolescents ( approximately 10 years old) as well as their dietary intake for two consecutive weekdays and one weekend day. The methylation levels of one CpG island shore and four sites were significantly correlated with total fat intake. The methylation levels of 2 islands, 11 island shores and 16 sites were significantly correlated with PUFA/SFA; of 9 islands, 26 island shores and 158 sites with MUFA/SFA; and of 10 islands, 40 island shores and 130 sites with (MUFA+PUFA)/SFA. We found significant gene enrichment in 34 pathways for PUFA/SFA, including the leptin pathway, and a significant enrichment in 5 pathways for (MUFA+PUFA)/SFA.

We investigated gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)-related differential DNA methylation in early pregnancy peripheral blood samples collected from women who had a change in GDM status in repeat pregnancies. Six study participants were randomly selected from among women who had 2 consecutive pregnancies, only 1 of which was complicated by GDM (case pregnancy) and the other was not (control pregnancy). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was profiled using Illumina HumanMethylation 27 BeadChips. Differential Identification using Mixture Ensemble and false discovery rate (<10%) cutoffs were used to identify differentially methylated targets between the 2 pregnancies of each participant. Overall, 27 target sites, 17 hypomethylated (fold change [FC] range: 0.77-0.99) and 10 hypermethylated (FC range: 1.01-1.09), were differentially methylated between GDM and control pregnancies among 5 or more study participants. Novel genes were related to identified hypomethylated (such as NDUFC1, HAPLN3, HHLA3, and RHOG) or hypermethylated sites (such as SEP11, ZAR1, and DDR). Genes related to identified sites participated in cell morphology, cellular assembly, cellular organization, cellular compromise, and cell cycle. Our findings support early pregnancy peripheral blood DNA methylation differences in repeat pregnancies with change in GDM status.

In addition, various genes are also found to respond to UV radiation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the sun exposure influence on the DNA methylation profile on the matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP9), microRNA 137 (miR-137), cytokeratin 14 (KRT14) and 19 (KRT19) genes of skin cells of subjects with no history of skin diseases. METHODS: Skin biopsies (5mm) were obtained using a punch technique on sun-exposed (outer forearm) and sun-protected areas (inner arm) from 30 corpses from the Brazilian Service of Death Investigation. Skin types were ranked according to Fitzpatrick's criteria. Genomic DNA was extracted and a DNA methylation analysis was performed using Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) or Methylation-Sensitive Restriction Enzymes (MSRE) of sun-exposed and sun-protected skin areas. RESULTS: No differences were found among the areas (p>0.05; McNemar), with the partially methylated condition found to be a common event in skin for both MMP9 and miR-137 genes and the methylated condition for both KRT14 and KRT19 genes. Additional analysis showed no differences in the methylation status when age, gender and skin type were considered, however, the methylation status of miR-137 gene seems to be gender-related.

Hypoxia has been shown to alter DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism involved in regulating gene expression such as the pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 and the anti-fibrotic Ras protein activator like 1 (RASAL1). The purpose of this study was to compare DNA methylation levels, and the expression of TGFbeta1 and RASAL1 in primary human normal (NTM) with glaucomatous (GTM) cells and in NTM cells under hypoxic conditions. METHODS: Global DNA methylation was assessed by ELISA in cultured age-matched NTM and GTM cells. qPCR was conducted for TGFbeta1, collagen 1alpha1 (COL1A1), and RASAL1 expression. Western immunoblotting was used to determine protein expression. For hypoxia experiments, NTM cells were cultured in a 1%O2, 5%CO2 and 37 degrees C environment. NTM and GTM cells were treated with TGFbeta1 (10ng/ml) and the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-aza) (0.5muM) respectively to determine their effects on DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and RASAL1 expression. RESULTS: We found increased DNA methylation, increased TGFbeta1 expression and decreased RASAL1 expression in GTM cells compared to NTM cells. Similar results were obtained in NTM cells under hypoxic conditions. TGFbeta1 treatment increased DNMT1 and COL1A1, and decreased RASAL1 expression in NTM cells. 5-aza treatment decreased DNMT1, TGFbeta1 and COL1A1 expression, and increased RASAL1 expression in GTM cells. CONCLUSIONS: TGFbeta1 and RASAL1 expression, global DNA methylation, and expression of associated methylation enzymes were altered between NTM and GTM cells. We found that hypoxia in NTM cells induced similar results to the GTM cells. Furthermore, DNA methylation, TGFbeta1 and RASAL1 appear to have an interacting relationship that may play a role in driving pro-fibrotic disease progression in the glaucomatous TM.",3.234,1739

Here, we report the examination of DNA methylation status of DTNBP1 promoter region, one of the most credible candidate genes affected in SCZ, assayed in saliva and post-mortem brain samples. The Illumina DNA methylation profiling and bisulfite sequencing of representative samples were used to identify methylation status of the DTNBP1 promoter region. Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was employed to assess methylation of DTNBP1 promoter CpGs flanking a SP1 binding site in the saliva of SCZ patients, their first-degree relatives and control subjects (30, 15, and 30/group, respectively) as well as in post-mortem brains of patients with SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD) versus controls (35/group). qRT-PCR was used to assess DTNBP1 expression. We found DNA hypermethylation of DTNBP1 promoter in the saliva of SCZ patients ( approximately 12.5%, P = 0.036), particularly in drug-naive patients ( approximately 20%, P = 0.011), and a trend toward hypermethylation in their first-degree relatives (P = 0.085) versus controls. Analysis of post-mortem brain samples revealed an inverse correlation between DTNBP1 methylation and expression, and normalization of this epigenetic change by classic antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, BD patients with psychotic depression exhibited higher degree of methylation versus other BD patients ( approximately 80%, P = 0.025).

Our study focused on the genomic region of 1,000 bp, which includes the final part of 680 bp of the Dpp4 gene promoter and a small stretch of 320 bp at the beginning of the gene. The results indicate that the different immunohistochemical pattern of DPP4 observed in obese (fa/fa) and lean (fa/-) Zucker rats is not correlated to DNA methylation of its promoter.

These therapies inhibit the action of negative regulators of osteoblastic Wnt signaling. The report that Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) was epigenetically silenced via promoter DNA methylation in osteosarcoma (OS) raised potential concerns for such treatment approaches. Here we confirm that Wif1 expression is frequently reduced in OS. However, we demonstrate that silencing is not driven by DNA methylation. Treatment of mouse and human OS cells showed that Wif1 expression was robustly induced by HDAC inhibition but not by methylation inhibition. Consistent with HDAC dependent silencing, the Wif1 locus in OS was characterized by low acetylation levels and a bivalent H3K4/H3K27-trimethylation state. Wif1 expression marked late stages of normal osteoblast maturation and stratified OS tumors based on differentiation stage across species. Culture of OS cells under differentiation inductive conditions increased expression of Wif1. Together these results demonstrate that Wif1 is not targeted for silencing by DNA methylation in OS. Instead, the reduced expression of Wif1 in OS cells is in context with their stage in differentiation.",3.973,1236

The objective of this study was to identify genes regulated by methylation during normal septation in mice and during disordered septation in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In mice, newborn lungs (preseptation) and adult lungs (postseptation) were evaluated by microarray analysis of gene expression and immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). In humans, microarray gene expression data were integrated with genome-wide DNA methylation data from bronchopulmonary dysplasia versus preterm and term lung. Genes with reciprocal changes in expression and methylation, suggesting regulation by DNA methylation, were identified. In mice, 95 genes with inverse correlation between expression and methylation during normal septation were identified. In addition to genes known to be important in lung development (Wnt signaling, Angpt2, Sox9, etc.) and its extracellular matrix (Tnc, Eln, etc.), genes involved with immune and antioxidant defense (Stat4, Sod3, Prdx6, etc.) were also observed. In humans, 23 genes were differentially methylated with reciprocal changes in expression in bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with preterm or term lung. Genes of interest included those involved with detoxifying enzymes (Gstm3) and transforming growth factor-beta signaling (bone morphogenetic protein 7 [Bmp7]). In terms of overlap, 20 genes and three pathways methylated during mouse lung development also demonstrated changes in methylation between preterm and term human lung. Changes in methylation correspond to altered expression of a number of genes associated with lung development, suggesting that DNA methylation of these genes may regulate normal and abnormal alveolar septation.",3.985,451

We aimed to study the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of skin cancers induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-1,3-acetate (TPA). MAIN METHODS: Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) followed by next-generation sequencing was utilized to ascertain the DNA methylation profiles in the following common mouse skin cancer models: SKH-1 mice treated with UVB irradiation and CD-1 mice treated with DMBA/TPA. Ingenuity(R) Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was utilized to analyze the data and to identify gene interactions among the different pathways. KEY FINDINGS: 6003 genes in the UVB group and 5424 genes in the DMBA/TPA group exhibited a greater than 2-fold change in CpG methylation as mapped by the IPA software. The top canonical pathways identified by IPA after the two treatments were ranked were pathways related to cancer development, cAMP-mediated signaling, G protein-coupled receptor signaling and PTEN signaling associated with UVB treatment, whereas protein kinase A signaling and xenobiotic metabolism signaling were associated with DMBA/TPA treatment. In addition, the mapped IL-6-related inflammatory pathways displayed alterations in the methylation profiles of inflammation-related genes linked to UVB treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Genes with altered methylation were ranked in the UVB and DMBA/TPA models, and the molecular interaction networks of those genes were identified by the IPA software.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to investigate the correlation between TCF21 methylation levels and clinical parameters (gender, age, smoking history, Fuhrman grade and clinical stage). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to evaluate the accuracy of predictive diagnosis of RCC. TCF21 methylation levels were significantly increased in RCC samples compared with normal renal tissues and urine samples.

NPC1L1 is differentially expressed along the gastrointestinal tract with very low levels in the colon as compared with the small intestine. This study was undertaken to examine whether DNA methylation was responsible for segment-specific expression of NPC1L1. Treatment of mice with 5-azacytidine (i.p.) resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in NPC1L1 mRNA expression in the colon. The lack of expression of NPC1L1 in the normal colon was associated with high levels of methylation in the area flanking the 3-kb fragment upstream of the initiation site of the mouse NPC1L1 gene in mouse colon as analyzed by EpiTYPER(R) MassARRAY(R). The high level of methylation in the colon was observed in specific CpG dinucleotides and was significantly decreased in response to 5-azacytidine. Similar to mouse NPC1L1, 5-azacytidine treatment also increased the level of human NPC1L1 mRNA expression in the intestinal HuTu-80 cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Silencing the expression of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, -2, -3A, and -3B alone by siRNA did not affect NPC1L1 expression in HuTu-80 cells. However, the simultaneous attenuation of DNMT1 and -3B expression caused a significant increase in NPC1L1 mRNA expression as compared with control. Also, in vitro methylation of the human NPC1L1 promoter significantly decreased NPC1L1 promoter activity in human intestinal Caco2 cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated for the first time that DNA methylation in the promoter region of the NPC1L1 gene appears to be a major mechanism underlying differential expression of NPC1L1 along the length of the gastrointestinal tract.",0,1578

The methylome is therefore proposed to be a biomarker of health through age. ANGPTL2 is a circulating pro-inflammatory protein that increases with age and prematurely in patients with coronary artery diseases; integrating the methylation pattern of the promoter may help differentiate age- vs. disease-related change in its expression. We believe that in a pro-inflammatory environment, ANGPTL2 is differentially methylated, regulating ANGPTL2 expression. To test this hypothesis we investigated the changes in promoter methylation of ANGPTL2 gene in leukocytes from patients suffering from post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS). DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes of post-ACS patients with cardiovascular risk factors and from healthy young and age-matched controls. Methylation sites (CpGs) found in the ANGPTL2 gene were targeted for specific DNA methylation quantification. The functionality of ANGPTL2 methylation was assessed by an in vitro luciferase assay. In post-ACS patients, C-reactive protein and ANGPTL2 circulating levels increased significantly when compared to healthy controls. Decreased methylation of specific CpGs were found in the promoter of ANGPTL2 and allowed to discriminate age vs. disease associated methylation. In vitro DNA methylation of specific CpG lead to inhibition of ANGPTL2 promoter activity. Reduced leukocyte DNA methylation in the promoter region of ANGPTL2 is associated with the pro-inflammatory environment that characterizes patients with post-ACS differently from age-matched healthy controls. Methylation of different CpGs in ANGPTL2 gene may prove to be a reliable biomarker of coronary disease.",3.234,1779

Gross total resection is treatment of choice, but not easily achieved; hence, alkylating agents like temozolomide (TMZ) are now being tried. O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has proven prognostic and predictive value in glioblastomas. This study evaluates MGMT promoter methylation in meningeal HPCs to determine its role in HPC oncogenesis and its association with patient outcome. Meningeal HPCs diagnosed between 2002 and 2011 were retrieved and clinicopathological features reviewed. MGMT promoter methylation status was assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MGMT protein. HPCs accounted for 1.1% of all CNS tumors. Forty cases were analyzed; the majority were adults (mean age = 41.4 years). Seventy percent were primary and 30% were recurrent tumors; 60% were grade II and 40% were grade III. MGMT promoter methylation was identified in 45% of cases, including Grade II (54.2%) and Grade III (31.3%) (P = 0.203). Promoter methylation was significantly (P = 0.035) more frequent in primary (57.1%) than in recurrent (16.7%) tumors. No correlation was noted between MGMT promoter methylation by MSP and MGMT protein expression by IHC, or with progression-free survival. Thus, a significant proportion of HPCs demonstrate MGMT promoter methylation, suggesting possible susceptibility to TMZ. As promoter methylation is more frequent in primary tumors, TMZ may serve as a therapeutic option in residual primary tumors. Epigenetic inactivation of MGMT in HPCs necessitates the assessment of prognostic and predictive value of MGMT promoter methylation in HPCs in larger clinical trials.",0,1582

We collect 39 previously published DNA methylation profiles using an Illumina(R) HumanMethylation 27 BeadChip Kit containing 22 common tissues and involving 27,578 CpG loci across the human genome. We found 86 positions of tissue specific methylation CpG (TSM) that encompass 34 hypermethylated TSMs (31 genes) and 52 hypomethylated TSMs (47 genes). Tissues were found to contain 1 to 25 TSM loci, with the majority in the liver (25), testis (18), and brain (16). Fewer TSM loci were found in the muscle (8), ovary (7), adrenal gland (3), pancreas (2-4), kidney, spleen, and stomach (1 each). TSMs are predominantly located 0-300 base pairs in the 3' direction after the transcription start site. Similar to known promoters of methylation, hypermethylated TSM genes suppress transcription, while hypomethylated TSMs allow gene transcription. The majority of hypermethylated TSM genes encode membrane proteins and receptors, while hypomethylated TSM genes primarily encode signal peptides and tissue-specific proteins. In summary, the database of TSM loci produced herein is useful for the selection of tissue-specific DNA markers as diagnostic tools, as well as for the further study of the mechanisms and roles of TSM.",2.138,947

Aberrant regulation of gene expression is associated with behavioral abnormalities, where DNA methylation bridges environmental signals to sustained changes in gene expression. We assessed DNA methylation changes in the brains of rats exposed to three 74.5 kPa blast overpressure events, conditions that have been associated with long-term anxiogenic manifestations weeks or months following the initial exposures. Rat frontal cortex eight months post-exposure was used for cell sorting of whole brain tissue into neurons and glia. We interrogated DNA methylation profiles in these cells using Expanded Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. We obtained data for millions of cytosines, showing distinct methylation profiles for neurons and glia and an increase in global methylation in neuronal versus glial cells (p<10(-7)). We detected DNA methylation perturbations in blast overpressure-exposed animals, compared with sham blast controls, within 458 and 379 genes in neurons and glia, respectively. Differentially methylated neuronal genes showed enrichment in cell death and survival and nervous system development and function, including genes involved in transforming growth factor beta and nitric oxide signaling. Functional validation via gene expression analysis of 30 differentially methylated neuronal and glial genes showed a 1.2 fold change in gene expression of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase gene (Aanat) in blast animals (p<0.05). These data provide the first genome-based evidence for changes in DNA methylation induced in response to multiple blast overpressure exposures. In particular, increased methylation and decreased gene expression were observed in the Aanat gene, which is involved in converting serotonin to the circadian hormone melatonin and is implicated in sleep disturbance and depression associated with traumatic brain injury.",3.714,242
25239471,Global loss of DNA methylation uncovers intronic enhancers in genes showing expression changes.,[],Genome biology,2014,"BACKGROUND: Gene expression is epigenetically regulated by a combination of histone modifications and methylation of CpG dinucleotides in promoters. In normal cells, CpG-rich promoters are typically unmethylated, marked with histone modifications such as H3K4me3, and are highly active. During neoplastic transformation, CpG dinucleotides of CG-rich promoters become aberrantly methylated, corresponding with the removal of active histone modifications and transcriptional silencing. Outside of promoter regions, distal enhancers play a major role in the cell type-specific regulation of gene expression. Enhancers, which function by bringing activating complexes to promoters through chromosomal looping, are also modulated by a combination of DNA methylation and histone modifications. RESULTS: Here we use HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with and without mutations in DNA methyltransferases, the latter of which results in a 95% reduction in global DNA methylation levels. These cells are used to study the relationship between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene expression. We find that the loss of DNA methylation is not sufficient to reactivate most of the silenced promoters. In contrast, the removal of DNA methylation results in the activation of a large number of enhancer regions as determined by the acquisition of active histone marks. CONCLUSIONS: Although the transcriptome is largely unaffected by the loss of DNA methylation, we identify two distinct mechanisms resulting in the upregulation of distinct sets of genes. One is a direct result of DNA methylation loss at a set of promoter regions and the other is due to the presence of new intragenic enhancers.",10.81,1891

HIV has shown the ability to interact with host cellular factors to change the methylation status of some genes [2], [3], [4]. However, the change of the DNA methylation associated with HIV infection based on the whole genome has not been well illustrated. In this study, a unique pair of monozygotic twins was recruited: one of the twins was infected with HIV without further anti-retroviral therapy while the other one was healthy, which could be considered as a relatively ideal model for profiling the alterations of DNA methylation associated with HIV infection. Therefore, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-microarray method (MeDIP-microarray), we found the increased DNA methylation level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV infected twin compared to her normal sibling. Moreover, several distinguished differential methylation regions (DMRs) in HIV infected twin worth further study.

Here we show using metabolomics that CO-sensitive methylation of PFKFB3, an enzyme producing fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), serves as a switch to activate phosphofructokinase-1, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme. In human leukaemia U937 cells, PFKFB3 is asymmetrically di-methylated at R131 and R134 through modification by protein arginine methyltransferase 1. HO-1 induction or CO results in reduced methylation of PFKFB3 in varied cancer cells to suppress F-2,6-BP, shifting glucose utilization from glycolysis toward the pentose phosphate pathway. Loss of PFKFB3 methylation depends on the inhibitory effects of CO on haem-containing cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). CBS modulates remethylation metabolism, and increases NADPH to supply reduced glutathione, protecting cells from oxidative stress and anti-cancer reagents. Once the methylation of PFKFB3 is reduced, the protein undergoes polyubiquitination and is degraded in the proteasome. These results suggest that the CO/CBS-dependent regulation of PFKFB3 methylation determines directional glucose utilization to ensure resistance against oxidative stress for cancer cell survival.",11.47,1819

Thus, myriad technologies for the analysis of DNA methylation have been developed over the past few decades. However, most of these technologies are still far from ideal because they are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and complex, and there is the risk of contamination of samples. Here, we present an innovative DNA methylation-specific amplification/detection device for analysis of DNA methylation in cancer-related DNA biomarkers. The assay is based on a microfluidic system that is coupled to a flexible plastic-based on-chip endonuclease digestion device with optimized magnetic field effect and a methylation-specific isothermal solid-phase amplification/detection technique to allow a low-cost, simple, and rapid analysis of DNA methylation status in a label-free and real-time manner. This flexible plastic/silicon-based microfluidic device is relatively simple to fabricate with a flexible thin film and a magnet array by using a laser machine that can overcome the limitations of a PDMS-based microfluidic device. We demonstrated the ability of the methylation analysis based on the proposed flexible device to detect the methylated RARbeta gene, which is a common DNA methylation biomarker in several human cancers. The simple platform detected the methylated gene in genomic DNA from human cancer cell lines within 65 min, whereas other methods required at least several hours. Therefore, this simple, low-cost, and rapid methylation analysis platform will be useful for the detection of DNA methylation in point-of-care applications.",6.115,1538

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected pregnancy outcome data from pregnant women, cord blood samples at delivery, and blood from children (7-9 years old; n = 90) through a prospective cohort study at Ewha Womans University, MokDong Hospital (Seoul, Korea), from 2003-2005. POMC methylation was assessed by pyrosequencing. We divided subjects into three groups according to cord blood POMC methylation: the low methylation (<10th percentile), mid-methylation, and high methylation (>90th percentile) groups. We analyzed the association of POMC methylation status at birth with adiposity and metabolic components using ANCOVA and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Birth weights (P = 0.01) and ponderal indices (P = 0.01) in the high POMC methylation group were significantly lower than in the mid-POMC methylation group. In terms of metabolic components of childhood, blood triglycerides (57.97, 67.29 vs. 113.89 mg/dL; P = 0.03, 0.01) and insulin (7.10, 7.64 vs. 10.13 muIU/mL; P = 0.05, 0.02) at childhood were significantly higher in the high POMC methylation group than in the low and mid-POMC methylation group. CONCLUSIONS: High POMC methylation in cord blood was associated with lower birth weight, and children with high POMC methylation in cord blood showed higher triglycerides and higher insulin concentrations in blood. Thus, POMC methylation status in cord blood may be an early predictive marker of future metabolic syndrome.",8.42,1358

In the presented protocol, we present a method for the analysis of DNA methylation patterns on both alleles separately using heterozygous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as anchor for allele-specific PCR amplification followed by analysis of the allele-specific DNA methylation patterns by Pyrosequencing((R)). Pyrosequencing is an easy-to-handle, quantitative real-time sequencing method that is frequently used for genotyping as well as for the analysis of DNA methylation patterns. The protocol consists of three major steps: (1) identification of individuals heterozygous for a SNP in a region of interest using Pyrosequencing; (2) analysis of the DNA methylation patterns surrounding the SNP on bisulfite-treated DNA to identify regions of potential allele-specific DNA methylation; and (3) the analysis of the DNA methylation patterns associated with each of the two alleles, which are individually amplified using allele-specific PCR. The enrichment of the targeted allele is re-enforced by modification of the allele-specific primers at the allele-discriminating base with Locked Nucleic Acids (LNA). For the proof-of-principle of the developed approach, we provide assay details for three imprinted genes (IGF2, IGF2R, and PEG3) within this chapter. The mean of the DNA methylation patterns derived from the individual alleles corresponds well to the overall DNA methylation patterns and the developed approach proved more reliable compared to other protocols for allele-specific DNA methylation analysis.",0,1155

Epigenetic modification of gene function is considered one possible mechanism by which PNMS results in poor outcomes in offspring. Our goal was to determine the role of maternal objective exposure and subjective distress on child BMI and central adiposity at 13(1/2) years of age, and to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation mediates the effect of PNMS on growth. Mothers were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec ice storm. We assessed their objective exposure and subjective distress in June 1998. At age 13(1/2) their children were weighed and measured (n = 66); a subsample provided blood samples for epigenetic studies (n = 31). Objective and subjective PNMS correlated with central adiposity (waist-to-height ratio); only objective PNMS predicted body mass index (BMI). Bootstrapping analyses showed that the methylation level of genes from established Type-1 and -2 diabetes mellitus pathways showed significant mediation of the effect of objective PNMS on both central adiposity and BMI. However, the negative mediating effects indicate that, although greater objective PNMS predicts greater BMI and adiposity, this effect is dampened by the effects of objective PNMS on DNA methylation, suggesting a protective role of the selected genes from Type-1 and -2 diabetes mellitus pathways. We provide data supporting that DNA methylation is a potential mechanism involved in the long-term adaptation and programming of the genome in response to early adverse environmental factors.",4.78,1769

So far, the principal treatment to KD is the administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Although DNA methylation plays important regulation roles in diseases, few studies investigated the regulation roles of DNA methylation in KD. METHODS: In this study, we focused not only on the DNA methylation alterations resulted from KD onset but also on DNA methylation alterations resulted from IVIG administration. To do so, we investigated the effects of KD's onset and IVIG administration on CpG marker's methylation alterations. RESULTS: We first found that DNA methylation alterations reflecting disease onset or IVIG administration are contributed mainly by the CpG markers on autosomes. In addition, we also demonstrated that some CpG markers carry methylation alteration among samples, forcing the expression abundance of the downstream genes to be also altered and negatively correlated with methylation profile. Finally, compared with KD's onset, IVIG administration brings stronger impact on methylation alteration. And, such alterations were conducted mainly by hyper-methylating CpG markers, forcing the corresponding genes to keep lower expression levels. Moreover, the genes regulated by the altered CpG markers with IVIG administration are enriched in the pathways associated with inflammatory immune response. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our result provides researchers with another way into the regulation mechanism through which IVIG represses excessive inflammatory responses.",2.873,420

To study the role of DNA methylation in the active modulation of TF binding, we quantified the effect of DNA methylation depletion on the genomic occupancy patterns of CTCF, an abundant TF with known methylation sensitivity that is capable of autonomous binding to its target sites in chromatin. Here, we show that the vast majority (>98.5%) of the tens of thousands of unoccupied, methylated CTCF recognition sequences remain unbound upon abrogation of DNA methylation. The small fraction of sites that show methylation-dependent binding in vivo are in turn characterized by highly variable CTCF occupancy across cell types. Our results suggest that DNA methylation is not a primary groundskeeper of genomic TF landscapes, but rather a specialized mechanism for stabilizing intrinsically labile sites.",8.358,366

The predispositions to either major depression or suicide are thought to depend on genetic risk factors or epigenetic effects. We investigated DNA methylation signatures postmortem in brains of suicides with diagnosis of major depressive disorder. DNA methylation levels were determined at single C-phosphate-G (CpG) resolution sites within ventral prefrontal cortex of 53 suicides and nonpsychiatric controls, aged 16 to 89 years. We found that DNA methylation increases throughout the lifespan. Suicides showed an 8-fold greater number of methylated CpG sites relative to controls (P < 2.2 x 10(-16)), with greater DNA methylation changes over and above the increased methylation observed in normal aging. This increased DNA methylation may be a significant contributor to the neuropathology and psychopathology underlying the risk of suicide in depression.",0,1480

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Academic research hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The methylation status of 23 genes in 50 ITACs and 32 SNSCCs was analyzed by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and its relation to clinicopathologic features and follow-up data. RESULTS: Gene methylation was observed in 50% of all tumors. Recurrent methylated genes in SNSCC were RASSF1 and CDH13 (for both, 6 of 32 cases), CHFR (4 of 32 cases), and TIMP3 (2 of 32 cases). None of these genes showed significant correlation to clinicopathologic features or overall survival. In ITAC, recurrent methylated genes were CDH13 (18 of 50 cases), ESR1 (13 of 50 cases), APC (7 of 50 cases), TIMP3 (5 of 50 cases), CASP8 (3 of 50 cases), and HIC1 and RASSF1 (for both, 2 of 50 cases). Papillary and colonic ITAC subtypes carried a mean of 1.26 gene methylations per tumor versus 0.63 in solid and mucinous subtypes. Methylation of TIMP3 was associated with a significantly worse survival in ITAC patients. CONCLUSION: ITAC carries a higher number and a different profile of gene methylations as compared with SNSCC. Gene methylation plays a greater role in papillary and colonic ITAC subtypes, which may indicate a different tumorigenic pathway for these ITAC subtypes. These findings could be used as prognosticators and may have implications for future individualized therapies based on epigenetic changes.",2.02,1674

For each CpG probe, epimutated subjects were identified as the extreme outliers with methylation level exceeding three times interquartile ranges the first quartile (Q1-(3 x IQR)) or the third quartile (Q3+(3 x IQR)). We demonstrated that the number of SEMs was low in childhood and increased exponentially during aging. Using the HUMARA method, skewing of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) was evaluated in heterozygotes women. Multivariate analysis indicated a significant correlation between log(SEMs) and degree of XCI skewing after adjustment for age (beta = 0.41; confidence interval: 0.14, 0.68; p-value = 0.0053). The PATH analysis tested the complete model containing the variables: skewing of XCI, age, log(SEMs) and overall CpG methylation. After adjusting for the number of epimutations we failed to confirm the well reported correlation between skewing of XCI and aging. This evidence might suggest that the known correlation between XCI skewing and aging could not be a direct association but mediated by the number of SEMs.",2.0,1290

CRCs with 4/8 methylated markers were closer to CRCs with 5/8 to 8/8 methylated markers in terms of sex distribution, mucin production, serration, nodal metastasis, CK7 expression, CK20 loss, and CDX2 loss frequencies and overall survival rate. CRCs with methylation at 4/8 markers were closer to CRCs with 1/8 to 3/8 methylated markers in terms of less frequent right colon location and poor differentiation.

The rs144383 C to T SNP located in the 5'UTR of this gene is functional and has a pleiotropic effect on the musculoskeletal system, being a risk factor for knee-osteoarthritis (OA), congenital hip dysplasia, lumbar disc degeneration and Achilles tendon pathology. rs143383 exerts a joint-wide effect on GDF5 expression, with expression of the OA-associated T allele being significantly reduced relative to the C allele, termed allelic expression imbalance. We have previously reported that the GDF5 locus is subject to DNA methylation and that allelic imbalance of rs143383 is mediated by SP1, SP3 and DEAF1 transcriptional repressors. In this study, we have assayed GDF5 methylation in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage, and investigated the effect of methylation on the allelic imbalance of rs143383. We observed demethylation of the GDF5 5'UTR in OA knee cartilage relative to both OA (p = 0.009) and non-OA (p = 0.001) hip cartilage, with the most significant demethylation observed at the highly conserved +37 CpG site located 4 bp upstream of rs143383. Methylation modulates the level and direction of allelic imbalance of rs143383, with methylation of the +37 CpG dinucleotide within the SP1/SP3 binding site having an allele-specific effect on SP1 and SP3 binding. Furthermore, methylation attenuated the repressive effects of SP1, SP3 and DEAF1 on GDF5 promoter activity. This data suggest that the differential methylation of the +37 CpG site between osteoarthritic hip and knee cartilage may be responsible for the knee-specific effect of rs143383 on OA susceptibility.",4.824,1998

A recent paper examining changes in diet and sperm cytosine methylation from pools of eight animals each, found differences between a normal diet, a high fat diet, and a low protein diet. However, epivariation between individuals within a group was greater than the differences between groups obscuring any potential methylation changes linked to diet. Learning more about epivariation may help unravel the mechanisms that regulate cytosine methylation.

Here we showed that global DNA methylation level in mouse livers displayed a daily variation where the peak phases occurred during the end of the day and the lowest level at the beginning of the day in the light-dark or dark-dark cycles. Typical repeat sequence long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) had a similar methylation rhythm to global DNA. DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) brought a relative forward daily variation to global DNA methylation, and the temporary change in ratio of SAM to SAH had no influence on the DNA methylation level. The rhythm of global DNA methylation was lost and DNA methylation level was increased in Per1-/-Per2-/- double knockout mice, which were in accordance with changes of Dnmt3a mRNA levels and its rhythm. Our results suggest that the daily variation in global DNA methylation was associated with the change of Dnmt3a expression rather than ratio of SAM to SAH.",3.234,1171

However, although LCL DNA has proved valuable for genetic studies, its utility in epigenetic epidemiology research is unknown. METHODS: To assess whether LCL DNA can be used for life-course environmental epigenomics, we carried out a pilot methylomic study (using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip) of nil-passage, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed LCLs (n = 42) and 28 matched whole-blood (WB) samples. These were from adult male participants of the British 1958 birth cohort, selected for extremes of social economic position (SEP) in childhood and adulthood, with additional information available on childhood abuse and prenatal tobacco exposure. RESULTS: We identified a small number of weak associations between these exposures and methylation levels of both individual CpG sites and genomic regions in WB and LCLs. However, only one of the regional, and none of the individual CpG site associations were common to both sample types. The lack of overlap between the associations detected in LCL compared with those found in WB could either be due to the EBV-transformation process, or to the fact that, unlike WB, LCLs are essentially a single (CD19+) cell type. We provide evidence that the latter is the more potent explanation, by showing that CpG sites known to be differentially methylated between different types of blood cell have significantly lower correlations (R = 0.11) than average (R = 0.2) between WB and LCLs in our datasets, whereas sites known to be affected by EBV-transformation have significantly higher correlations (R = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: This small pilot study suggests that the DNA methylation profile of LCLs is more closely related to that of B cells than WB and, additionally, that LCLs may nevertheless be useful for life-course environmental epigenomics.",9.176,1289
26232681,Blast induced neurotrauma causes overpressure dependent changes to the DNA methylation equilibrium.,"['Bailey ZS', 'Grinter MB', 'De La Torre Campos D', 'VandeVord PJ']",Neuroscience letters,2015,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a high prevalence in our society and often leads to morbidity and mortality. TBI also occurs frequently in a military setting where exposure to blast waves is common. Abnormal gene expression involved with oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal apoptosis has been well documented following blast induced neurotrauma (BINT). Altered epigenetic transcriptional regulation through DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathology of the injury. Imbalance between DNA methylation and DNA demethylation may lead to altered methylation patterns and subsequent changes in gene transcription. DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) are responsible for the addition of methyl groups to DNA, DNA methylation. Whereas the combined function of ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3) and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) result in the removal of methyl groups from DNA, DNA demethylation. We used an established rodent model of BINT to assess changes in DNA methylation and demethylation enzymes following injury. Three different blast overpressures were investigated (10, 17 and 23psi). Gene expression was investigated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus two weeks following injury. We observed DNMT, TET and TDG expression changes between pressure groups and brain regions. The hippocampus was more vulnerable to enzyme expression changes than the prefrontal cortex, which correlated with aberrant DNA methylation. A significant negative correlation was found between global DNA methylation and the magnitude of blast overpressure exposure. Through transcriptional regulation, altered DNA methylation patterns may offer insight into the characteristic outcomes associated with the injury pathology including inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. As such, these enzymes may be important targets to future therapeutic intervention strategies.",2.03,199

NSC amplification in vitro is a necessary step towards using NSC transplantation therapy to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Folic acid (FA) has been shown to act through DNA methyltransferase to stimulate NSC proliferation. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, the effect of FA on the methylation profiles in neonatal rat NSCs was assessed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-DNA microarray (MeDIP-Chip). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined by quantitative differentially methylated regions analysis, and genes carrying at least three DMRs were selected for pathway analysis. Gene network analysis revealed links with steroid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation and the PI3K/Akt/CREB, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Jak-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, Akt3 acted as a hub in the network, in which 14 differentially methylated genes converged to the PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway. These findings indicate that FA stimulates NSC proliferation by modifying DNA methylation levels in the PI3K/Akt/CREB pathway.",0,1853

As cytological sampling plays an important role in assessment of thyroidal nodules, we have investigated the potential clinical use of TSHr methylation status of fine needle aspiration specimens reported according to Bethesda System. METHOD: Sixty nine patients who had both cytological and pathological diagnosis of the same nodule were selected. Four groups were composed according to cytological and pathological diagnoses: Benign (B), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), atypia of unknown significance (AUS) and follicular neoplasia (FN). The latter 2 groups were further sub-classified into 2 as benign (AUS-B and FN-B) and malignant (AUS-M and FN-M) according to final pathological diagnosis. DNAs were isolated from the fine needle aspiration cytology specimens and the methylation status of TSHr promotor region was investigated by using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Overall, TSHr methylation was present in 58% of cases; 71% of malignant and 46% of benign nodules. PTC group showed the highest TSHr methylation rate (87%), followed by 61% in AUS, 44% in B, and 30% in FN (p = 0.016). TSHr methylation rate was significantly higher in PTC group when compared to B (p = 0.013) and FN-B (p = 0.004) groups; but not in FN-M (p = 0.115) or AUS (p = 0.096) groups. All 9 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastasis showed TSHr methylation. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of TSHr methylation in determination of malignancy were calculated as 60, 66, 71 and 54%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The eminent ratio of TSHr methylation in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma against benign thyroidal nodules adduced that TSHr methylation status can be utilized as a tumor marker for well-differentiated thyroid cancer; however, it has a limited value. The determination of methylation status of TSHr gene had no efficiency on decision of the malignant potential for the nodules which are cytologically classified as atypia of undetermined significance.",3.362,288

This is frequently related to the methylation of several antagonists of this pathway. This study aimed at the assessment of the profile of methylation of Wnt pathway antagonists and the determination of the prognostic value of the methylation of selected genes in oral carcinomas. The methylation of DACH1, DKK1, LKB1, PPP2R2B, RUNX3, SFRP2, and WIF-1 was analyzed in 16 oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation of selected genes was further analyzed in tumor sections from 43 primary oral carcinoma patients. The analysis of oral carcinoma cell lines showed very frequent methylation of SFRP2 and WIF-1 and also a less frequent methylation of DACH1 and DKK1. On the other hand, RUNX3 was methylated only in one cell line, while LKB1 and PPP2R2B were not methylated in any of the cell lines. The biallelic methylation of DKK1 correlated with the low level of expression of this gene. Further evaluation of the methylation of DACH1, DKK1, and WIF1 in a clinical patient group confirmed the frequent methylation of WIF1 and intermediate or low frequency of methylation of DACH1 or DKK1, respectively. Importantly, the methylation of WIF-1 correlated with shorter survival in oral cancer patients. Overall, the methylation of the antagonists of Wnt pathway is frequently detected in oral squamous cell carcinomas.

This study aimed to determine if TLR2 promoter DNA methylation is associated with pulmonary TB. METHODS: The DNA methylation levels of 20 CpG sites over the TLR2 promoter region and TLR2 gene/protein expressions of immune cells of the blood were examined in 99 sputum culture-positive pulmonary TB patients and 77 healthy subjects (HS). RESULTS: TB patients had higher methylation levels over five CpG sites (3, 7, 9, 13, and 18), lower TLR2 gene expression, lower TLR2 expression on monocyte, higher TLR2 expression on NK cell, and higher serum TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma levels than HS after adjusting for confounding factors. Patients with a high bacillary load had lower methylation levels at CpG-15, -17, and -20. Patients with drug-resistant TB had higher CpG-18 methylation levels and lower TLR2 expression on NK cell. Patients with far advanced lesion on chest radiograph had higher serum TNF-alpha level and higher TLR2 expression on NK cell. Patients with a high TLR2 expression on NK cell had lower one-year survival. CpG-18 methylation level, TLR2 expressions on monocyte/NK cell, and TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma levels were all reversed to normal after 6-month anti-TB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant methylation of certain CpG sites over TLR2 promoter region is associated with active pulmonary TB or its phenotypes, probably through the down-regulation of TLR2 expression.",0,949

The aim of this study was to assess whether epigenetic mechanisms mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of SAM. Human monocytic THP1 cells were differentiated into macrophages and treated with 0, 500, or 1,000 mumol/l SAM for 24 h, followed by stimulation with LPS. TNFalpha and IL-10 expression levels were measured by real-time PCR, cellular concentrations of SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a metabolite of SAM, were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and DNA methylation was measured with LC-MS/MS and microarrays. Relative to control (0 mumol/l SAM), treatment with 500 mumol/l SAM caused a significant decrease in TNF-alpha expression (-45%, P < 0.05) and increase in IL-10 expression (+77%, P < 0.05). Treatment with 1,000 mumol/l SAM yielded no significant additional benefits. Relative to control, 500 mumol/l SAM increased cellular SAM concentrations twofold without changes in SAH, and 1,000 mumol/l SAM increased cellular SAM sixfold and SAH fourfold. Global DNA methylation increased 7% with 500 mumol/l SAM compared with control. Following treatment with 500 mumol/l SAM, DNA methylation microarray analysis identified 765 differentially methylated regions associated with 918 genes. Pathway analysis of these genes identified a biological network associated with cardiovascular disease, including a subset of genes that were differentially hypomethylated and whose expression levels were altered by SAM.

The functions of PTEN are regulated by a variety of posttranslational modifications such as acetylation, oxidation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, and SUMOylation. However, methylation of PTEN has not been reported so far. In this study, we demonstrated that the oncogenic protein lysine methyltransferase SET and MYND domain containing 2 (SMYD2) methylates PTEN at lysine 313 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of SMYD2 suppressed the cell growth of breast cancer cells and attenuated phosphorylation levels of AKT, indicating that SMYD2-mediated methylation negatively regulates PTEN tumor suppressor activity and results in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway. Furthermore, PTEN protein with lysine 313 substitution diminished phosphorylation of PTEN at serine 380, which is known to inactivate tumor suppressor functions of PTEN. Taken together, our findings unveil a novel mechanism of PTEN dysregulation regulated by lysine methylation in human cancer.",0,933

The goal of this study was to determine whether BMI is associated with gene methylation in breast tissue and to identify pathways that are commonly methylated in association with high BMI. Epigenome-wide methylation profiles were determined using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array in the non-diseased breast tissue of 81 women undergoing breast surgery between 2009 and 2013 at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. Multivariable, robust linear regression was performed to identify methylation sites associated with BMI at a false discovery rate q value <0.05. Gene expression microarray data was used to identify which of the BMI-associated methylation sites also showed correlation with gene expression. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to assess which pathways were enriched among the BMI-associated methylation sites. Of the 431,568 methylation sites analyzed, 2573 were associated with BMI (q value <0.05), 57 % of which showed an inverse correlation with BMI. Pathways enriched among the 2573 probe sites included those involved in inflammation, insulin receptor signaling, and leptin signaling. We were able to map 1251 of the BMI-associated methylation sites to gene expression data, and, of these, 226 (18 %) showed substantial correlations with gene expression.

Dynamic variations in DNA methylation have been reported in malignant neoplasm and aging; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. By constructing an age-associated and cancer-related weighted network (ACWN) based on the correlation of the methylation level and the protein-protein interaction, we found that DNA methylation changes associated with age were closely related to the occurrence of cancer. Additional analysis of 102 module genes mined from the ACWN revealed discrimination based on two main patterns. One pattern involved methylation levels that increased with aging and were higher in cancer patients compared with normal controls (HH pattern). The other pattern involved methylation levels that decreased with aging and were lower in cancer compared with normal (LL pattern). Upon incorporation with gene expression levels, 25 genes were filtered based on negative regulation by DNA methylation. These genes were regarded as potential cancer risk markers that were influenced by age in the process of carcinogenesis. Our results will facilitate further studies regarding the impact of the epigenetic effects of aging on diseases and will aid in the development of tailored cancer preventive strategies.",5.578,1966

For instance, epigenetic marks could provide a structural difference. Therefore, we investigated the DNA methylation of the arrays of gene copies in both promoter and gene body regions of leaf (non-expressing tissue as a control), normal endosperm, and cultured endosperm. Although we could show that expressed genes have much lower methylation levels in promoter regions than silent ones in both leaf and normal endosperm, there was surprisingly also a difference in the pattern of the z1A and z1B gene clusters. The expression of z1B gene is suppressed by increased DNA methylation and activated with reduced DNA methylation, whereas z1A gene expression is not. DNA methylation in gene coding regions is higher in leaf than in endosperm, whereas no significant difference is observed in gene bodies between expressed and non-expressed gene copies. A median CHG methylation (25-30%) appears to be optimal for gene expression. Moreover, tissue-cultured endosperm can reset the DNA methylation pattern and tissue-specific gene expression. These results reveal that DNA methylation changes of the 19-kDa zein genes is subject to plant development and tissue culture treatment, but varies in different chromosomal locations, indicating that DNA methylation changes do not apply to gene expression in a uniform fashion. Because tissue culture is used to produce transgenic plants, these studies provide new insights into variation of gene expression of integrated sequences.",3.234,165

There has been controversy over whether IVF is associated with adverse short- and long-term health outcomes of offspring. As with other prenatal factors, epigenetic change is thought to be a molecular mediator of any in utero programming effects. Most studies focused on DNA methylation at gene-specific and genomic level, with only a few on associations between DNA methylation and IVF. Using buccal epithelium from 208 twin pairs from the Peri/Postnatal Epigenetic Twin Study (PETS), we investigated associations between IVF and DNA methylation on a global level, using the proxies of Alu and LINE-1 interspersed repeats in addition to two locus-specific regulatory regions within IGF2/H19, controlling for 13 potentially confounding factors. Using multiple correction testing, we found strong evidence that IVF-conceived twins have lower DNA methylation in Alu, and weak evidence of lower methylation in one of the two IGF2/H19 regulatory regions and LINE-1, compared with naturally conceived twins. Weak evidence of a relationship between ICSI and DNA methylation within IGF2/H19 regulatory region was found, suggesting that one or more of the processes associated with IVF/ICSI may contribute to these methylation differences. Lower within- and between-pair DNA methylation variation was also found in IVF-conceived twins for LINE-1, Alu and one IGF2/H19 regulatory region. Although larger sample sizes are needed, our results provide additional insight to the possible influence of IVF and ICSI on DNA methylation.

Thus, the regulatory mechanisms of cyp19a1a gene expression are a critical research field in reproductive endocrinology. In this study, we use zebrafish as a model to study the dynamic methylation levels of the cyp19a1a gene core promoter during zebrafish ovarian folliculogenesis. The results show that there is an apparent fluctuation of the methylation levels of zebrafish cyp19a1a core promoter. Moreover, the methylation levels are inversely correlated with the expression levels of cyp19a1a transcripts when the ovarian follicles develop from PV into the MV stage. Also, the CpG dinucleotides which are close to the transcriptional starting site may have provided a significant blocking effect on inhibiting the transcriptional function of RNA polymerase II. Taken together, the results from the present study strongly suggest that DNA methylation was one of mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of cyp19a1a gene expression during folliculogenesis. This methylation mechanism modifying transcriptional process accompanied with zebrafish ovarian folliculogenesis might also shed new light on the regulation of cyp19a1a expression during the ovarian developmental stage in other vertebrates.",1.622,1642

However, data on invertebrates particularly molluscs are limited, which hinders our understanding of the evolution of DNA methylation in metazoa. The sequencing of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas genome provides an opportunity for genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in this model mollusc. RESULTS: Homologous searches against the C. gigas genome identified functional orthologs for key genes involved in DNA methylation: DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3, MBD2/3 and UHRF1. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) of the oyster's mantle tissues revealed that more than 99% methylation modification was restricted to cytosines in CpG context and methylated CpGs accumulated in the bodies of genes that were moderately expressed. Young repeat elements were another major targets of CpG methylation in oysters. Comparison with other invertebrate methylomes suggested that the 5'-end bias of gene body methylation and the negative correlation between gene body methylation and gene length were the derived features probably limited to the insect lineage. Interestingly, phylostratigraphic analysis showed that CpG methylation preferentially targeted genes originating in the common ancestor of eukaryotes rather than the oldest genes originating in the common ancestor of cellular organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analysis of the oyster DNA methylomes and that of other animal species revealed that the characteristics of DNA methylation were generally conserved during invertebrate evolution, while some unique features were derived in the insect lineage. The preference of methylation modification on genes originating in the eukaryotic ancestor rather than the oldest genes is unexpected, probably implying that the emergence of methylation regulation in these 'relatively young' genes was critical for the origin and radiation of eukaryotes.",3.986,1373

Although SET7/9 is enriched in islets and contributes to the transactivation of beta cell-specific genes, including Ins1 and Slc2a, SET7/9 has also been reported to bind the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB in non-beta cells and modify its transcriptional activity. Given that inflammation is a central component of beta cell dysfunction in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of SET7/9 in proinflammatory cytokine signaling in beta cells. To induce inflammation, betaTC3 insulinoma cells were treated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. Cytokine treatment led to increased expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, which was attenuated by the diminution of SET7/9 using RNA interference. Consistent with previous reports, SET7/9 was co-immunoprecipitated with p65 and underwent cytosolic to nuclear translocation in response to cytokines. ChIP analysis demonstrated augmented H3K4 mono- and dimethylation of the proximal Nos2 promoter with cytokine exposure. SET7/9 was found to occupy this same region, whereas SET7/9 knockdown attenuated cytokine-induced histone methylation of the Nos2 gene. To test this relationship further, islets were isolated from SET7/9-deficient and wild-type mice and treated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. Cytokine-induced Nos2 expression was reduced in the islets from SET7/9 knock-out mice. Together, our findings suggest that SET7/9 contributes to Nos2 transcription and proinflammatory cytokine signaling in the pancreatic beta cell through activating histone modifications.",0,752

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that may be related to cervical carcinogenesis. In gastric cancer, it has been demonstrated that E-cadherin gene (CDH1) hypermethylation is associated with DNMT1 overexpression by EBV infection. Our aim was to analyze the gene promoter methylation frequency of RB1 and CDH1 and verify the association between that methylation frequency and HPV and EBV infection in cervical lesions. METHODS: Sixty-five samples were obtained from cervical specimens: 15 normal cervices, 17 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 15 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and 18 cervical cancers. HPV and EBV DNA testing was performed by PCR, and the methylation status was verified by MSP. RESULTS: HPV frequency was associated with cervical cancer cases (p = 0.005) but not EBV frequency (p = 0.732). Viral co-infection showed a statistically significant correlation with cancer (p = 0.027). No viral infection was detected in 33.3% (5/15) of controls. RB1 methylated status was associated with cancer (p = 0.009) and HPV infection (p = 0.042). CDH1 methylation was not associated with cancer (p = 0.181). Controls and LSIL samples did not show simultaneous methylation, while both genes were methylated in 27.8% (5/18) of cancer samples. In the presence of EBV, CDH1 methylation was present in 27.8% (5/18) of cancer samples. Only cancer cases presented RB1 promoter methylation in the presence of HPV and EBV (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of both genes increased with disease progression. With EBV, RB1 methylation was a tumor-associated event because only the cancer group presented methylated RB1 with HPV infection. HPV infection was shown to be significantly correlated with cancer conditions. The global methylation frequency was higher when HPV was present, showing its epigenetic role in cervical carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, EBV seems to be a cofactor and needs to be further investigated.

In neurons, the intracellular alkalization is shown to occur after stimulating several channels and receptors. For example, it has previously demonstrated in P19 neurons that a sustained intracellular alkalinization can be mediated by the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. In addition, the benzodiazepine binding subtypes of the gamma-amino butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor mediate a transient intracellular alkalinization when they are stimulated. Because the activities of many enzymes are sensitive to pH shift, here we investigate the effects of intracellular pH modulation resulted from stimulating GABAA receptor on the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) activities. We show that the major benzodiazepine subtype (2alpha1, 2beta2, 1gamma2) is constitutively expressed in both undifferentiated P19 cells and retinoic acid (RA) differentiated P19 neurons. Furthermore stimulation with diazepam and, diazepam plus muscimol produce an intracellular alkalinization that can be detected ex vivo with the fluorescence dye. The alkalinization results in significant perturbation in protein arginine methylation activity as measured in methylation assays with specific protein substrates. Altered protein arginine methylation is also observed when cells are treated with the GABAA agonist muscimol but not an antagonist, bicuculline. These data suggest that pH-dependent and pH-independent methylation pathways can be activated by GABAAergic stimulation, which we verified using hippocampal slice preparations from a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.",2.03,897

On the contrary, the low levels of H3K27me3 induce the expression of COR15A and ATGOLS3, which encode for low temperature protective proteins of chloroplast (Cor15am) and Galactional Synthase (GOLS), in order to resist cold stress. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of histone lysine methylation involved in DNA methylation, plant flowering and stress response.",0,967

METHODS: DNA methylation profiles in the HERV (K, W, E) and LINE sequences were determined by bisulfite genomic sequencing. The transcription of these genome segments was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: In HERV-K, HERV-W and LINE-1.2 the levels of DNA methylation ranged between 75 and 98%, while in HERV-E they were around 60%. Nevertheless, the HERV and LINE-1.2 sequences were actively transcribed. No differences were found in comparisons of HERV and LINE-1.2 CpG methylation and transcription patterns between non-transgenomic and plasmid-transgenomic HCT116 cells. CONCLUSION: The insertion of a 5.6 kbp plasmid into the HCT116 genome had no effect on the HERV and LINE-1.2 methylation and transcription profiles, although other parts of the HCT116 genome had shown marked changes. These repetitive sequences are transcribed, probably because the large number of HERV and LINE-1.2 elements harbor copies with non- or hypo-methylated long terminal repeat sequences.",4.649,1571

Numerous studies sustain a causal link between global DNA hypomethylation and genetic instability. It has been suggested that DNA hypomethylation might affect the structure and dynamics of chromatin regions that are critical for chromosome stability and segregation, thus favouring chromosomal nondisjunction during meiosis. Maternal global DNA hypomethylation has not yet been analyzed as a potential risk factor for chromosome 21 nondisjunction. This study aimed to asses the risk for DS in association with maternal global DNA methylation and the impact of endogenous and exogenous factors that reportedly influence DNA methylation status. Global DNA methylation was analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes by quantifying LINE-1 methylation using the MethyLight method. Levels of global DNA methylation were significantly lower among mothers of children with maternally derived trisomy 21 than among control mothers (P = 0.000). The combination of MTHFR C677T genotype and diet significantly influenced global DNA methylation (R2 = 4.5%, P = 0.046). The lowest values of global DNA methylation were observed in mothers with MTHFR 677 CT+TT genotype and low dietary folate.

Few epidemiological studies have explored the potential mediation effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its DNA methylation. METHODS: We designed a longitudinal panel study with 4 follow-ups among 36 healthy college students in Shanghai, China from December 17, 2014 to July 11, 2015. We measured personal real-time exposure to PM2.5, serum ACE level, and blood methylation of ACE gene and the repetitive elements. We applied linear mixed-effects models to examine the effects of PM2.5 on ACE protein, DNA methylation and BP markers. Furthermore, we conducted mediation analyses to evaluate the potential pathways. RESULTS: An interquartile range increase (26.78mug/m(3)) in 24-h average exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with 1.12 decreases in ACE average methylation (%5mC), 13.27% increase in ACE protein, and increments of 1.13mmHg in systolic BP, 0.66mmHg in diastolic BP and 0.82mmHg in mean arterial pressure. ACE hypomethylation mediated 11.78% (P=0.03) of the elevated ACE protein by PM2.5. Increased ACE protein accounted for 3.90~13.44% (P=0.35~0.68) of the elevated BP by PM2.5. Repetitive-element methylation was also decreased but did not significantly mediate the association between PM2.5 and BP.

The capacity for DNA methylation to be altered by environmental conditions, and potentially passed between generations, makes it a prime candidate for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Here we conduct the first analysis of the Mimulus guttatus methylome, with a focus on the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression. RESULTS: We present a whole genome methylome for the inbred line Iron Mountain 62 (IM62). DNA methylation varies across chromosomes, genomic regions, and genes. We develop a model that predicts gene expression based on DNA methylation (R(2) = 0.2). Post hoc analysis of this model confirms prior relationships, and identifies novel relationships between methylation and gene expression. Additionally, we find that DNA methylation is significantly depleted near gene transcriptional start sites, which may explain the recently discovered elevated rate of recombination in these same regions. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment here of a reference methylome will be a useful resource for the continued advancement of M. guttatus as a model system. Using a model-based approach, we demonstrate that methylation patterns are an important predictor of variation in gene expression. This model provides a novel approach for differential methylation analysis that generates distinct and testable hypotheses regarding gene expression.",3.986,409

To date, the molecular determinants of a healthy human liver cell phenotype remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we assess the transcriptome and the genome-wide promoter methylome specific for purified, non-cultured human hepatocytes, LSECs and HSCs, and investigate the nature of epigenetic changes accompanying transcriptional changes associated with activation of HSCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression profile and promoter methylome of purified, uncultured human liver cells and culture-activated HSCs were respectively determined using Affymetrix HG-U219 genechips and by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled to promoter array hybridization. Histone modification patterns were assessed at the single-gene level by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We unveil a DNA-methylation-based epigenetic relationship between hepatocytes, LSECs and HSCs despite their distinct ontogeny. We show that liver cell type-specific DNA methylation targets early developmental and differentiation-associated functions. Integrative analysis of promoter methylome and transcriptome reveals partial concordance between DNA methylation and transcriptional changes associated with human HSC activation. Further, we identify concordant histone methylation and acetylation changes in the promoter and putative novel enhancer elements of genes involved in liver fibrosis.

To determine when methylation is established during cell immortalization and whether it is hrHPV-type dependent, DNA methylation was studied in a large panel of HPVE6E7-immortalized keratinocyte cell lines. These cell lines displayed different growth behaviors, i.e., continuous growth versus crisis period prior to immortalization, reflecting differential immortalization capacities of the 7 HPV-types (16/18/31/33/45/66/70) studied. In this study, cells were monitored for hypermethylation of 14 host genes (APC, CADM1, CYGB, FAM19A4, hTERT, mir124-1, mir124-2, mir124-3, MAL, PHACTR3, PRDM14, RASSF1A, ROBO3, and SFRP2) at 4 different stages during immortalization. A significant increase in overall methylation levels was seen with progression through each stage of immortalization. At stage 1 (pre-immortalization), a significant increase in methylation of hTERT, mir124-2, and PRDM14 was already apparent, which continued over time. Methylation of ROBO3 was significantly increased at stage 2 (early immortal), followed by CYGB (stage 3) and FAM19A4, MAL, PHACTR3, and SFRP2 (stage 4). Methylation patterns were mostly growth behavior independent. Yet, hTERT methylation levels were significantly increased in cells that just escaped from crisis. Bisulfite sequencing of hTERT confirmed increased methylation in immortal cells compared to controls, with the transcription core and known repressor sites remaining largely unmethylated. In conclusion, HPV-induced immortalization is associated with a sequential and progressive increase in promoter methylation of a subset of genes, which is mostly independent of the viral immortalization capacity.",4.78,789

METHODS: A total of 119 patients with ACHBLF, 60 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. We used a quantitative methylation detection technique, MethyLight, to examine the methylation levels of GSTM3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: The GSTM3 methylation level was significantly higher in patients with ACHBLF than those in patients with chronic hepatitis B and healthy controls (both P < 0.05). In patients with ACHBLF, GSTM3 methylation level percentage of methylated reference (PMR) positively correlated with total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and negatively correlated with prothrombin activity and albumin (all P < 0.05). The PMR for GSTM3 of non-survivors was significantly increased compared to that of survivors (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that GSTM3 methylation level was one of the independent prognostic factors for 3-month mortality of ACHBLF (P = 0.000). The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of PMR for GSTM3 in predicting 3-month mortality of ACHBLF was not statistically different from that of MELD score (0.798 vs. 0.716, P = 0.152).

On H19 imprinting control region (ICR), one of the mechanisms regulating the paternal allelic specific silence is DNA methylation in somatic cells throughout the individual's whole life. Nevertheless, this pattern of DNA methylation is erased and re-established in germline. As results, in mature sperm H19 ICR shows biallelic methylation instead of paternal specific methylation in somatic cells. Although the data were mainly from experiments on mice the same mechanisms are believed existing in human germline. We designed an experiment to probe the sperm DNA by methylation sensitive restriction enzyme based nested qPCR (MSRE-nested-qPCR). The genomic DNA digested/undigested by HhaI was amplified by outer primers encompassing four HhaI sites on H19 ICR.

Aberrant changes in DNA methylation may be an early event in carcinogenesis. However, possible relations between PAH-DNA adducts, methylation, and breast cancer are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess associations between PAH-DNA adducts, and breast cancer, stratified by DNA methylation markers and (2) examine interactions between adducts and DNA methylation in association with breast cancer and tumor subtype. METHODS: In a population-based case-control study, promoter methylation of 13 breast cancer-related genes was measured in tumor tissue (n = 765-851 cases). Blood DNA from breast cancer cases (n = 873) and controls (n = 941) was used to assess PAH-DNA adducts and global methylation. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI); and the ratio of the OR (ROR) was used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: Women with detectable PAH-DNA adducts and methylated RARbeta (ROR 2.69, 95% CI 1.02-7.12; p for interaction = 0.03) or APC (ROR 1.76, 95% CI 0.87-3.58; p for interaction = 0.09) genes were more likely to have hormone receptor-positive tumors than other subtypes. Interactions with other methylation markers were not apparent (p >/= 0.10). The association between adducts and breast cancer did not vary by methylation status of the tumor nor did adducts associate with global methylation in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gene-specific methylation of RARbeta, and perhaps APC, may interact with PAH-DNA adducts to increase risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. There was little evidence that adducts were associated with or interacted with other methylation markers of interest.",2.735,118

We generated highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (HTB56 and A549) by using in vivo selection approach. These were, then, subjected to DNA methylation analysis (genome-wide). We also explored the therapeutic effects of azacytidine, an epigenetic agent, on DNA methylation patterns as well as the in vivo phenotypes. During the development of highly aggressive cell lines, we observed widespread modulations in DNA methylation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was used and compared with the less aggressive parental cell lines to identify the differential methylation, which was achieved up to 2.7 % of CpG-rich region. Azacytidine inhibited DNA methyltransferase and reversed the prometastatic phenotype. We found its high association with the preferential loss of DNA methylation from hypermethylated sites. After persisted exposure of azacytidine, we observed that DNA methylation affected the polycomb-binding sites. We found close association of DNA methylome modifications with metastatic capability of non-small cell lung cancer. We also concluded that epigenetic modulation could be used as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent metastasis formation as prometastatic phenotype was reversed due to inhibition of DNA methyltransferase.",0,544

 developmental biology",2014,"Lysine methylation has been traditionally associated with histones and epigenetics. Recently, lysine methyltransferases and demethylases - which are involved in methylation of non-histone substrates - have been frequently found deregulated in human tumours. In this realm, a new discovery has unveiled the methyltransferase SMYD3 as an enhancer of Ras-driven cancer. SMYD3 is up-regulated in different types of tumours. SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 increases mutant K-Ras-induced activation of ERK1/2. Methylation of MAP3K2 prevents it from binding to the phosphatase PP2A, thereby impeding the impact of this negative regulator on Ras-ERK1/2 signals, leading to the formation of lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, depletion of SMYD3 synergises with a MEK inhibitor, currently in clinical trials, to block Ras-driven pancreatic neoplasia. These results underscore the importance of lysine methylation in the regulation of signalling pathways relevant for tumourigenesis and endorse the development of drugs targeting unregulated lysine methylation as therapeutic agents in the struggle against cancer.",0,102

The expression of several factors that control epigenetic modification is upregulated in the blastema compared with differentiated tissue, suggesting that epigenetic changes in gene expression might control the differentiation status of blastema cells during regeneration. To clarify the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation during regeneration, we focused on the function of the Gryllus Enhancer of zeste [Gb'E(z)] and Ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat gene on the X chromosome (Gb'Utx) homologues, which regulate methylation and demethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), respectively. Methylated histone H3K27 in the regenerating leg was diminished by Gb'E(z)(RNAi) and was increased by Gb'Utx(RNAi). Regenerated Gb'E(z)(RNAi) cricket legs exhibited extra leg segment formation between the tibia and tarsus, and regenerated Gb'Utx(RNAi) cricket legs showed leg joint formation defects in the tarsus. In the Gb'E(z)(RNAi) regenerating leg, the Gb'dac expression domain expanded in the tarsus. By contrast, in the Gb'Utx(RNAi) regenerating leg, Gb'Egfr expression in the middle of the tarsus was diminished. These results suggest that regulation of the histone H3K27 methylation state is involved in the repatterning process during leg regeneration among cricket species via the epigenetic regulation of leg patterning gene expression.",0,896

Here, we demonstrate that the fission yeast HP1 protein Swi6 exists as a single highly dynamic population that rapidly exchanges in cis and in trans between different heterochromatic regions. Binding to methylated H3K9 or to heterochromatic RNA decelerates Swi6 mobility. We further show that Swi6 is largely dispensable to the maintenance of heterochromatin domains. In the absence of Swi6, H3K9 methylation levels are maintained by a mechanism that depends on polymeric self-association properties of Tas3, a subunit of the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex. Our results disclose a surprising role for Swi6 dimerization in demarcating constitutive heterochromatin from neighboring euchromatin. Thus, rather than promoting maintenance and spreading of heterochromatin, Swi6 appears to limit these processes and appropriately confine heterochromatin.",0,389

The presence or absence of epigenetic aberrations, more specifically DNA-methylation of GSTP1, RASSF1, and APC in histopathologically negative prostate core biopsies has resulted in an increased negative predictive value (NPV) of  approximately 90% and thus could lead to a reduction of unnecessary repeat biopsies. Here, it is investigated whether, in methylation-positive men, DNA-methylation intensities could help to identify those men harboring high-grade (Gleason score >/=7) PCa, resulting in an improved positive predictive value. METHODS: Two cohorts, consisting of men with histopathologically negative index biopsies, followed by a positive or negative repeat biopsy, were combined. EpiScore, a methylation intensity algorithm was developed in methylation-positive men, using area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic as metric for performance. Next, a risk score was developed combining EpiScore with traditional clinical risk factors to further improve the identification of high-grade (Gleason Score >/=7) cancer. RESULTS: Compared to other risk factors, detection of DNA-methylation in histopathologically negative biopsies was the most significant and important predictor of high-grade cancer, resulting in a NPV of 96%. In methylation-positive men, EpiScore was significantly higher for those with high-grade cancer detected upon repeat biopsy, compared to those with either no or low-grade cancer. The risk score resulted in further improvement of patient risk stratification and was a significantly better predictor compared to currently used metrics as PSA and the prostate cancer prevention trial (PCPT) risk calculator (RC). A decision curve analysis indicated strong clinical utility for the risk score as decision-making tool for repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Low DNA-methylation levels in PCa-negative biopsies led to a NPV of 96% for high-grade cancer. The risk score, comprising DNA-methylation intensity and traditional clinical risk factors, improved the identification of men with high-grade cancer, with a maximum avoidance of unnecessary repeat biopsies. This risk score resulted in better patient risk stratification and significantly outperformed current risk prediction models such as PCPTRC and PSA.

Here, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA promoter region and 5'-external transcribed spacer/5'ETS) and the promoter of the proline rich membrane anchor 1 gene (PRIMA1) in peripheral blood samples of 24 female patients (mean age (33 +/- 11) years) diagnosed with DSM-IV BPD and in 11 female controls (mean age (32 +/- 7) years). A significant aberrant methylation of rDNA and PRIMA1 was revealed for BPD patients using pyrosequencing. For the promoter of PRIMA1, the average methylation of six CpG sites was 1.6-fold higher in BPD patients compared to controls. In contrast, the methylation levels of the rDNA promoter region and the 5'ETS were significantly lower (0.9-fold) in patients with BPD compared to controls. Thus, for nine CpGs located in the rDNA promoter region and for four CpGs at the 5'ETS decreased methylation was found in peripheral blood of patients compared to controls. Our results suggest that aberrant methylation of rDNA and PRIMA1 is associated with the pathogenesis of BPD.",2.862,1312

The protein was studied using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and DNA methylation was studied using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: PPAR-gamma is expressed in all large conducting airways, particularly in goblet cells and bronchial glands, in the canine lung. The protein is also expressed in interstitial macrophages. PPAR-gamma is expressed in 33 % of canine non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 66 % of metastatic osteosarcoma (OSA) cases. There is a significant loss of 5' PPAR-gamma methylation from normal lung to primary lung cancer and metastatic OSA (p = 0.0002), however altered PPAR-gamma promoter methylation at the interrogated locus does not appear to be associated with changes in protein expression.

Depression was diagnosed (major or minor depressive disorder) according to DSM-IV criteria and depression severity was estimated by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We assessed BDNF promoter methylation using leukocyte DNA. The effects of BDNF methylation on depression diagnosis and severity were investigated using multivariate logistic and linear regression models, respectively. The two-way interaction between BDNF methylation and the val66met polymorphism on depression was also evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Higher BDNF methylation was independently associated with depression diagnosis and with more severe symptoms at both 1 week and 1 year after mastectomy. No significant methylation-genotype interactions were found. CONCLUSION: A role for BDNF in depression related to breast cancer was supported. Indeed, the association between depression and BDNF methylation may be useful for identifying patients who are at high risk for depression and for suggesting directions for promising drug research.",1.28,1703

Methylation of Arg30 and Arg35 on p65 is critical for TNF induction of CXCL10 in EC. Here we show that PRMT5-mediated methylation of p65 at Arg174 is required for induction of CXCL11 when EC are costimulated with TNF and IFN-gamma. Knockdown of PRMT5 by RNAi reduced CXCL11 mRNA and protein levels in costimulated cells. Reconstitution of p65 Arg174Ala or Arg174Lys mutants into EC that were depleted of endogenous p65 blunted TNF plus IFN-gamma-mediated CXCL11 induction. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that p65 Arg174 arginine methylation is enhanced by TNF plus IFN-gamma costimulation, and is catalyzed by PRMT5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) demonstrated that PRMT5 is necessary for p65 association with the CXCL11 promoter in response to TNF plus IFN-gamma. Further, reconstitution of p65 Arg174Lys mutant in EC abrogated this p65 association with the CXCL11 promoter. Finally, ChIP and Re-ChIP assays revealed that symmetrical dimethylarginine-containing proteins complexed with the CXCL11 promoter were diminished in p65 Arg174Lys-reconstituted EC stimulated with TNF and IFN-gamma. In total, these results indicate that PRMT5-mediated p65 methylation at Arg174 is essential for TNF plus IFN-gamma-mediated CXCL11 gene induction. We therefore suggest that the use of recently developed small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 may present a therapeutic approach to moderating chronic inflammatory pathologies.",3.234,75

It remains unclear how H. pylori CagA initiates or maintains RUNX3 promoter methylation and inactivates its protein expression in gastric carcinoma. METHODS: RUNX3 promoter methylation status, RUNX3 expression, and H. pylori CagA were investigated in 76 sample pairs of gastric carcinoma tissue. The patients' medical records were reviewed. The association between RUNX3 methylation or loss of RUNX3 expression and clinicopathologic variables according to H. pylori CagA status were investigated. RESULTS: In gastric carcinoma patients with H. pylori CagA-positive infection, RUNX3 methylation did not show association with lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and TNM stages. However RUNX3 methylation was observed more frequently in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma (77.8% vs. 20.0%, p=0.023) in early stage. In gastric carcinoma patients with H. pylori CagA-positive infection, loss of RUNX3 expression did not show association with lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and TNM stages. However loss of RUNX3 expression was observed more frequently in early gastric carcinoma than in advanced gastric carcinoma (84.2% vs. 75.0%, p=0.51), but this difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In gastric carcinoma patients with H. pylori CagA-positive infection, RUNX3 methylation or loss of RUNX3 expression did not show correlation with lymphovascular invasion and TNM stages. In early gastric carcinoma patients with H. pylori CagA-positive infection, RUNX3 methylation was observed more in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma.",0,14

The sensitive and convenient analysis of gene-specific methylation is wishful but challenging due to the lack of means that can sensitively and sequence-selectively discriminate 5-mC from cytosine without the need for polymerase chain reaction. Here we report a chemical-oxidation cleavage triggered exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) method named COEXPAR for gene-specific methylation analysis. EXPAR was proved to not only have rapid amplification kinetics under isothermal condition but also show excellent sequence-selectivity and linear-dependence on EXPAR trigger. Further initiation of EXPAR by chemical-cleavage of DNA at 5-mC, the COEXPAR showed high specificity for methylated and nonmethylated DNA, and  approximately 10(7) copies of triggers were replicated in 20 min, which were used to quantify the methylation level at the methylation loci. As a result, the gene-specific methylation level of a p53 gene fragment, as a target model, was analyzed in two linear ranges of 10 fM-1 pM and 1 pM-10 nM, and limits of detection of 411 aM (S/N = 3) by fluorescence, and 576 aM (S/N = 3) by electrochemistry.

It has previously been shown that methylation of the GATA-4 gene promoter region in sputum DNA is associated with low lung function and increased odds of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among smokers. Given these findings, we hypothesized that GATA-4 gene methylation in sputum DNA would be associated with low health status, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), in subjects with COPD. Self-reported SGRQ, spirometry, and induced sputum samples were obtained from 168 COPD subjects from the Lovelace Smokers Cohort. GATA-4 gene methylation was evaluated in sputum DNA using nested methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Using general linear model with Poisson regression, we found that GATA-4 gene methylation was significantly associated with overall lower SGRQ health status (parameter estimate = .296, p < .001). This finding remained significant even after controlling for age, lung function, and other covariates. In an additional analysis using logistic regression and comparing extreme tertiles of overall SGRQ score, we confirmed that GATA-4 gene methylation was associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of poor health status (OR 2.95 and p = .028). The unexplored links between epigenetic changes and psychosocial factors such as health status are critical gaps in the literature.

The sequence of the methylation states of cytosines on any given read forms a methylation pattern that carries substantially more information than merely studying the average methylation level at individual positions.

However, the accurate quantification of methylation patterns is subject to sequencing errors and spurious signals due to incomplete bisulphite conversion of cytosines. RESULTS: A statistical model is developed which accounts for the distribution of DNA methylation patterns at any given locus. The model incorporates the effects of sequencing errors and spurious reads, and enables estimation of the true underlying distribution of methylation patterns.

DNA methylation levels in peripheral leukocytes have been associated with different environmental exposures and immune or inflammatory response. We aimed to identify methylation signatures of peripheral leukocytes that could track hepatitis B progression to HCC, especially for early-onset HCC. We first performed an epigenome-wide association analysis on 48 matched case-control pairs in a nested case-control study within a 22-yr follow-up cohort of HBV carriers. Through this analysis we found that progression to early-onset HCC involved methylation variable positions across the genome, in which a substantial proportion displayed significant variation due to HBV viral load, chronic hepatitis status, and/or leukocyte subtype composition, and these associations were significantly enriched among genes in immune pathways. Methylation at probes cg00300879, cg06872964, and cg07080864, that are located within the proximal promoter of CNKSR1, IFI44L, and PENK, respectively, was validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing and findings were replicated in a case-sibling study of early-onset HCC (134 cases vs. 174 sibling controls). Furthermore, a high methylation score, constructed using the three probes, was predictive for the risk of early-onset HCC in two datasets (adjusted-odds ratios = 0.21-0.32, p</=0.0206). This association was also observed for late-onset HCC (adjusted-odds ratio = 0.42-0.47, p</=0.0194) in a nested case-control study (120 cases vs. 178 controls). In prospective analysis, change in the score was detected 5-9 years before HCC onset.

In the present study, 30 bone marrow samples derived from patients with AML were collected prior and subsequent to chemotherapy. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter in the bone marrow specimens was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that the methylation status of the MGMT promoter was influenced by different chemotherapeutic regimens. The MGMT methylation status of M4 patients (3 out of 6) were more chemosensitive, compared with that of patients with other AML subtypes (M1, 1 out of 3; M2, 0 out of 8; M3, 3 out of 7; M5, 0 out of 3; and M6, 1 out of 3). Age-based analysis revealed that the group aged </=60 years (7 out of 24 patients) exhibited more methylation changes than patients aged >60 years (1 out of 6). Male patients (4 out of 13) were more susceptible to chemotherapy-induced methylation changes than female patients (4 out of 17).

Whereas, the methylation ratio raised to 38.7% after 30 days cultivation, indicating that methylation level of hypocotyls ranged during tissue culture. Moreover, we observed that the methylation level in callus is the highest during regeneration of rape-seed, following the regenerated plantlets and hypocotyls.

A high level of genome-wide epigenetic divergence between individuals occupying distinct habitats is therefore predicted. Here, we introduce bisulfite-converted restriction site associated DNA sequencing (bsRADseq), an approach to quantify the level of DNA methylation differentiation across multiple individuals. This reduced representation method is flexible in the extent of DNA sequence interrogated. We showcase its applicability in three natural systems, each comprising individuals adapted to divergent environments: a diploid plant (Heliosperma, Caryophyllaceae), a tetraploid plant (Dactylorhiza, Orchidaceae) and an animal (Gasterosteusaculeatus, Gasterosteidae). We present a robust bioinformatic pipeline, combining tools for RAD locus assembly, SNP calling, bisulfite-converted read mapping and DNA methylation calling to analyse bsRADseq data with or without a reference genome. Importantly, our approach accurately distinguishes between SNPs and methylation polymorphism (SMPs). Although DNA methylation frequency between different positions of a genome varies widely, we find a surprisingly high consistency in the methylation profile between individuals thriving in divergent ecological conditions, particularly in Heliosperma. This constitutive stability points to significant molecular or developmental constraints acting on DNA methylation variation. Altogether, by combining the flexibility of RADseq with the accuracy of bisulfite sequencing in quantifying DNA methylation, the bsRADseq methodology and our bioinformatic pipeline open up the opportunity for genome-wide epigenetic investigations of evolutionary and ecological relevance in non-model species, independent of their genomic features.",6.494,873

Aberrant changes in DNA methylation status are ubiquitous in human cancer and the detection of these changes can be informative for cancer diagnosis. Herein, we reported a facile quantum dot-based (QD-based) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique for the detection of DNA methylation. The method relies on methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes for the differential digestion of genomic DNA based on its methylation status. Digested DNA is then subjected to PCR amplification for the incorporation of Alexa Fluor-647 (A647) fluorophores. DNA methylation levels can be detected qualitatively through gel analysis and quantitatively by the signal amplification from QDs to A647 during FRET. Furthermore, the methylation levels of three tumor suppressor genes, PCDHGB6, HOXA9 and RASSF1A, in 20 lung adenocarcinoma and 20 corresponding adjacent nontumorous tissue (NT) samples were measured to verify the feasibility of the QD-based FRET method and a high sensitivity for cancer detection (up to 90%) was achieved.

Among the four CpG sites in the methylation assay, CpG4 and the other three CpGs (CpG1-3) were not in high correlation (r<0.5). Significantly elevated methylation levels of GCK CpG4 methylation were observed in T2D patients than in the healthy controls (P=0.004). A breakdown analysis by gender indicated that the association between CpG4 methylation and T2D was specific to males (P=0.002).

We compared the performance of HPV16/18 genotyping with a predefined DNA methylation triage test (S5) based on target regions of the human gene EPB41L3, and viral late gene regions of HPV16, HPV18, HPV31 and HPV33. Assays were run using exfoliated cervical specimens from 710 women attending routine screening, of whom 38 were diagnosed with CIN2+ within a year after triage to colposcopy based on cytology and 341 were hrHPV positive. Sensitivity and specificity of the investigated triage methods were compared by McNemar's test. At the predefined cutoff, S5 showed better sensitivity than HPV16/18 genotyping (74% vs 54%, P = 0.04) in identifying CIN2+ in hrHPV-positive women, and similar specificity (65% vs 71%, P = 0.07). When the S5 cutoff was altered to allow equal sensitivity to that of genotyping, a significantly higher specificity of 91% was reached (P < 0.0001).

During melanocyte transformation and melanoma progression the expression profile of many genes changes. Among these, a gene implicated in several steps of melanocyte development, TFAP2A, is frequently silenced; however, the molecular mechanism of TFAP2A silencing in human melanoma remains unknown. In this study, we measured TFAP2A mRNA expression in primary human melanocytes compared to 11 human melanoma samples by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In addition, we assessed CpG DNA methylation of the TFAP2A promoter in these samples using bisulfite sequencing. Compared to primary melanocytes, which showed high TFAP2A mRNA expression and no promoter methylation, human melanoma samples showed decreased TFAP2A mRNA expression and increased promoter methylation. We further show that increased CpG methylation correlates with decreased TFAP2A mRNA expression. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas, we further identified TFAP2A as a gene displaying among the most decreased expression in stage 4 melanomas vs. non-stage 4 melanomas, and whose CpG methylation was frequently associated with lack of mRNA expression. Based on our data, we conclude that TFAP2A expression in human melanomas can be silenced by aberrant CpG methylation of the TFAP2A promoter. We have identified aberrant CpG DNA methylation as an epigenetic mark associated with TFAP2A silencing in human melanoma that could have significant implications for the therapy of human melanoma using epigenetic modifying drugs.",4.78,943

However, when the same lung was exposed to allergen and diesel exhaust but separated by approximately 4 weeks, significant changes in more than 500 sites were observed. Furthermore, sites of differential methylation differed depending on which exposure was experienced first. Functional analysis of differentially methylated CpG sites found genes involved in transcription factor activity, protein metabolism, cell adhesion, and vascular development, among others. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that specific exposures can prime the lung for changes in DNA methylation induced by a subsequent insult.",0,1845

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between Ala133Ser polymorphism or promoter methylation in RASSF1A and the prognosis of HCC in Nantong City, one of the areas with the highest incidence of cancer in China. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using peripheral blood plasma, the incidence rate of RASSF1A Ala133Ser in 235 controls and subjects with 260 HCC was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. We further investigated the RASSF1A methylation status in HCC and corresponding peri-tumorous normal tissues using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction approach. RESULTS: It was found that the frequency of the RASSF1A Ala133Ser T allele (Ala/Ser and Ser/Ser) genotype in HCC cases was observably higher than that of normal subjects (P < 0.001). In comparison to the Ala/Ala genotype, the T allele genotype improved the susceptibility to HCC. The study also found that RASSF1A methylation improves the risk of HCC. Furthermore, in contrast with the corresponding peri-tumorous normal tissues, we observed that the RASSF1A methylation status was markedly higher in HCC tissues (P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses suggested that the poor survival of HCC patients was closely connected with hepatocirrhosis, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, Edmondson division, RASSF1A methylation and Ala133Ser polymorphism (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism and promoter methylation of RASSF1A may be a significant factor in HCC, and can be an indicator for poor prognosis in patients with HCC.",1.932,1751

In this study, we created a transgenic rat model and investigated the transgenerational methylation patterns in these animals. The transgene DNA fragment was unmethylated before it was injected into the pronucleus, so it is a good model to study the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns. We performed bisulfite sequencing on 23 CpG dinucleotides on the transgene across three generations in two tissues. We observed that the transgene was heavily methylated in the liver (87.53%) from the founder generation, whereas its methylation rate was much lower in the kidney (70.47%). Spearman correlation analysis showed that there was a strong correlation on the methylation status between different generations in the same tissue, which was observed in both liver and kidney, and among all individuals in this pedigree.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic event that plays an important role in human diseases via regulation of gene expression. However, the integrative association between DNA methylation and gene expression in T21 fetal placenta has yet to be determined. METHODS: We profiled expression of 207 genes on chr21 and their DNA methylation patterns in placenta samples from normal and DS fetuses using microarray analysis and predicted the functions of differentially expressed genes using bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: We found 47 genes with significantly increased expression in the T21 placenta compared to the normal placenta. Hypomethylation of the 47 genes was observed in the T21 placenta. Most of hypomethylated DNA positions were intragenic regions, i.e. regions inside a gene. Moreover, gene expression and hypomethylated DNA position showed significantly positive associations. By analyzing the properties of the gene-disease network, we found that increased genes in the T21 placenta were significantly associated with T21 and T21 complications such as mental retardation, neurobehavioral manifestations, and congenital abnormalities. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively survey the association between gene expression and DNA methylation in chr21 of the T21 fetal placenta. Our findings provide a broad overview of the relationships between gene expression and DNA methylation in the placentas of fetuses with T21 and could contribute to future research efforts concerning genes involvement in disease pathogenesis.",2.71,1676
25966912,Germline-derived DNA methylation and early embryo epigenetic reprogramming: The selected survival of imprints.,['Monk D'],The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2015,"DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism involved in many essential cellular processes. During development epigenetic reprograming takes place during gametogenesis and then again in the pre-implantation embryo. These two reprograming windows ensure genome-wide removal of methylation in the primordial germ cells so that sex-specific signatures can be acquired in the sperm and oocyte. Following fertilization the majority of this epigenetic information is erased to give the developing embryo an epigenetic profile coherent with pluripotency. It is estimated that  approximately 65% of the genome is differentially methylated between the gametes, however following embryonic reprogramming only parent-of-origin methylation at known imprinted loci remains. This suggests that trans-acting factors such as Zfp57 can discriminate imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from the thousands of CpG rich regions that are differentially marked in the gametes. Recently transient imprinted DMRs have been identified suggesting that these loci are also protected from pre-implantation reprograming but succumb to de novo remethylation at the implantation stage.

Histone modification was one of the underlying epigenetic mechanisms during spermatogenesis. It has been shown that methylation of histone lysine exhibits a distinct distribution in mice during spermatogenesis and some histone lysine methylation is essential for male fertility. However, the dynamic change of methylated histone in porcine testis tissue was largely unknown. Here, we studied the dynamic modulation of three types of methylation (monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation) of H3K4, H3K27, and H4K20 during spermatogenesis in pigs. The results showed that H3K4me2/3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me1/2/3 were extensively localized in adult pig testis. Interestingly, we found that undifferentiated spermatogonia contained strongly H4K20me2 and H4K20me3, but little H4K20me1, whereas the differentiated spermatogonia possessed H4K20me1 and H4K20me2 and little H4K20me3.

Previous studies in psoriasis have concentrated on epigenetic changes in immune cells or in total skin biopsies that include stromal-associated changes. In order to improve our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in psoriasis, we sought to obtain a comprehensive DNA methylation signature specific for the epidermal component of psoriasis and to analyze methylation changes during therapy. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of epidermal cells from 12 patients undergoing narrow-band UVB phototherapy and 12 corresponding healthy controls revealed a distinct DNA methylation pattern in psoriasis compared with controls. A total of 3,665 methylation variable positions (MVPs) were identified with an overall hypomethylation in psoriasis patient samples. DNA methylation pattern was reversed at the end of phototherapy in patients showing excellent clinical improvement. Only 7% of phototherapy-affected MVPs (150 out of 2,108) correlate with nearby gene expression.

However, so far, only a limited number of DNA methylation markers have been introduced into clinical practice. One reason why the vast majority of methylation markers do not translate into clinical applications is lack of independent validation of methylation markers, often caused by differences in methylation analysis techniques. We recently described RET promoter CpG island methylation as a potential prognostic marker in stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) patients of two independent series. METHODS: In the current study, we analyzed the RET promoter CpG island methylation of 241 stage II colon cancer patients by direct methylation-specific PCR (MSP), nested-MSP, pyrosequencing, and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM). All primers were designed as close as possible to the same genomic region. In order to investigate the effect of different DNA methylation assays on patient outcome, we assessed the clinical sensitivity and specificity as well as the association of RET methylation with overall survival for three and five years of follow-up. RESULTS: Using direct-MSP and nested-MSP, 12.0 % (25/209) and 29.6 % (71/240) of the patients showed RET promoter CpG island methylation. Methylation frequencies detected by pyrosequencing were related to the threshold for positivity that defined RET methylation. Methylation frequencies obtained by pyrosequencing (threshold for positivity at 20 %) and MS-HRM were 13.3 % (32/240) and 13.8 % (33/239), respectively. The pyrosequencing threshold for positivity of 20 % showed the best correlation with MS-HRM and direct-MSP results. Nested-MSP detected RET promoter CpG island methylation in deceased patients with a higher sensitivity (33.1 %) compared to direct-MSP (10.7 %), pyrosequencing (14.4 %), and MS-HRM (15.4 %). While RET methylation frequencies detected by nested-MSP, pyrosequencing, and MS-HRM varied, the prognostic effect seemed similar (HR 1.74, 95 % CI 0.97-3.15; HR 1.85, 95 % CI 0.93-3.86; HR 1.83, 95 % CI 0.92-3.65, respectively).

However, epigenetic information can also influence genome evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of epigenetic information on gene sequence evolution in two disparate insects: the fly Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks substantial DNA methylation, and the ant Camponotus floridanus, which possesses a functional DNA methylation system. We found that DNA methylation was positively correlated with the synonymous substitution rate in C. floridanus, suggesting a key effect of DNA methylation on patterns of gene evolution. However, our data suggest the link between DNA methylation and elevated rates of synonymous substitution was explained, in large part, by the targeting of DNA methylation to genes with signatures of transcriptionally active chromatin, rather than the mutational effect of DNA methylation itself. This phenomenon may be explained by an elevated mutation rate for genes residing in transcriptionally active chromatin, or by increased structural constraints on genes in inactive chromatin. This result highlights the importance of chromatin structure as the primary epigenetic driver of genome evolution in insects. Overall, our study demonstrates how different epigenetic systems contribute to variation in the rates of coding sequence evolution.",0,1424

We separated participants into three groups (control, short-term exposure, and long-term exposure) to investigate the influence of toluene exposure time on gene expression. We then comprehensively analyzed and investigated the correlation between variations in gene expression and the occurrence of methylation. Twenty-six genes were upregulated and hypomethylated, while 32 genes were downregulated and hypermethylated. The pathways of these genes were confirmed to be associated with cell survival and the immune system. Based on our findings, these genes can help predict the effects of time-dependent exposure to toluene on human health.

However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling metastasis genes and their role in metastatic transformation are largely unknown. To address epigenetically-regulated gene products involved in ovarian cancer metastasis, we examined the mechanisms regulating mucin 13 (MUC13) expression and its influence on aggressive behaviors of ovarian malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We injected SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells peritoneally into nude mice to mimic human ovarian tumor metastasis. Overexpression of MUC13 mRNA was detected in metastatic implants from the xenografts by expression microarray analysis and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The DNA methylation status within the MUC13 promoter region was determined using bisulfite sequencing PCR and quantitative methylation-specific PCR. We evaluated the effects of exogenous MUC13 on cell invasion and migration using in vitro transwell assays. RESULTS: MUC13 mRNA expression was up-regulated, and methylation of specific CpG sites within the promoter was reduced in the metastatic implants relative to those in wild-type SK-OV-3 cells. Addition of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor to SK-OV-3 cells induced MUC13 expression, thereby implying epigenetic regulation of MUC13 by promoter methylation. MUC13 overexpression increased migration and invasiveness, compared to control cells, suggesting aberrant up-regulation of MUC13 is strongly associated with progression of aggressive behaviors in ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: We provide novel evidence for epigenetic regulation of MUC13 in ovarian cancer. We suggest that the DNA methylation status within the MUC13 promoter region may be a potential biomarker of aggressive behavior in ovarian cancer.",1.287,1483

The aim of this study was to evaluate the methylation status of 12 cancer-related genes, namely ERCC1, hMLH1, ATM, CDKN2B (p15INK4B), p14ARF, CDKN2A (p16INK4A), RASSF1A, RUNX3, GATA6, NDRG2, PTEN, and RARbeta, in 44 meningioma samples of WHO grade I and II. METHODS: All genes were analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, while pyrosequencing (PSQ) was used to study NDRG2 promoter methylation. RESULTS: The most frequently methylated genes in both types of meningiomas were p14ARF, RASSF1A, and p15INK4B. RUNX3, GATA6, and p16INK4A were methylated to a lesser extent, whereas ATM and RARbeta were found to be methylated in a marginal number of patients. The ERCC1, hMLH1, NDRG2, and PTEN genes were unmethylated in all cases. Although tumors of the same grade according to WHO criteria had different genes methylated, the number of methylated genes for each individual patient was low. RUNX3 methylation significantly correlated with meningioma WHO grade, therefore, can be considered as a potential indicator of tumor aggressiveness. The sequence of NDRG2 chosen for PSQ analysis was found methylated in the majority of meningiomas; however, the methylation level was only slightly elevated as compared to non-cancerous brain. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of this study confirm that DNA methylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of meningiomas. Further investigations, particularly concerning RUNX3 methylation, are necessary in order to assess the clinical usefulness of the methylation analysis of the studied genes.",3.081,328

Our and other groups demonstrated that dysregulation of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) -hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway was involved in monocyte/macrophages-mediated inflammation and atherosclerosis. However, it remains unknown whether altered cse methylation in macrophages may play a role in linking CSE-H2S dysregulation and atherosclerosis. In the present study, we showed that plasma H2S and H2S production in the peritoneal macrophages of apolipoprotein knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice gradually decreased with ages, and were also lower than that in control mice at 12 weeks older. Moreover, CSE mRNA expressions decreased while DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expressions increased in the peritoneal macrophages isolated from apoE(-/-) mice, compared to age-matched wildtype mice. Similar observations were obtained in an in vitro study. In oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-treated raw264.7 macrophages, cse transcription was down-regulated while the expression and activity of DNMT was up-regulated, associated with enhanced DNA methylation in cse promoter. Suppression of DNMT with its inhibitor or siRNA reversed the decrease of CSE mRNA. Therefore, our data suggest that DNA hypermethylation of CpG rich region in cse promoter might contribute to the decrease of cse transcription and H2S production in macrophages, and thus contribute to atherosclerosis development.",2.297,306

The epigenetic mechanism of gene methylation provides a putative link between nutrition, one-carbon metabolism, and disease progression because folate deficiency may cause hypomethylation of promoter regions in AD-relevant genes. We hypothesized that folic acid supplementation may protect neuron cells from amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer-induced toxicity by modulating DNA methylation of APP and PS1 in AD models. METHODS: Primary hippocampal neuronal cells and hippocampal HT-22 cells were incubated for 24 h with a combination of folic acid and either Abeta oligomers or vehicle and were then incubated for 72 h with various concentrations of folic acid. AD transgenic mice were fed either folate-deficient or control diets and gavaged daily with various doses of folic acid (0 or 600 mug/kg). DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, cell viability, methylation potential of cells, APP and PS1 expression, and the methylation of the respective promoters were determined. RESULTS: Abeta oligomers lowered DNMT activity, increased PS1 and APP expression, and decreased cell viability. Folic acid dose-dependently stimulated methylation potential and DNMT activity, altered PS1 and APP promoter methylation, decreased PS1 and APP expression, and partially preserved cell viability. Folic acid increased PS1 and APP promoter methylation in AD transgenic mice.

Using a proliferative in vitro placental model, the effect of DNA methylation loss on gene activation was evaluated at a number of genes selected for being differentially methylated in pre-eclampsia-associated placentae in vivo. We aimed to determine whether reduced DNA methylation at specific loci was associated with transcriptional changes at the corresponding gene, thus providing mechanistic underpinnings for previous clinical findings and to assess the degree of transcriptional response amongst our candidate genes. BeWo and JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells were exposed to 1 muM 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) or vehicle control for 48 h, and re-plated and cultured for a further 72 h in normal media before cells were harvested for RNA and DNA. Bisulphite pyrosequencing confirmed that DNA methylation was reduced by  approximately 30-50% points at the selected loci studied in both cell lines. Gene activation, measured by qRT-PCR, was highly variable and transcript specific, indicating differential sensitivity to DNA methylation. Most notably, loss of DNA methylation at the leptin (LEP) promoter corresponded to a 200-fold and 40-fold increase in LEP expression in BeWo and JEG3 cells, respectively (P < 0.01). Transcripts of steroidogenic pathway enzymes CYP11A1 and HSD3B1 were up-regulated  approximately 40-fold in response to 5-Aza-CdR exposure in BeWo cells (P < 0.01). Other transcripts, including aromatase (CYP19), HSD11B2, inhibin (INHBA) and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) were more moderately, although significantly, affected by loss of associated DNA methylation.

The placenta is the only organ that has a transient life of 9 months and undergoes rapid growth and dynamic structural and functional changes across gestation. Additionally, the placenta is unique because although developing within the mother, its genome is identical to that of the foetus. Given these distinctive characteristics, it is not surprising that the epigenetic landscape affecting placental gene expression may be different to that in other healthy tissues. However, the role of epigenetic modifications, and particularly DNA methylation, in placental development remains largely unknown. Of particular interest is the fact that the placenta is the most hypomethylated human tissue and is characterized by the presence of large partially methylated domains (PMDs) containing silenced genes. Moreover, how and why the placenta is hypomethylated and what role DNA methylation plays in regulating placental gene expression across gestation are poorly understood. We review genome-wide DNA methylation studies in the human placenta and highlight that the different cell types that make up the placenta have very different DNA methylation profiles. Summarizing studies on DNA methylation in the placenta and its relationship with pregnancy complications are difficult due to the limited number of studies available for comparison. To understand the key steps in placental development and hence what may be perturbed in pregnancy complications requires large-scale genome-wide DNA methylation studies coupled with transcriptome analyses.",0,1401

METHODS: In total, 60 elderly subjects were supplemented for 1 year with either vitamin B12, B6, folate, vitamin D and calcium (group A n = 31) or only vitamin D and calcium (group B n = 29). LINE-1 methylation, relative telomere length (T/S), vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine (tHcy) , 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), cystathionine and vitamin D were quantified before and after supplementation. RESULTS: At baseline, tHcy was high, vitamin D was low, and T/S did not differ between groups A and B. Vitamin supplementation increased LINE-1 methylation in group A at site 317 but reduced LINE-1 methylation in group B at site 327. There was no correlation between T/S and LINE-1 methylation at baseline. Multiple backward regression analysis revealed baseline tHcy and 5-methylTHF are significant predictors of T/S. After supplementation in group B but not in group A, LINE-1 methylation correlated inversely with T/S, and LINE-1 methylation variation was an independent predictor of T/S variation. B vitamins decreased tHcy significantly in group A. Multiple backward regression analysis showed 5-methylTHF in group A and tHcy in group B were significant predictors for LINE-1 methylation. At baseline, the lower LINE-1 methylation observed in subjects with 5-methylTHF >10 nmol/l was in agreement with a reduced methyl group transfer due to a lower SAM formation. In group B, an increase in telomere length was correlated with lower LINE-1 methylation. Subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia >12 micromol/L had compared to those with normal tHcy a reduced LINE-1 methylation accompanied by a higher SAM and SAH (that inhibits demethylation of SAM) as well as lower 5-methylTHF. Additionally, subjects with tHcy > 12 micromol/L had longer telomeres when compared with subjects having tHcy < 12 micromol/L. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a possible effect of B vitamins for telomere biology in blood cells. Suboptimal B vitamins status and hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with altered DNA methylation and telomere length. These data have to be confirmed in future studies.",3.467,440

Waste generated during dental procedures enters the sewer system and contributes a significant fraction of the total mercury (tHg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) load to wastewater treatment facilities. Investigating the influence of geochemical factors and microbiome structure is a critical step linking the methylating microorganisms in dental wastewater (DWW) ecosystems. DWW samples from a dental clinic were collected over eight weeks and analyzed for geochemical parameters, tHg, MeHg and bacterio-toxic heavy metals. We employed bacterial fingerprinting and pyrosequencing for microbiome analysis. High concentrations of tHg, MeHg and heavy metals were detected in DWW. The microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and many unclassified bacteria. Significant correlations were found between the bacterial community, Hg levels and geochemical factors including pH and the predicted total amount (not fraction) of neutral Hg-sulfide species. The most prevalent known methylators included Desulfobulbus propionicus, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Desulfovibrio magneticus and Geobacter sulfurreducens. This study is the first to investigate the impact of high loads of Hg, MeHg and other heavy metals on the dental clinic wastewater microbiome, and illuminates the role of many known and unknown sulfate-reducing bacteria in Hg methylation.",5.578,1029

In addition to 5-methylcytosine (5mC), some bacterial species contain in their genome N(4) -methylcytosine (N4mC). Methylation at C5 has been shown to enhance the formation of pyrimidine dimeric photoproducts but nothing is known of the effect of N4 methylation on UV-induced DNA damage. In the present work, we compared the yield and the nature of bipyrimidine photoproducts induced in a series of trinucleotides exhibiting a TXG sequence where X is either T, C, 5mC or N4mC. HPLC associated to tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), (6-4) photoproducts (64PP) and their Dewar valence isomer. Methylation at position N4 was found to drastically increase the reactivity of C upon exposure to both UVC and UVB and to favor the formation of 64PP. In contrast methylation at C5 increased the yield of CPD at the expense of 64PP. In addition, enhancement of photoreactivity by C5 methylation was much higher in the UVB than in the UVC range. These results show the drastic effect of the methylation site on the photochemistry of cytosine.",2.266,124

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genome-wide methylation profiling was performed on 33 tumors and 3 normal glioblastoma samples using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray. Cluster analysis was carried out in these samples according to the differentiated methylated genes. DNA methylation of selected significant candidates was subsequently validated to analyze the association of methylation status of these genes with overall survival as well as gene expression. RESULTS: We found 217 hypermethylated CpG sites located in 210 respective genes with significant differences in short- and long-term survival (STS and LTS) samples (P < 0.01). Cluster analysis revealed fine clustering of genes with LTS and STS. Of these, we selected 10 most hypermethylated genes, including IL11, RRAD, MS4A6A, SNAPC2, ALDH1A3, ADCY1, MMS19L, NDUFB8, POMC, and THSD4, to perform cluster analysis. It came out with the same fine classification and with survival time of these patients. The top ranking genes were further examined to compare their methylation status with the overall survival rate of patients, as well as with gene expression levels. CONCLUSION: We obtained a featured global profiling of DNA methylation in glioblastoma. Our findings strongly indicate that epigenetic silencing of IL11, RRAD, MS4A6A, SNAPC2, and ALDH1A3 are common events in glioblastoma which could be used as novel biomarkers for the prognosis of glioblastoma.",0.791,766

PfPMT methylates phosphoethanolamine (pEA) to phosphocholine for use in membrane biogenesis. Quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations tested the proposed reaction mechanism for methylation of pEA involving the previously identified Tyr-19-His-132 dyad, which indicated an energetically unfavorable mechanism. Instead, the QM/MM calculations suggested an alternative mechanism involving Asp-128. The reaction coordinate involves the stepwise transfer of a proton to Asp-128 via a bridging water molecule followed by a typical Sn2-type methyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine to pEA. Functional analysis of the D128A, D128E, D128Q, and D128N PfPMT mutants shows a loss of activity with pEA but not with the final substrate of the methylation pathway. X-ray crystal structures of the PfPMT-D128A mutant in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine and either pEA or phosphocholine reveal how mutation of Asp-128 disrupts a hydrogen bond network in the active site. The combined QM/MM, biochemical, and structural studies identify a key role for Asp-128 in the initial step of the phosphobase methylation pathway in Plasmodium and provide molecular insight on the evolution of multiple activities in the active site of the PMT.",0,893

Several molecular and epigenetic markers have been identified that predict tumor progression. Our aim was in detail to investigate the genetic and epigenetic background of LGGs and to identify new markers that might play a role in tumor behavior. Twenty-three patients with oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma (LGO) and 22 patients with diffuse astrocytoma (LGA) were investigated using several molecular-cytogenetic and molecular methods to assess their copy number variations, mutational status and level of promoter methylation. The most frequent findings were a 1p/19q codeletion in 83% of LGO and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) of 17p in 72% of LGA. Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/IDH2) genes were detected in 96% of LGO and 91% of LGA. The O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter was methylated in 83% of LGO and 59% of LGA. MutL homolog 3 (MLH3) promoter methylation was observed in 61% of LGO and 27% of LGA. Methylation of the MGMT promoter, 1p/19q codeletion, mutated IDH1, and CN-LOH of 17p were the most frequent genetic aberrations in LGGs. The findings were more diverse in LGA than in LGO.

In recent years, the methylation of non-histone proteins has emerged as a prevalent modification which impacts on diverse processes such as cell cycle control, DNA repair, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis and tumourigenesis. Many of these non-histone targets represent transcription factors, cell signalling molecules and tumour suppressor proteins. Evidence now suggests that the dysregulation of methyltransferases, demethylases and reader proteins is involved in the development of many diseases, including cancer, and several of these proteins represent potential therapeutic targets for small molecule compounds, fuelling a recent surge in chemical inhibitor design.

Methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction and SYBR Green reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the methylation status and the mRNA expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), O6methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT), the tumor suppressor genes P73, P53, GADD45G, CHFR and THBS1, the transcription factor CEBPA, the protooncogenes KRAS, NRAS and Cmyc and EGFR in 24 nasal tumor tissue samples and 20 normal nasal epithelia tissue samples. The associations between promoter methylation and DNMT, and promoter methylation and mRNA expression of the genes were analyzed. The results indicated that the expression levels of DNMT1 increased by 56% compared with those in normal nasal epithelial tissues, while MGMT, DNMT3a and DNMT3b had similar expression levels in the two tissue types. The expression levels of P53 decreased by 36.8% and those of THBS1 by 43%, while Cmyc increased by 2.9fold and CEBPA by 2fold compared with that in normal nasal epithelial tissues. GADD45G, P73, CHFR and NRAS were observed to have similar expression levels in the two tissue types. However, no expression was observed for EGFR and KRAS. CHFR, GADD45G and THBS1 were identified to be methylated in tumor suppressor genes. The methylation expression rate of the CHFR gene was ~60% in the two tissue types and for THBS1 it was 100% in the nasal tumor tissues as opposed to 20% in the normal nasal epithelial tissues. The exhaustive methylation expression rate of GADD45G was 62.5% and the partial methylation expression rate was 37.5% in nasal tumor tissue, while no methylation was observed in normal nasal epithelial tissues. Cmyc was the only gene identified to be methylated amongst protooncogenes. The methylation expression rate of Cmyc was 87.5% in nasal tumor tissues and 15% in normal nasal epithelial tissues. The methylation expression rate of CEBPA was 100% in nasal tumor tissues and 40% in normal nasal epithelial tissues. The methylation expression rate of the EGFR gene was ~80% in the two tissues. In summary, the present study identified abnormal methylation of the Cmyc, CEBPA, GADD45G and THBS1 genes in nasal tumor tissues. The expression levels of DNMT1, Cmyc and CEBPA were upregulated and the expression of P53 and THBSI were downregulated in nasal tumor tissues, with a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). Therefore, it is suggested that these six genes may be used as diagnostic marker candidates for ENT. The results may serve as a foundation for screening of tumorspecific markers for early diagnosis of ENT and further investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV)induced nasal epithelium cell carcinoma.",1.554,274

However, the mechanisms underlying paternal epigenetic transmission are unclear. Unlike in somatic cells, there are few nucleosomes in sperm, and their function in epigenetic inheritance is unknown. We generated transgenic mice in which overexpression of the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase KDM1A (also known as LSD1) during spermatogenesis reduced H3K4 dimethylation in sperm. KDM1A overexpression in one generation severely impaired development and survivability of offspring. These defects persisted transgenerationally in the absence of KDM1A germline expression and were associated with altered RNA profiles in sperm and offspring. We show that epigenetic inheritance of aberrant development can be initiated by histone demethylase activity in developing sperm, without changes to DNA methylation at CpG-rich regions.",0,648
27541340,Global DNA Methylation Detection System Using MBD-Fused Luciferase Based on Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Assay.,[],Analytical chemistry,2016,"DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. In normal cells, transposable elements that constitute approximately 45% of the human genome are highly methylated to silence their expression. In cancer cells, transposable elements are hypomethylated; therefore, global DNA methylation level is considered as a biomarker for cancer diagnostics. In this study, a homogeneous assay for measuring global DNA methylation level based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) was developed using methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD)-fused luciferase. In this assay, the MBD-luciferase recognizes methylated CpG, thus BRET between the luciferase and fluorescent DNA intercalating dye is detected. We demonstrated that the BRET signal depended on the DNA methylation level of the target DNA. Moreover, the BRET signal was correlated with the LINE1 DNA methylation level on human genomic DNA, as determined by the bisulfite method. These results indicate that the global DNA methylation level of human genomic DNA could be detected simply by measuring the BRET signal.",5.636,1928

Distinguishing the impact of these 2 exposures is challenging and raises critical questions about whether pharmacological, genetic, or epigenetic factors can explain the spectrum of reported outcomes. Using unbiased DNA methylation array measurements followed by a detailed candidate gene approach, we examined whether prenatal SRI exposure was associated with neonatal DNA methylation changes and whether such changes were associated with differences in birth outcomes. Prenatal SRI exposure was first associated with increased DNA methylation status primarily at CYP2E1(beta(Non-exposed) = 0.06, beta(SRI-exposed) = 0.30, FDR = 0); however, this finding could not be distinguished from the potential impact of prenatal maternal depressed mood. Then, using pyrosequencing of CYP2E1 regulatory regions in an expanded cohort, higher DNA methylation status--both the mean across 16 CpG sites (P < 0.01) and at each specific CpG site (P < 0.05)--was associated with exposure to lower 3rd trimester maternal depressed mood symptoms only in the SRI-exposed neonates, indicating a maternal mood x SRI exposure interaction. In addition, higher DNA methylation levels at CpG2 (P = 0.04), CpG9 (P = 0.04) and CpG10 (P = 0.02), in the interrogated CYP2E1 region, were associated with increased birth weight independently of prenatal maternal mood, SRI drug exposure, or gestational age at birth. Prenatal SRI antidepressant exposure and maternal depressed mood were associated with altered neonatal CYP2E1 DNA methylation status, which, in turn, appeared to be associated with birth weight.",4.78,1658

Here we examined the correlation between obesity and insulin resistance with the methylation frequency of the leptin (LEP) and adiponectin (ADIPOQ) promoters in obese adolescents with the aim to identify epigenetic markers that might be used as tools to predict and follow up the physiological alterations associated with the development of the metabolic syndrome. SUBJECTS: One hundred and six adolescents were recruited and classified according to body mass index and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance index. The circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and of several metabolic markers of obesity and insulin resistance were determined by standard methods. The methylation frequency of the LEP and ADIPOQ promoters was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) in DNA obtained from peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: Obese adolescents without insulin resistance showed higher and lower circulating levels of, respectively, leptin and adiponectin along with increased plasmatic concentrations of insulin and triglycerides. They also exhibited the same methylation frequency than lean subjects of the CpG sites located at -51 and -31 nt relative to the transcription start site of the LEP gene. However, the methylation frequency of these nucleotides dropped markedly in obese adolescents with insulin resistance. We found the same inverse relationship between the combined presence of obesity and insulin resistance and the methylation frequency of the CpG site located at -283 nt relative to the start site of the ADIPOQ promoter. CONCLUSIONS: These observations sustain the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications might underpin the development of obesity and related metabolic disorders. They also validate the use of blood leukocytes and MS-PCR as a reliable and affordable methodology for the identification of epigenetic modifications that could be used as molecular markers to predict and follow up the physiological changes associated with obesity and insulin resistance.",3.313,1970

The dopamine system plays a role in substance use, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an important enzyme that degrades dopamine. The Val(108/158) Met polymorphism modulates COMT activity and thus dopamine levels, and has been linked to substance use. COMT gene methylation, on the other hand, may affect expression and thus indirectly COMT activity. We investigated whether methylation of the COMT gene was associated with adolescents' substance use. Furthermore, we explored whether the COMT Val(108/158) Met polymorphism interacts with COMT gene methylation in association with substance use. In 463 adolescents (mean age=16, 50.8% girls), substance use (cigarette smoking, alcohol and cannabis use) was assessed with self-report questionnaires. From blood samples, COMT Val(108/158) Met genotype and methylation rates of membrane bound (MB) and soluble (S) COMT promoters were assessed. MB-COMT promoter methylation was associated with non-daily smoking [odds ratio (OR)=1.82, P=0.03], but not with daily smoking (OR=1.20, P=0.34), MB-COMT promoter methylation was not associated with alcohol use. Adolescents with the Met/Met genotype and high rates of MB-COMT promoter methylation were less likely to be high-frequent cannabis users than adolescents with the Val/Val or Val/Met genotype. S-COMT promoter methylation was not associated with substance use. These results indicate that there is an association between substance use and COMT gene methylation. Although this association is complex, combining genetic and epigenetic variation of the COMT gene may be helpful in further elucidating the influence of the dopamine system on substance use in adolescence.",3.661,1464

We therefore interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation using HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays in 21 primary HG-NMIBC tumors relative to normal bladder controls. Using strict inclusion-exclusion criteria we identified 1,057 hypermethylated CpGs within gene promoter-associated CpG islands, representing 256 genes. We validated the array data by bisulphite pyrosequencing and examined 25 array-identified candidate genes in an independent cohort of 30 HG-NMIBC and 18 low-intermediate-grade NMIBC. These analyses revealed significantly higher methylation frequencies in high-grade tumors relative to low-intermediate-grade tumors for the ATP5G2, IRX1 and VAX2 genes (P<0.05), and similarly significant increases in mean levels of methylation in high-grade tumors for the ATP5G2, VAX2, INSRR, PRDM14, VSX1, TFAP2b, PRRX1, and HIST1H4F genes (P<0.05).

This deficiency contributes functionally to the fibroproliferative state, however the mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined whether the reduced level of COX-2 mRNA expression observed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts is regulated epigenetically. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA) restored COX-2 mRNA expression by fibrotic lung fibroblasts dose dependently. Functionally, this resulted in normalization of fibroblast phenotype in terms of PGE2 production, collagen mRNA expression and sensitivity to apoptosis. COX-2 methylation assessed by bisulfite sequencing and methylation microarrays was not different in fibrotic fibroblasts compared with controls. However, further analysis of the methylation array data identified a transcriptional regulator, chromosome 8 open reading frame 4 (thyroid cancer protein 1, TC-1) (c8orf4), which is hypermethylated and down-regulated in fibrotic fibroblasts compared with controls. siRNA knockdown of c8orf4 in control fibroblasts down-regulated COX-2 and PGE2 production generating a phenotype similar to that observed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c8orf4 regulates COX-2 expression in lung fibroblasts through binding of the proximal promoter. We conclude that the decreased capacity of fibrotic lung fibroblasts to up-regulate COX-2 expression and COX-2-derived PGE2 synthesis is due to an indirect epigenetic mechanism involving hypermethylation of the transcriptional regulator, c8orf4.",0,183

The abnormalities in DNA methylation can occur in various types of cancer and some genetic diseases. The measurement of DNA methylation is therefore important and there is a range of methodologies used to detect DNA methylation. Many methods based on bisulfite treatment appeared with a lack of specificity after recent discoveries of various modifications of methylated cytosine, however there are new treatments developed to overcome this limitation. Immunofluorescence is currently known to be able to specifically detect DNA methylation as it uses different antibodies against 5meC and its derivatives, but it is a semi-quantitative method. Immunofluorescence protocols commonly include fixation of cells followed by permeabilisation, antigen retrieval, and treatments with antibodies. Establishing the strategy for antigen retrieval of immunofluorescence is important to unmask epitopes (i.e. 5meC) from other proteins, and therefore to access the antigen of interest. There are many approaches used for antigen retrieval induced by acid, enzyme and/or heat. The selection of antigen retrieval method can depend on a variety of such antigen-based or cell-based conditions, since the dynamic structure of DNA and chromatin accounts for the complexity of involved proteins to mask the epitope. This review aims to specifically focus on the complexity of in situ detection of DNA methylation by immunofluorescence-based methods using antigen retrieval with the current understanding of DNA methylation mechanism, and suggests conditions for antigenic retrieval of 5meC epitope.",1.82,794

Here we show that reverting PGCs to EGCs involved stable ICC methylation erasure at Snrpn, Igf2r, and Kcnqot1. In contrast, the H19/Igf2 ICC undergoes erasure followed by de novo re-methylation. PGCs differentiated in vitro from ESCs completed Snrpn ICC erasure. However, the hypomethylated state is highly unstable. We also discovered that when the H19/Igf2 ICC was abnormally hypermethylated in ESCs, this is not erased in PGCs differentiated from ESCs. Therefore, launching PGC differentiation from ESC lines with appropriately methylated ICCs is critical to the generation of germline cells that recapitulate endogenous ICC erasure.",5.365,1607
27084945,Protection of CpG islands from DNA methylation is DNA-encoded and evolutionarily conserved.,"['Long HK', 'King HW', 'Patient RK', 'Odom DT', 'Klose RJ']",Nucleic acids research,2016,"DNA methylation is a repressive epigenetic modification that covers vertebrate genomes. Regions known as CpG islands (CGIs), which are refractory to DNA methylation, are often associated with gene promoters and play central roles in gene regulation. Yet how CGIs in their normal genomic context evade the DNA methylation machinery and whether these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved remains enigmatic. To address these fundamental questions we exploited a transchromosomic animal model and genomic approaches to understand how the hypomethylated state is formed in vivo and to discover whether mechanisms governing CGI formation are evolutionarily conserved. Strikingly, insertion of a human chromosome into mouse revealed that promoter-associated CGIs are refractory to DNA methylation regardless of host species, demonstrating that DNA sequence plays a central role in specifying the hypomethylated state through evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. In contrast, elements distal to gene promoters exhibited more variable methylation between host species, uncovering a widespread dependence on nucleotide frequency and occupancy of DNA-binding transcription factors in shaping the DNA methylation landscape away from gene promoters. This was exemplified by young CpG rich lineage-restricted repeat sequences that evaded DNA methylation in the absence of co-evolved mechanisms targeting methylation to these sequences, and species specific DNA binding events that protected against DNA methylation in CpG poor regions. Finally, transplantation of mouse chromosomal fragments into the evolutionarily distant zebrafish uncovered the existence of a mechanistically conserved and DNA-encoded logic which shapes CGI formation across vertebrate species.",9.112,803

Definition of the oocyte DNA methylome by whole genome approaches revealed that the majority of methylated CpG islands are intragenic and gene bodies are hypermethylated. Yet, the mechanisms by which transcription regulates DNA methylation in oocytes remain unclear. Here, we systematically test the link between transcription and the methylome. RESULTS: We perform deep RNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly at different stages of mouse oogenesis. This reveals thousands of novel non-annotated genes, as well as alternative promoters, for approximately 10 % of reference genes expressed in oocytes. In addition, a large fraction of novel promoters coincide with MaLR and ERVK transposable elements. Integration with our transcriptome assembly reveals that transcription correlates accurately with DNA methylation and accounts for approximately 85-90 % of the methylome. We generate a mouse model in which transcription across the Zac1/Plagl1 locus is abrogated in oocytes, resulting in failure of DNA methylation establishment at all CpGs of this locus. ChIP analysis in oocytes reveals H3K4me2 enrichment at the Zac1 imprinted control region when transcription is ablated, establishing a connection between transcription and chromatin remodeling at CpG islands by histone demethylases. CONCLUSIONS: By precisely defining the mouse oocyte transcriptome, this work not only highlights transcription as a cornerstone of DNA methylation establishment in female germ cells, but also provides an important resource for developmental biology research.",10.81,925

 Toxicology",2015,"MDMA (ecstasy) is an illicit drug that stimulates monoamine neurotransmitter release and inhibits reuptake. MDMA's acute cardiotoxicity includes tachycardia and arrhythmia which are associated with cardiomyopathy. MDMA acute cardiotoxicity has been explored, but neither long-term MDMA cardiac pathological changes nor epigenetic changes have been evaluated. Microarray analyses were employed to identify cardiac gene expression changes and epigenetic DNA methylation changes. To identify permanent MDMA-induced pathogenetic changes, mice received daily 10- or 35-day MDMA, or daily 10-day MDMA followed by 25-day saline washout (10 + 25 days). MDMA treatment caused differential gene expression (p < .05, fold change >1.5) in 752 genes following 10 days, 558 genes following 35 days, and 113 genes following 10-day MDMA + 25-day saline washout. Changes in MAPK and circadian rhythm gene expression were identified as early as 10 days. After 35 days, circadian rhythm genes (Per3, CLOCK, ARNTL, and NPAS2) persisted to be differentially expressed. MDMA caused DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation that was independent of gene expression; hypermethylation of genes was found to be 71% at 10 days, 68% at 35 days, and 91% at 10 + 25 days washout. Differential gene expression paralleled DNA methylation in 22% of genes at 10-day treatment, 17% at 35 days, and 48% at 10 + 25 days washout. We show here that MDMA induced cardiac epigenetic changes in DNA methylation where hypermethylation predominated. Moreover, MDMA induced gene expression of key elements of circadian rhythm regulatory genes. This suggests a fundamental organism-level event to explain some of the etiologies of MDMA dysfunction in the heart.",0.825,882
26365234,A computational method for studying the relation between alternative splicing and DNA methylation.,"['Zheng Z', 'Wei X', 'Hildebrandt A', 'Schmidt B']",Nucleic acids research,2016,"Alternative splicing is an important mechanism in eukaryotes that expands the transcriptome and proteome significantly. It plays an important role in a number of biological processes. Understanding its regulation is hence an important challenge. Recently, increasing evidence has been collected that supports an involvement of intragenic DNA methylation in the regulation of alternative splicing. The exact mechanisms of regulation, however, are largely unknown, and speculated to be complex: different methylation profiles might exist, each of which could be associated with a different regulation mechanism. We present a computational technique that is able to determine such stable methylation patterns and allows to correlate these patterns with inclusion propensity of exons. Pattern detection is based on dynamic time warping (DTW) of methylation profiles, a sophisticated similarity measure for signals that can be non-trivially transformed. We design a flexible self-organizing map approach to pattern grouping. Exemplary application on available data sets indicates that stable patterns which correlate non-trivially with exon inclusion do indeed exist. To improve the reliability of these predictions, further studies on larger data sets will be required. We have thus taken great care that our software runs efficiently on modern hardware, so that it can support future studies on large-scale data sets.",9.112,988

LUMA depends on digestion of DNA with methyl-sensitive and methyl-insensitive restriction enzymes, followed by pyrosequencing. Until recently, LUMA has been principally used for biomedical research. Here, we use chickens as a model to investigate sample quality issues relating to LUMA and then apply the method to ecological species. First, we assessed the effect of tissue storage conditions on DNA methylation values. This is an important consideration for ecological species because samples are not always ideally preserved and LUMA is sensitive to poor DNA quality. We found that good quality LUMA data could be obtained from chicken liver and brain tissues stored at 21  degrees C for at least 2 and 12 h, respectively. Longer storage times introduced nonspecific peaks to pyrograms which were associated with reduced DNA methylation. Repeatedly, freezing and thawing the tissues did not affect LUMA data. Second, we measured DNA methylation in 12 species representing five animal classes: amphibians (African and Western clawed frog), reptiles (green anole lizard), fish (yellow perch, goldfish, lake trout), mammals (American mink, polar bear, short-beaked common dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin) and birds (chicken, Japanese quail). We saw a pattern of high DNA methylation in fish (84-87%), and intermediate levels in mammals (68-72%) and birds (52-71%). This pattern corresponds well with previous measures of DNA methylation generated by HPLC. Our data represent the first CpG methylation values to be reported in several species and provide a basis for studying patterns of epigenetic inheritance in an ecological context.",3.712,1486

However, clinical performance of methylation markers can be influenced by the sample type utilized. We describe a multiplex quantitative methylation-specific PCR that targets FAM19A4 and mir124-2 loci, to detect CIN3+ using both HPV-positive lavage- and brush self-samples. METHODS: We determined methylation thresholds for clinical classification using HPV-positive training sets comprising lavage self-samples of 182 women (including 40 with CIN3+) and brush self-samples of 224 women (including 61 with CIN3+). Subsequently, independent HPV-positive validation sets of 389 lavage self-samples (including 78 with CIN3+), and 254 brush self-samples (including 72 with CIN3+) were tested using the preset thresholds. Furthermore, the clinical performance of combined methylation analysis and HPV16/18 genotyping was determined. RESULTS: Training set analysis revealed similar FAM19A4 and mir124-2 thresholds for both self-sample types to yield highest CIN3+ sensitivity at 70% specificity. Validation set analysis resulted in a CIN3+ sensitivity of 70.5% (95%CI: 60.4-80.6) at a specificity of 67.8% (95%CI: 62.7-73.0) for lavage self-samples, and a CIN3+ sensitivity of 69.4% (95%CI: 58.8-80.1) at a 76.4% (95%CI: 70.2-82.6) specificity for brush self-samples.

We evaluated global DNA methylation status in 49 EBVaGC and 45 EBV-negative gastric carcinoma (EBVnGC) tissue samples and cell lines by 5-methylcytosine immunohistochemical staining and methylation quantification. We determined promoter methylation status and protein expression for the p16, FHIT, CRBP1, WWOX, and DLC-1 genes in tissues and studied the correlation between CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) class and clinicopathological characteristics. Changes in gene methylation and mRNA expression in EBVaGC cell line SNU-719 and in EBVnGC cell lines SGC-7901, BGC-823, and AGS were assessed after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), trichostatin A (TSA), or a combination of both, by methylation-specific PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Global genomic DNA hypomethylation was more pronounced in EBVnGC than in EBVaGC. Promoter methylation of all five genes was more frequent in EBVaGC than in EBVnGC (p < 0.05). p16 and FHIT methylation was reversely correlated with protein expression in EBVaGC. Most (41/49) EBVaGC exhibited CIMP-high (CIMP-H), and the prognosis of CIMP-H patients was significantly worse than that of CIMP-low (p = 0.027) and CIMP-none (p = 0.003) patients. Treatment with 5-aza-dC and/or TSA induced upregulation of RNA expression of all five genes in SNU-719; meanwhile, individual gene expression increased in EBVnGC cell lines. In summary, EBV-induced hypermethylation of p16, FHIT, CRBP1, WWOX, and DLC-1 may contribute to EBVaGC development. Demethylation therapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for EBVaGC.",0,736

In 2010, 249 twenty-years-old volunteers whose mothers had participated in a study association between birth weight (BW) and nutrition during pregnancy in 1990, were invited to take part in our present study. In this study, the LINE-1 and Alu methylation levels and patterns were measured in peripheral mononuclear cells and correlated with various nutritional parameters during intrauterine and postnatal period of offspring. This included the amount of maternal intake during pregnancy, the mother's weight gain during pregnancy, birth weight, birth length, and the rate of weight gain in the first year of life. Catch-up growth (CUG) was defined when weight during the first year was >0.67 of the standard score, according to WHO data. No association with LINE-1 methylation was identified. The mean level of Alu methylation in the CUG group was significantly higher than those non-CUG (39.61% and 33.66 % respectively, P < 0.0001). The positive correlation between the history of CUG in the first year and higher Alu methylation indicates the role of Alu methylation, not only in aging cells, but also in the human growth process.

The status of APN promoter methylation was detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), while the mRNA expression level of APN was detected by RT-PCR. Results show that methylation positive rate of APN was at the lowest level in control, middel in obesity and highest in T2DM groups, and the differences are statistically significant. Comparing the APN mRNA relative copy number of adipose tissue in each group, we found that the relative copy number of APN in control group is significantly higher than that of obesity and T2DM groups. There is a negative correlation between the mRNA expression level of APN in abdominal adipose tissue and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and triglyceride (TG) level. There is a negative correlation in DNA promoter methylation and mRNA expression of APN gene. Relative copy number of APN in DNA methylation positive group is significantly lower than that of the negative group. In conclusion, increased APN promoter methylation results in decreased mRNA expression, which induces glucose and lipid metabolic disorder, thus contributing to the initiation and development of T2DM in Xinjiang Uygur population.",0,1317

It is important to distinguish whether these tumours are de novo or recurrences of the primary tumour in order to guide the appropriate therapy. Our aim was to investigate the use of DNA methylation profiling and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine whether the second tumour is clonally related to the first tumour. METHODS: Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting was used to screen promoter methylation in a panel of 13 genes reported as methylated in breast cancer (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, CDH13, RARbeta, BRCA1, CDH1, CDKN2A, TP73, and GSTP1) in 29 tumour pairs (16 ipsilateral and 13 contralateral). Using the methylation profile of these genes, we employed a Bayesian and an empirical statistical approach to estimate clonal relationship. Copy number alterations were analysed using aCGH on the same set of tumour pairs. RESULTS: There is a higher probability of the second tumour being recurrent in ipsilateral tumours compared with contralateral tumours (38 % versus 8 %; p <0.05) based on the methylation profile. Using previously reported recurrence rates as Bayesian prior probabilities, we classified 69 % of ipsilateral and 15 % of contralateral tumours as recurrent. The inferred clonal relationship results of the tumour pairs were generally concordant between methylation profiling and aCGH. CONCLUSION: Our results show that DNA methylation profiling as well as aCGH have potential as diagnostic tools in improving the clinical decisions to differentiate recurrences from a second de novo tumour.",3.362,272

METHODS: First, we used cord blood of 129 Dutch children exposed to maternal smoking vs 126 unexposed to maternal and paternal smoking (53% male) participating in the GECKO Drenthe birth cohort. DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. We performed an epigenome-wide association study for the association between maternal smoking and methylation followed by a mediation analysis of the top signals [false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. We adjusted both analyses for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, offspring's sex, gestational age and white blood cell composition. Secondly, in 175 exposed and 1248 unexposed newborns from two independent birth cohorts, we replicated and meta-analysed results of eight cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in the GFI1 gene, which showed the most robust mediation. Finally, we performed functional network and enrichment analysis. RESULTS: We found 35 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05) in newborns exposed vs unexposed to smoking, of which 23 survived Bonferroni correction (P < 1 x 10(-7)). These 23 CpGs mapped to eight genes: AHRR, GFI1, MYO1G, CYP1A1, NEUROG1, CNTNAP2, FRMD4A and LRP5. We observed partial confirmation as three of the eight CpGs in GFI1 replicated. These CpGs partly mediated the effect of maternal smoking on birthweight (Sobel P < 0.05) in meta-analysis of GECKO and the two replication cohorts. Differential methylation of these three GFI1 CpGs explained 12-19% of the 202 g lower birthweight in smoking mothers. Functional enrichment analysis pointed towards activation of cell-mediated immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with cord blood methylation differences.

Indian traditional system practices personalized medicine through indigenous concept of distinctly descriptive physiological, psychological and anatomical features known as prakriti. Here we attempted to establish DNA methylation differences in these three prakriti phenotypes. METHODS: Following structured and objective measurement of 3416 subjects, whole blood DNA of 147 healthy male individuals belonging to defined prakriti (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) between the age group of 20-30years were subjected to methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and microarray analysis. After data analysis, prakriti specific signatures were validated through bisulfite DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Differentially methylated regions in CpG islands and shores were significantly enriched in promoters/UTRs and gene body regions. Phenotypes characterized by higher metabolism (Pitta prakriti) in individuals showed distinct promoter (34) and gene body methylation (204), followed by Vata prakriti which correlates to motion showed DNA methylation in 52 promoters and 139 CpG islands and finally individuals with structural attributes (Kapha prakriti) with 23 and 19 promoters and CpG islands respectively. Bisulfite DNA sequencing of prakriti specific multiple CpG sites in promoters and 5'-UTR such as; LHX1 (Vata prakriti), SOX11 (Pitta prakriti) and CDH22 (Kapha prakriti) were validated.

We sought to establish the association between them, as well as to analyze the DNA aberrant methylation in sputum and in bronchial washings (BW). METHODS: Cross sectional study of high risk patients for lung cancer in whom induced sputum and autofluorescence bronchoscopy were performed. The molecular analysis was determined on DAPK1, RASSF1A and p16 genes using Methylation-specific PCR. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were enrolled in the study. Dysplasia lesions were found in 79 patients (61.7%) and high grade dysplasia in 20 (15.6%). Ninety eight patients out of 128 underwent molecular analysis. Methylation was observed in bronchial secretions (sputum or BW) in 60 patients (61.2%), 51 of them (52%) for DAPK1, in 20 (20.4%) for p16 and in three (3.1%) for RASSF1A. Methylated genes only found in sputum accounted for 38.3% and only in BW in 41.7%, and in both 20.0%. In the 11.2% of the patients studied, HGD and a hypermethylated gene were present, while for the 55.1% of the sample only one of both was detected and for the rest of the subjects (33.6%), none of the risk factors were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data determines DNA aberrant methylation panel in bronchial secretions is present in a 61.2% and HGD is found in 15.6%. Although both parameters have previously been identified as risk factors for lung cancer, the current study does not find a significative association between them.

 Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine",2016,"Epigenetic alterations in the methylome have been associated with tumor development and progression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In this study, 45 tumor samples, 12 tumor-free kidney cortex tissues, and 24 peripheral blood samples from patients with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) were analyzed by genome-wide promoter-directed methylation arrays and related to clinicopathological parameters. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated the tumors into two distinct methylation groups (clusters A and B), where cluster B had higher average methylation and increased number of hypermethylated CpG sites (CpGs). Furthermore, tumors in cluster B had, compared with cluster A, a larger tumor diameter (p = 0.033), a higher morphologic grade (p < 0.001), a higher tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p < 0.001), and a worse prognosis (p = 0.005). Higher TNM stage was correlated to an increase in average methylation level (p = 0.003) and number of hypermethylated CpGs (p = 0.003), whereas a number of hypomethylated CpGs were mainly unchanged. However, the predicted age of the tumors based on methylation profile did not correlate with TNM stage, morphological grade, or methylation cluster. Differently methylated (DM) genes (n = 840) in ccRCC samples compared with tumor-free kidney cortex samples were predominantly hypermethylated and a high proportion were identified as polycomb target genes. The DM genes were overrepresented by transcription factors, ligands, and receptors, indicating functional alterations of significance for ccRCC progression. To conclude, increased number of hypermethylated genes was associated with increased TNM stage of the tumors. DNA methylation classification of ccRCC tumor samples at diagnosis can serve as a clinically applicable prognostic marker in ccRCC.",0,1261

We detected 1493 differentially expressed genes between the two groups, of which 382 genes were also differentially methylated. The results of the integrative analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression revealed that the DNA methylation levels showed a significantly negative and monotonic correlation with gene expression levels around the transcription start site of genes. By contrast, no notable monotonic correlation was observed in other regions. Furthermore, we identified some interesting genes and signalling pathways (e.g. myosin, heavy chain 7 and mammalian target of rapamycin) which possibly play essential roles in skeletal muscle growth and development. The results of this study provide insights into the relationship of DNA methylation with gene expression in newborn piglets and into the mechanisms in abnormally cloned animals through somatic cell nuclear transfer.",2.207,1231
25389047,A novel imprinted transgene located near a repetitive element that exhibits allelic imbalance in DNA methylation during early development.,"['Uchiyama K', 'Watanabe D', 'Hayasaka M', 'Hanaoka K']","Development, growth & differentiation",2014,"A mouse line carrying a lacZ transgene driven by the human EEF1A1/EF1 alpha promoter was established. Although the promoter is known to show ubiquitous activity, only paternal transgene alleles were expressed, resulting in a transgene imprinting. At mid-gestation, the promoter sequence was differentially methylated, hypomethylated for paternal and hypermethylated for maternal alleles. In germline, the promoter was a typical differentially methylated region. After fertilization, however, both alleles were hypermethylated. Thus, the differential methylation of the promoter required for transgene imprinting was re-established during later embryonic development independently of the germline differential methylation. Furthermore, also a retroelement promoter closely-flanking imprinted transgene and its wild type counterpart displayed similar differential methylation during early development. The retroelement promoter was methylated differentially also in germline, but in an opposite pattern to the embryonic differential methylation. These results suggest that there might be an unknown epigenetic regulation inducing transgene imprinting independently of DNA methylation in the transgene insertion site. Then, besides CpG dinucleotides, non-CpG cytosines of the retroelement promoter were highly methylated especially in the transgene-active mid-gestational embryos, suggesting that an unusual epigenetic regulation might protect the active transgene against de novo methylation occurring generally in mid-gestational embryo.",2.42,973

Epigenetic changes are heritably stable alterations that include DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA-mediated silencing. Aberrant DNA methylation is a common molecular basis for a number of important human diseases, including breast cancer. Changes in DNA methylation profoundly affect global gene expression patterns. What is emerging is a more dynamic and complex association between DNA methylation and gene expression than previously believed. Although many tools have already been developed for analyzing genome-wide gene expression data, tools for analyzing genome-wide DNA methylation have not yet reached the same level of refinement. Here we provide an in-depth analysis of DNA methylation in parallel with gene expression data characteristics and describe the particularities of low-level and high-level analyses of DNA methylation data. Low-level analysis refers to pre-processing of methylation data (i.e. normalization, transformation and filtering), whereas high-level analysis is focused on illustrating the application of the widely used class comparison, class prediction and class discovery methods to DNA methylation data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of DNA methylation on gene expression by measuring the correlation between the degree of CpG methylation and the level of expression and to explore the pattern of methylation as a function of the promoter region.",6.359,1267

Research focused on early-life adversity revealed that early-life experiences have a persistent impact on gene expression and behavior through epigenetic mechanisms. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is sensitive to changes in the early-life environment that associate with DNA methylation of a neuron-specific exon 17 promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Nr3c1). Since initial findings were published in 2004, numerous reports have investigated GR gene methylation in relationship to early-life experience, parental stress, and psychopathology. We conducted a systematic review of this growing literature, which identified 40 articles (13 animal and 27 human studies) published since 2004. The majority of these examined the GR exon variant 1F in humans or the GR17 in rats, and 89% of human studies and 70% of animal studies of early-life adversity reported increased methylation at this exon variant. All the studies investigating exon 1F/17 methylation in conditions of parental stress (one animal study and seven human studies) also reported increased methylation. Studies examining psychosocial stress and psychopathology had less consistent results, with 67% of animal studies reporting increased exon 17 methylation and 17% of human studies reporting increased exon 1F methylation. We found great consistency among studies investigating early-life adversity and the effect of parental stress, even if the precise phenotype and measures of social environment adversity varied among studies. These results are encouraging and warrant further investigation to better understand correlates and characteristics of these associations.",10.255,1315

Environmental factors including stress can trigger epigenetic changes, which have not been well-studied in IBS. We performed a pilot study investigating genome-wide DNA methylation of IBS patients and healthy controls (HCs) to identify potential epigenetic markers and associated pathways. Additionally, we investigated relationships of epigenetic changes in selected genes with clinical traits. METHODS: Twenty-seven IBS patients (59% women; 10 IBS-diarrhea, 8 IBS-constipation, 9 IBS-mixed) and 23 age- and sex-matched HCs were examined. DNA methylation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured using HM450 BeadChip, and representative methylation differences were confirmed by bisulphite sequencing. Gene expression was measured using quantitative PCR. Gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI symptoms were measured using validated questionnaires. Associations were tested using non-parametric methods. KEY RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of IBS patients compared with HCs identified 133 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (mean difference >/=10%; p < 0.05). These genes were associated with gene ontology terms including glutathione metabolism related to oxidative stress and neuropeptide hormone activity. Validation by sequencing confirmed differential methylation of subcommissural organ (SCO)-Spondin (SSPO), glutathione-S-transferases mu 5 (GSTM5), and tubulin polymerization promoting protein genes. Methylation of two promoter CpGs in GSTM5 was associated with epigenetic silencing. Epigenetic changes in SSPO gene were positively correlated with hospital anxiety and depression scores in IBS patients (r > 0.4 and false discovery rate <0.05). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study is the first to comprehensively explore the methylome of IBS patients. We identified DMPs in novel candidate genes which could provide new insights into disease mechanisms; however, these preliminary findings warrant confirmation in larger, independent studies.",3.587,994

Simple collection and removal of the solvent gave products in very good yields that were suitable for further use without additional work-up or purification. Overall, this continuous flow method represents a synthetically useful protocol that is superior to batch processes in terms of shorter reaction times, increased safety, avoidance of work-up procedures, and reduced waste.

Altered DNA methylation occurs in metabolic diseases including obesity, as well as in skeletal, muscle eight months after RYGB. The objective of this study was to test whether promoter methylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1 A), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme-4 (PDK4), transcription factor A (TFAM), interleukin-1 beta (IL1 B), interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is altered in blood after a very low calorie diet (VLCD) or RYGB. METHODS: Obese nondiabetic patients (n = 18, body mass index [BMI] 42.3 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2)) underwent a 14-day VLCD followed by RYGB. Nonobese patients (n = 6, BMI 25.7 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)) undergoing elective cholecystectomy served as controls. DNA methylation of selected promoter regions was measured in whole blood before and after VLCD. A subgroup of seven patients was studied 1-2 days and 12 +/- 3 months after RYGB. Promoter methylation was measured using methylated DNA capture and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: VLCD decreased promoter methylation of PPARGC1 A. Methylation of PPARGC1 A, TFAM, IL1 B, IL6, and TNF promoters was changed two days after RYGB. Similar changes were also seen on day one after cholecystectomy. Moreover, methylation increased in PDK4, IL1 B, IL6, and TNF promoters 12 months after RYGB. CONCLUSION: RYGB induced more profound epigenetic changes than VLCD in promoters of the tested genes in whole blood.

We sought to determine whether tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) typing along with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and MLH1 methylation analysis can help identify women with LS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ECs from GOG210 patients were assessed for MSI, MLH1 methylation, and mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression. Each tumor was classified as having normal MMR, defective MMR associated with MLH1 methylation, or probable MMR mutation (ie, defective MMR but no methylation). Cancer family history and demographic and clinical features were compared for the three groups. Lynch mutation testing was performed for a subset of women. RESULTS: Analysis of 1,002 ECs suggested possible MMR mutation in 11.8% of tumors. The number of patients with a family history suggestive of LS was highest among women whose tumors were classified as probable MMR mutation (P = .001). Lynch mutations were identified in 41% of patient cases classified as probable mutation (21 of 51 tested). One of the MSH6 Lynch mutations was identified in a patient whose tumor had intact MSH6 expression. Age at diagnosis was younger for mutation carriers than noncarriers (54.3 v 62.3 years; P < .01), with five carriers diagnosed at age > 60 years. CONCLUSION: Combined MSI, methylation, and IHC analysis may prove useful in Lynch screening in EC. Twenty-four percent of mutation carriers presented with ECs at age > 60 years, and one carrier had an MSI-positive tumor with no IHC defect. Restricting Lynch testing to women diagnosed at age < 60 years or to women with IHC defects could result in missing a substantial fraction of genetic disease.",1.212,580

It is well established that MGMT methylation should be screened as a predictive marker for TMZ in glioblastoma, and we thus aimed to determine a reliable and practical diagnostic method of MGMT methylation detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 55 glioblastomas were investigated for MGMT methylation status using methylation-specific multiplexed ligation probe amplification (MS-MLPA), illumina human methylation 450K BeadChip array (HM450 K) analysis, and compared to MGMT protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The methylation status of promoter, intron and all MGMT CpG targeted sites were separately correlated to patient's survival. RESULTS: In addition to MS-MLPA and 450 K concordance, our results showed significantly higher overall survival (OS) of patients receiving TMZ and presenting MGMT methylated promoter (mean OS = 21.5 months, p = 0.046). Including all glioblastoma cases and regardless of chemotherapy, MS-MLPA showed significant survival difference between MGMT methylated and unmethylated cases (mean OS = 13, p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: We concluded that in glioblastoma, MGMT promoter methylation predicts TMZ sensitivity. This current comparative analysis leads to consider that MS-MLPA is a valuable as HM450 K array for MGMT methylation status screening.",1.522,878

Establishment of DNA methylation is mediated by the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, whereas DNMT1 ensures maintenance of methylation through replication. Absence of these enzymes is lethal, and somatic mutations in these genes have been associated with several human diseases. How genomic DNA methylation patterns are regulated remains poorly understood, as the mechanisms that guide recruitment and activity of DNMTs in vivo are largely unknown. To gain insights into this matter we determined genomic binding and site-specific activity of the mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. We show that both enzymes localize to methylated, CpG-dense regions in mouse stem cells, yet are excluded from active promoters and enhancers. By specifically measuring sites of de novo methylation, we observe that enzymatic activity reflects binding. De novo methylation increases with CpG density, yet is excluded from nucleosomes. Notably, we observed selective binding of DNMT3B to the bodies of transcribed genes, which leads to their preferential methylation. This targeting to transcribed sequences requires SETD2-mediated methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and a functional PWWP domain of DNMT3B. Together these findings reveal how sequence and chromatin cues guide de novo methyltransferase activity to ensure methylome integrity.",41.456,704

Using (15)N metabolically labeled histones as the internal reference, we quantified global changes in histone post-translational modifications in DeltaTXR1 and DeltaEZL2 cells, to systematically identify potential crosstalk between H3K27 methylation and other PTMs across all four core histones as well as their variants. Most prominently, we observed hyper-acetylation of histones H2A, H2A.Z, and H4 in their N-terminal domains in response to decreased H3K27 methylation.

Mean urinary concentrations of dimethylarsonic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), inorganic arsenic (iAs), and total arsenic (TAs) were 200.50, 46.71, 52.96, and 300.17 mug/L, respectively.

In addition, %iAs and %MMA were positively associated with total arsenic in drinking water (WAs), while %DMA was negatively related with WAs. Regression analysis indicated that the primary methylation index (PMI) and secondary methylation index (SMI) generally decreased with increasing WAs. Females had a higher arsenic methylation capacity compared to males. Younger subjects had lower primary arsenic methylation capacity. However, the secondary arsenic methylation capacity was hardly affected by age. Moreover, both primary and secondary arsenic methylation capacities were negatively related to WAs.",1.748,877

The largely cytoplasmic KMT SMYD3 (SET and MYND domain containing protein 3) is overexpressed in numerous human tumours. However, the molecular mechanism by which SMYD3 regulates cancer pathways and its relationship to tumorigenesis in vivo are largely unknown. Here we show that methylation of MAP3K2 by SMYD3 increases MAP kinase signalling and promotes the formation of Ras-driven carcinomas. Using mouse models for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, we found that abrogating SMYD3 catalytic activity inhibits tumour development in response to oncogenic Ras. We used protein array technology to identify the MAP3K2 kinase as a target of SMYD3. In cancer cell lines, SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 at lysine 260 potentiates activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling module and SMYD3 depletion synergizes with a MEK inhibitor to block Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Finally, the PP2A phosphatase complex, a key negative regulator of the MAP kinase pathway, binds to MAP3K2 and this interaction is blocked by methylation. Together, our results elucidate a new role for lysine methylation in integrating cytoplasmic kinase-signalling cascades and establish a pivotal role for SMYD3 in the regulation of oncogenic Ras signalling.",41.456,1275

In our study, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis was used to analyze the role cytosine methylation plays in wood formation in the commercially important tree species Populus tomentosa. This analysis compared the methylation patterns between xylem tissues (developing xylem and mature xylem) and non-xylem tissues (cambium, shoot apex, young leaf, mature leaf, phloem, root, male catkin, and female catkin) and found 10,316 polymorphic methylation sites. MSAP identified 132 candidate genes with the same methylation patterns in xylem tissues, including seven wood-related genes. The expression of these genes differed significantly between xylem and non-xylem tissue types (P < 0.01). This indicated that the difference of expression of specific genes with unique methylation patterns, rather than relative methylation levels between the two tissue types plays a critical role in wood biosynthesis. However, 46.2% of candidate genes with the same methylation pattern in vascular tissues (cambium, phloem, and developing xylem) did not have distinct expression patterns in xylem and non-xylem tissue. Also, bisulfite sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of MYB, NAC and FASCICLIN-LIKE AGP 13 revealed that the location of cytosine methylation in the gene might affect the expression of different transcripts from the corresponding gene.

After this, it becomes crucial to back up to a developmentally programmed H3K9me2 loss. Massive retrotransposition does not occur following transposon derepression, but the meiotic chromatin landscape is profoundly affected. Indeed, H3K4me3 marks gained over transcriptionally active transposons correlate with formation of SPO11-dependent double-strand breaks and recruitment of the DMC1 repair enzyme in Dnmt3L(-/-) meiotic cells, whereas these features are normally exclusive to meiotic recombination hot spots.

It is unknown how a cellular balance between methylation and demethylation activities is achieved. Here we show that both RdDM and DNA demethylation are highly active at a TE proximal to the major DNA demethylase gene ROS1. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to most other genomic targets, expression of ROS1 is promoted by DNA methylation and antagonized by DNA demethylation. We demonstrate that inducing methylation in the ROS1 proximal region is sufficient to restore ROS1 expression in an RdDM mutant. Additionally, methylation-sensitive expression of ROS1 is conserved in other species, suggesting it is adaptive.

Specific primers were used for amplification and methylation profiles were determined by pyrosequencing. Methylation data from both markers and their relationship with age were determined using linear regression analysis, which indicates a positive correlation between methylation and age. Older individuals tend to have increased methylation in both markers compared to younger individuals and this trend was more pronounced in the GRIA2 locus when compared to NPTX2. The epigenetic predicted age, calculated using a GRIA2 regression analysis model, was strongly correlated to chronological age (R(2) = 0.801), with an average difference of 6.9 years between estimated and observed ages.

Bromodomain-containing protein 2 (Brd2), which belongs to the bromodomain and extraterminal domain family of proteins, suppresses adipocyte differentiation. DNA methylation is critical for several differentiation processes and possibly in adipocyte differentiation. However, whether DNA methylation regulates the expression of Brd2 is not clear. In our study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation contributes to the regulation of Brd2 expression during pre-adipocyte differentiation. Brd2 mRNA levels were low in pre-adipocytes, increased in early adipocytes, and declined in mature adipocytes. To test whether and how Brd2 expression is regulated by DNA methylation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes to adipocytes, cells were cultured in the presence of the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza). Pre-adipocytes and adipocytes exposed to 5-Aza exhibited a dose-dependent increase in Brd2 transcription levels, while only mature adipocytes exhibited increased expression of Brd2 protein. Subsequently, we tested the DNA methylation status of the Brd2 promoter region. Bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that six CpG sites in two predicted promoters of Brd2 were demethylated in early adipocytes and highly methylated in mature adipocytes. Digestion of bisulfite-converted PCR products of the Brd2 promoter region from 3T3-L1 cells with BstU1 (CGGC) revealed that the demethylation rate of the Brd2 promoter was consistent with Brd2 mRNA expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells.

High frequencies of promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) have been frequently reported in NPC and EBVaGC, with several EBV-induced methylated TSGs identified. Further characterization of the epigenomes (genome-wide CpG methylation profile--methylome) of NPC and EBVaGC shows that these EBV-associated tumors display a unique high CpG methylation epigenotype with more extensive gene methylation accumulation, indicating that EBV acts as a direct epigenetic driver for these cancers. Mechanistically, oncogenic modulation of cellular CpG methylation machinery, such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), by EBV-encoded viral proteins accounts for the EBV-induced high CpG methylation epigenotype in NPC and EBVaGC. Thus, uncovering the EBV-associated unique epigenotype of NPC and EBVaGC would provide new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of these unique EBV-associated tumors and further help to develop pharmacologic strategies targeting cellular methylation machinery in these malignancies.",2.155,177

Reciprocally, S516 phosphorylation blocks R513 methylation. NaV1.5 p.G514C, associated to cardiac conduction disease, abrogates R513 methylation, while leaving S516 phosphorylation rate unchanged. This is the first report of methylation-phosphorylation cross-talk of a cardiac ion channel.",3.293,184

To investigate potential epigenetic mechanisms, in this study we evaluated global DNA methylation levels in V79 cells and human HaCaT keratinocytes at several time points during expanded growth of cell cultures following removal of arsenite exposures. We have found altered genomic methylation patterns that persisted up to 40 cell generations in HaCaT cells after the treatments were withdrawn. Moreover, mRNA expression levels were evaluated by RT-PCR for DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HMLH1, and HMSH2 genes, demonstrating that the down regulation of DNMT3A and DNMT3B genes, but not DNMT1, occurred in an arsenic dose-dependent manner, and persisted for many cell generations following removal of the arsenite, offering a plausible mechanism of persistently genotoxic arsenic action. Analyses of promoter methylation status of the DNA mismatch repair genes HMLH1 and HMSH2 show that HMSH2, but not HMLH1, was epigenetically regulated by promoter hypermethylation changes following arsenic treatment. The results reported here demonstrate that arsenic exposure promptly induces genome-wide global DNA hypomethylation, and some specific gene promoter methylation changes, that persist for many cell generations following withdrawal of arsenite, supporting the hypothesis that the cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming at both the gene and genome level that is durable over many cell generations in the absence of further arsenic treatment. These DNA methylation changes, in concert with other known epigenome alterations, are likely contributing to long-lasting arsenic-induced genomic instability that manifests in several ways, including aberrant chromosomal effects.",2.63,111

How mitophagy is regulated in response to cellular physiology remains obscure. Here, we show that mitophagy in yeast is linked to the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway for conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine by the two methyltransferases Cho2 and Opi3. Under mitophagy-inducing conditions, cells lacking Opi3 exhibit retardation of Cho2 repression that causes an anomalous increase in glutathione levels, leading to suppression of Atg32, a mitochondria-anchored protein essential for mitophagy. In addition, loss of Opi3 results in accumulation of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME) and, surprisingly, generation of Atg8-PMME, a mitophagy-incompetent lipid conjugate of the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifier. Amelioration of Atg32 expression and attenuation of Atg8-PMME conjugation markedly rescue mitophagy in opi3-null cells. We propose that proper regulation of phospholipid methylation is crucial for Atg32-mediated mitophagy.",0,390

Endocrinology and metabolism,2015,"The adaptive response of skeletal muscle to exercise training is tightly controlled and therefore requires transcriptional regulation. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism known to modulate gene expression, but its contribution to exercise-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle is not well studied. Here, we describe a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in muscle of trained mice (n = 3). Compared with sedentary controls, 2,762 genes exhibited differentially methylated CpGs (P < 0.05, meth diff >5%, coverage >10) in their putative promoter regions. Alignment with gene expression data (n = 6) revealed 200 genes with a negative correlation between methylation and expression changes in response to exercise training. The majority of these genes were related to muscle growth and differentiation, and a minor fraction involved in metabolic regulation. Among the candidates were genes that regulate the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (Plexin A2) as well as genes that participate in muscle hypertrophy (Igfbp4) and motor neuron innervation (Dok7). Interestingly, a transcription factor binding site enrichment study discovered significantly enriched occurrence of CpG methylation in the binding sites of the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin.

26091484,Impacts of Chromatin States and Long-Range Genomic Segments on Aging and DNA Methylation.,"['Sun D', 'Yi SV']",PloS one,2015,"Understanding the fundamental dynamics of epigenome variation during normal aging is critical for elucidating key epigenetic alterations that affect development, cell differentiation and diseases. Advances in the field of aging and DNA methylation strongly support the aging epigenetic drift model. Although this model aligns with previous studies, the role of other epigenetic marks, such as histone modification, as well as the impact of sampling specific CpGs, must be evaluated. Ultimately, it is crucial to investigate how all CpGs in the human genome change their methylation with aging in their specific genomic and epigenomic contexts. Here, we analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing DNA methylation maps of brain frontal cortex from individuals of diverse ages. Comparisons with blood data reveal tissue-specific patterns of epigenetic drift. By integrating chromatin state information, divergent degrees and directions of aging-associated methylation in different genomic regions are revealed. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing data also open a new door to investigate whether adjacent CpG sites exhibit coordinated DNA methylation changes with aging. We identified significant 'aging-segments', which are clusters of nearby CpGs that respond to aging by similar DNA methylation changes. These segments not only capture previously identified aging-CpGs but also include specific functional categories of genes with implications on epigenetic regulation of aging. For example, genes associated with development are highly enriched in positive aging segments, which are gradually hyper-methylated with aging. On the other hand, regions that are gradually hypo-methylated with aging ('negative aging segments') in the brain harbor genes involved in metabolism and protein ubiquitination. Given the importance of protein ubiquitination in proteome homeostasis of aging brains and neurodegenerative disorders, our finding suggests the significance of epigenetic regulation of this posttranslational modification pathway in the aging brain. Utilizing aging segments rather than individual CpGs will provide more comprehensive genomic and epigenomic contexts to understand the intricate associations between genomic neighborhoods and developmental and aging processes. These results complement the aging epigenetic drift model and provide new insights.",3.234,1657

There is mounting evidence suggesting astrocytic dysfunction in psychopathologies such as major depression, however, little is known about the underlying etiological mechanisms. Here we report a two-stage study investigating genome-wide DNA methylation associated with astrocytic markers in depressive psychopathology. We first characterized prefrontal cortex samples from 121 individuals (76 who died during a depressive episode and 45 healthy controls) for the astrocytic markers GFAP, ALDH1L1, SOX9, GLUL, SCL1A3, GJA1 and GJB6. A subset of 22 cases with consistently downregulated astrocytic markers was then compared with 17 matched controls using methylation binding domain-2 (MBD2) sequencing followed by validation with high-resolution melting and bisulfite Sanger sequencing. With these data, we generated a genome-wide methylation map unique to altered astrocyte-associated depressive psychopathology. The map revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between cases and controls, the majority of which displayed reduced methylation levels in cases. Among intragenic DMRs, those found in GRIK2 (glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 2) and BEGAIN (brain-enriched guanylate kinase-associated protein) were most significant and also showed significant correlations with gene expression. Cell-sorted fractions were investigated and demonstrated an important non-neuronal contribution of methylation status in BEGAIN. Functional cell assays revealed promoter and enhancer-like properties in this region that were markedly decreased by methylation. Furthermore, a large number of our DMRs overlapped known Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE)-identified regulatory elements. Taken together, our data indicate significant differences in the methylation patterns specific to astrocytic dysfunction associated with depressive psychopathology, providing a potential framework for better understanding this disease phenotype.",14.496,922

To date, however, the evidence from plant systems is mixed as to whether patterns of DNA methylation vary significantly among tissues and, if so, whether these differences affect tissue-specific gene expression. To address these questions, we analyzed both bisulfite sequence (BSseq) and transcriptomic sequence data from three biological replicates of two tissues (leaf and floral bud) from the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon. Our first goal was to determine whether tissues were more differentiated in DNA methylation than explained by variation among biological replicates. Tissues were more differentiated than biological replicates, but the analysis of replicated data revealed high (>50%) false positive rates for the inference of differentially methylated sites (DMSs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Comparing methylation to gene expression, we found that differential CG methylation consistently covaried negatively with gene expression, regardless as to whether methylation was within genes, within their promoters or even within their closest transposable element. The relationship between gene expression and either CHG or CHH methylation was less consistent. In total, CG methylation in promoters explained 9% of the variation in tissue-specific expression across genes, suggesting that CG methylation is a minor but appreciable factor in tissue differentiation.",3.234,160

Plasma apolipoprotein-A1 (ApoA1) levels may act as a biomarker of age-associated cognitive performance and decline. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the heritability of plasma ApoA1 protein levels; to examine DNA methylation variation within the APOA1 gene; and to investigate whether APOA1 methylation is associated with plasma ApoA1 levels and episodic memory performance. METHOD: Heritability of ApoA1 protein levels in Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) was assessed using structural equation modelling. APOA1 methylation levels were assayed in two cohorts of cognitively normal older individuals. The methylation status of 12 CpGs in 24 twin pairs from OATS was assayed using the Illumina 450K methylation array. Candidate CpGs were assayed in 454 individuals from Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS) using pyrosequencing. Regression analyses assessed associations between APOA1 methylation levels, ApoA1 plasma levels, and memory performance. RESULTS: No significant heritability was observed for ApoA1 protein levels. APOA1 candidate-gene analyses revealed CpG sites associated with memory performance in the twin study (p < 0.050). Replication of an association between methylation of a specific CpG (cg03010018) in APOA1 and memory performance was observed in Sydney MAS (beta = -0.145, p = 0.010). Methylation of this CpG site was also significantly correlated with ApoA1 protein levels (beta = 0.161, p = 0.019). However, no relationship between a composite memory domain score and methylation was observed (p = 0.389).

This epigenetic change causes transcriptional silencing of the gene. We have previously demonstrated that 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) treatment of FXS lymphoblastoid cell lines reactivates the FMR1 gene, concomitant with CpG sites demethylation, increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3. RESULTS: In order to check the specificity of the 5-azadC-induced DNA demethylation, now we performed bisulphite sequencing of the entire methylation boundary upstream the FMR1 promoter region, which is preserved in control wild-type cells. We did not observe any modification of the methylation boundary after treatment. Furthermore, methylation analysis by MS-MLPA of PWS/AS and BWS/SRS loci demonstrated that 5-azadC treatment has no demethylating effect on these regions. Genome-wide methylation analysis through Infinium 450K (Illumina) showed no significant enrichment of specific GO terms in differentially methylated regions after 5-azadC treatment. We also observed that reactivation of FMR1 transcription lasts up to a month after a 7-day treatment and that maximum levels of transcription are reached at 10-15 days after last administration of 5-azadC. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that the demethylating effect of 5-azadC on genomic DNA is not random, but rather restricted to specific regions, if not exclusively to the FMR1 promoter. Moreover, we showed that 5-azadC has a long-lasting reactivating effect on the mutant FMR1 gene.",5.333,1255

We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in the largest well-differentiated thyroid tumor series reported to date, comprising 83 primary tumors as well as 8 samples of adjacent normal tissue. The epigenetic profiles were closely related to not only tumor histology but also the underlying driver mutation; we found that follicular tumors had higher levels of methylation, which seemed to accumulate in a progressive manner along the tumorigenic process from adenomas to carcinomas. Furthermore, tumors harboring a BRAF or RAS mutation had a larger number of hypo- or hypermethylation events, respectively. The aberrant methylation of several candidate genes potentially related to thyroid carcinogenesis was validated in an independent series of 52 samples. Furthermore, through the integration of methylation and transcriptional expression data, we identified genes whose expression is associated with the methylation status of their promoters. Finally, by integrating clinical follow-up information with methylation levels we propose etoposide-induced 2.4 and Wilms tumor 1 as novel prognostic markers related to recurrence-free survival.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of the expression of genes reported as aberrantly methylated, and the link between gene expression and DNA methylation in BC subtypes. The prognostic value of the expression of 144 aberrantly methylated genes was evaluated in ER+/HER2-, HER2+, and ER-/HER2- molecular BC subtypes, in a meta-analysis of two large transcriptomic cohorts of BC patients (n = 1,938 and n = 1,640). The correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation in distinct gene regions was also investigated in an independent dataset of 104 BCs. Survival and Pearson correlation analyses were computed for each gene separately. The expression of 48 genes was significantly associated with BC prognosis (p < 0.05), and 32 of these prognostic genes exhibited a direct expression-methylation correlation. The expression of several immune-related genes, including CD3D and HLA-A, was associated with both relapse-free survival (HR = 0.42, p = 3.5E-06; HR = 0.35, p = 1.7E-08) and overall survival (HR = 0.50, p = 5.5E-04; HR = 0.68, p = 4.5E-02) in ER-/HER2- BCs. On the overall, the distribution of both positive and negative expression-methylation correlation in distinct gene regions have different effects on gene expression and prognosis in BC subtypes.

DNA methyltranferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine significantly reduced incision-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal sensitivity. Aza-2'-deoxycytidine also reduced hindpaw swelling after incision, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. Global DNA methylation and DNMT3b expression were increased in skin after incision, but none of DNMT1, DNMT3a or DNMT3b was altered in spinal cord or DRG. The expression of proopiomelanocortin Pomc encoding beta-endorphin and Oprm1 encoding the mu-opioid receptor were upregulated peripherally after incision; moreover, Oprm1 expression was further increased under DNMT inhibitor treatment. Finally, local peripheral injection of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone significantly exacerbated incision-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.

Herein, BPA concentrations, BPA-specific metabolizing enzyme gene expression, and global DNA methylation were characterized across three matched tissues from elective pregnancy terminations of 2nd trimester human fetuses: the placenta, liver, and kidney (N=12 each; N=36 total). Compared to liver (free: 0.54-50.5 ng g(-1)), BPA concentrations were lower in matched placenta (<0.05-25.4 ng g(-1)) and kidney (0.08-11.1 ng g(-1)) specimens. BPA-specific metabolism gene expression of GUSB, UGT2B15, STS, and SULT1A1 differed across each tissue type; however, conjugation and deconjugation expression patterns were similar across the fetus. Average LINE1 and CCGG global methylation were 58.3% and 59.2% in placenta, 79.5% and 66.4% in fetal liver, and 77.9% and 77.0% in fetal kidney, with significant tissue-specific DNA methylation differences in both LINE1 (p-value<0.001) and CCGG content (p-value<0.001).

METHOD: This study included 29 human brain samples from older schizophrenic patients with severe and mild cognitive impairment. We administered a comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests to determine the size of the impairment across different cognitive domains. We focused our study on the analysis of the methylation pattern of 19 genes of major neurotransmitter systems using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. RESULTS: Our results highlight an absence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation in older patients with schizophrenia and in healthy controls, irrespective of the degree of the cognitive deficit measured in the neuropsychological assessment (Fisher's exact test; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: mRNA or protein expression level differences in genes of major neurotransmitter systems that are known to be altered in schizophrenia must be because of regulatory mechanisms other than the DNA methylation of its promoter regions, although our results highlight the idea that the analysis of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in schizophrenia represents a new approach that has the possibility of uncovering molecular mechanisms of dysregulated gene expression in this complex disorder.",2.866,959

In cells, DNA methylation is preferentially occuring in the linker region of nucleosomes, suggesting a structural impact of chromatin on DNA methylation. These observations raise the question whether DNA methyltransferases are capable to recognize the nucleosomal substrates and to modify the packaged DNA. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of nucleosome binding and nucleosomal DNA methylation by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Our binding studies show that Dnmt1 has a DNA length sensing activity, binding cooperatively to DNA, and requiring a minimal DNA length of 20 bp. Dnmt1 needs linker DNA to bind to nucleosomes and most efficiently recognizes nucleosomes with symmetric DNA linkers. Footprinting experiments reveal that Dnmt1 binds to both DNA linkers exiting the nucleosome core. The binding pattern correlates with the efficient methylation of DNA linkers. However, the enzyme lacks the ability to methylate nucleosomal CpG sites on mononucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays, unless chromatin remodeling enzymes create a dynamic chromatin state. In addition, our results show that Dnmt1 functionally interacts with specific chromatin remodeling enzymes to enable complete methylation of hemi-methylated DNA in chromatin.",3.234,1586

However, low accuracy and the lack of standardized protocols make the development of alternative methods for the estimation of individual's age even more urgent for several research fields, such as biological anthropology, biodemography, forensics, evolutionary genetics, and ancient DNA studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify genomic regions whose DNA methylation level correlates with age in modern teeth. METHODS: We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to analyze DNA methylation levels of specific CpGs located in the ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes. We considered methylation data from cementum, dentin and pulp of 21 modern teeth (from 17 to 77 years old) to construct a mathematical model able to exploit DNA methylation values to predict age of the individuals. RESULTS: The median difference between the real age and that estimated using DNA methylation values is 1.20 years (SD = 1.9) if DNA is recovered from both cementum and pulp of the same modern teeth, 2.25 years (SD = 2.5) if DNA is recovered from dental pulp, 2.45 years (SD = 3.3) if DNA is extracted from cementum and 7.07 years (SD = 7.0) when DNA is recovered from dentin only. DISCUSSION: We propose for the first time the evaluation of DNA methylation at ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes as a powerful tool to predict age in modern teeth for anthropological applications. Future studies are needed to apply this method also to historical and relatively ancient human teeth.",2.379,1351

METHODS: KISS1 promoter methylation, mRNA expression and protein expression were detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively, in 126 CRC tissues and 142 normal colorectal tissues. Human CRC cells with KISS1 promoter hypermethylation and poor KISS1 expression were treated in vitro with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR). After treatment, KISS1 promoter methylation, KISS1 mRNA and protein expression and cell migration and invasion were evaluated. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of KISS1 occurred frequently in CRC samples (83.1%, 105/126), but was infrequent in normal colorectal tissues (6.34%, 9/142). Moreover, KISS1 methylation was associated with tumor differentiation, the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). KISS1 methylation was also associated with low KISS1 expression (P < 0.001). Furthermore, we observed re-expression of the KISS1 gene and decreased cell migration after 5-Aza-CdR treatment in a CRC cell line. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that KISS1 is down-regulated in cancer tissues via promoter hypermethylation and therefore may represent a candidate target for treating metastatic CRC.",2.369,1575

We analyzed the DNA methylation profiles for each NKG2DL by pyrosequencing in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), hepatocellular carcinoma (HC), breast cancer and colon cancer cell lines. High levels of DNA methylation for NKG2DL were found in some tumor cell lines, mainly in AML cells. This hypermethylation was correlated with the absence of transcription for NKG2DL. Higher DNA methylation levels for MICA, ULBP1 and ULBP2 were observed in AML patients (n=60) compared with healthy donors (n=25). However, no DNA methylation for NKG2DL was found in colon cancer patients (n=44). Treatment with demethylating agents (5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) restored the expression of NKG2DL on the cell surface of AML cells, leading to an enhanced recognition by NKG2D-expressing cells. Our data suggest that NKG2DL may be aberrantly silenced by DNA methylation as a consequence of tumor development in AML patients.",2.913,1662
27236571,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are associated with insulin receptor substrate 2 methylation in adipose tissues of Korean women.,"['Kim YH', 'Lee YS', 'Lee DH', 'Kim DS']",Environmental research,2016,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly lipid soluble and are an increasing concern for general populations given their various adverse health effects, including obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. DNA methylation can act as a downstream effector for the biological effects of environmental exposures, but whether PAHs influence DNA methylation is unclear. To test for possible adverse effects of PAHs on adipose tissue (AT), we determined the promoter methylation status of 12 genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (CS, GLUT4, IR, IRS1, IRS2, LIPIN1, MCAD, PCK1, PCK2, PPARGC1Beta, SDHA, and SREBP1) in visceral AT of Korean women by using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). IRS2 methylation alone was significantly associated with concentrations of individual PAH chemicals. When the PAH summary measure was used, the odds ratios of IRS2 hypermethylation across quartile of the PAH summary measure were 1, 1.7, 2.0, and 11.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.5-84.0) after adjusting for age and BMI (P trend=0.02). The strength of association between PAH summary measure and IRS2 hypermethylation was as similar as that of BMI. Collectively, these results suggested that lipophilic PAHs might be contributing factors to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance through methylation-mediated suppression of the IRS2 gene. However, further studies with large sample size are needed to confirm our findings.",4.373,686

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the MassARRAY EpiTYPER assay and immunohistochemistry, we examined methylation levels and the protein expression status of hMLH1 in 33 SSL/Ds with conventional epithelial dysplasia and compared the results with those of control hyperplastic polyps (HPs) and SSLs. The methylation level of hMLH1 was higher in the dysplastic component than in the non-dysplastic component of SSL/Ds (P = 0.005), and differed significantly with regard to the degree of dysplasia (P = 0.002). The methylation levels of hMLH1 in the dysplastic component of SSL/Ds tended to be higher than those of control SSLs and HPs (P = 0.063 and P = 0.017, respectively). The loss of hMLH1 protein expression was identified in only 13 of 33 (39.39%) dysplastic components of SSL/Ds. CONCLUSION: Promoter methylation and loss of protein expression of hMLH1 are not parallel processes that occur concurrently. hMLH1 methylation is an early molecular event which occurs even in HP. However, the loss of hMLH1 expression is a much later step, found in approximately 40% of SSL/Ds at various histological stages. Notably, the loss of hMLH1 protein expression does not necessarily precede the development of cytological dysplasia in SSL.",3.453,1889

DNA methylation has been posited as a mechanism linking psychological factors to CHD risk. In a cohort of community-dwelling elderly men, we explored the associations between positive and negative psychological factors with DNA methylation in promoter regions of multiple genes involved in immune/inflammatory processes related to atherosclerosis. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Greater Boston, Massachusetts area. PARTICIPANTS: Samples of 538 to 669 men participating in the Normative Aging Study cohort with psychological measures and DNA methylation measures, collected on 1-4 visits between 1999 and 2006 (mean age=72.7 years at first visit). OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined anxiety, depression, hostility and life satisfaction as predictors of leucocyte gene-specific DNA methylation. We estimated repeated measures linear mixed models, controlling for age, smoking, education, history of heart disease, stroke or diabetes, % lymphocytes, % monocytes and plasma folate. RESULTS: Psychological distress measured by anxiety, depression and hostility was positively associated, and happiness and life satisfaction were inversely associated with average Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and coagulation factor III (F3) promoter methylation levels. There was some evidence that hostility was positively associated with toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) promoter methylation, and that life satisfaction was inversely associated with TLR-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) promoter methylation. We observed less consistent and significant associations between psychological factors and average methylation for promoters of the genes for glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that positive and negative psychological factors affect DNA methylation of selected genes involved in chronic immune/inflammatory processes and inflammation-related endothelial dysfunction. Such epigenetic changes may represent biological pathways that mediate the effects of psychological factors on CHD.",2.271,1265

Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, epigenetic determinants, such as DNA methylation, are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of GD. Here, we for the first time reported the DNA methylation pattern in GD through a high-throughput analysis. In order to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation profile of GD, methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and Nimblegen human DNA methylation 3 x 720 K promoter plus CpG island microarrays were used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from blood samples in GD patients. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) was used to validate the methylation state of candidate genes. Transcription level of each gene was estimated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 132 hypermethylated and 133 hypomethylated regions were identified in GD. The methylation of ICAM1 in GD patients and normal controls was significantly different (p<0.05). In the female group, significantly decreased methylation was observed in GD patients compared with normal controls (p<0.05). The transcription of ICAM1 at the mRNA level was significantly higher in GD patients compared with normal controls (p<0.05). Besides, the transcription of DNMT1 and MECP2 at the mRNA level was significantly decreased in GD patients compared with normal controls (p<0.05).

RESULTS: A total of 3000 and 386 CpGs were differentially methylated after successful H.pylori eradication in gastric mucosa and blood leukocyte DNA respectively, and 17 were the same alteration trend in the both tissues. The differentially methylated CpGs were located more frequently in promoters or CpG islands for gastric mucosa and gene body or open sea for blood leukocyte DNA. In eradicated gastric mucosa, the hypermethylated CpGs were enriched across inflammatory pathways, while the hypomethylated CpGs in tube morphogenesis, development and so on. The final validation found lower SPI1, PRIC285 and S1PR4 methylation levels in H.pylori positive subjects by case-control comparison, and increased methylation levels in H.pylori eradicated gastric mucosa by self-comparison. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis suggested that the up-regulation of the three genes by hypomethylation might be associated with gastric carcinogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip was used to compare methylation profiles prior to and after eradication treatment. The methylation levels of identified candidate differentially methylated genes before and after H.pylori eradication were further validated by two stages (Stage I: self-comparison of 16 subjects before and after anti-H.pylori treatment; Stage II: case-control comparison of 25 H.pylori positive and 25 negative subjects and self-comparison of 50 anti-H.pylori treated subjects).

Using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), the methylation status of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) genes was examined in cell-free circulating DNA from 155 plasma samples obtained from patients with early and advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). APC and RASSF1A hypermethylation was frequently observed in both early and advanced disease, and was significantly associated with a poorer disease outcome. The methylation status of the APC and RASSF1A promoters was investigated in cell-free DNA of patients with CRC. Using MSP, the promoter methylation status of APC and RASSF1A was examined in 155 blood samples obtained from patients with CRC, 88 of whom had operable CRC (oCRC) and 67 had metastatic CRC (mCRC). The frequency of APC methylation in patients with oCRC was 33%. Methylated APC promoter was significantly associated with older age (P=0.012), higher stage (P=0.014) and methylated RASSF1A status (P=0.050). The frequency of APC methylation in patients with mCRC was 53.7%. In these patients, APC methylation was significantly associated with methylated RASSF1A status (P=0.016). The frequency of RASSF1A methylation in patients with oCRC was 25%. Methylated RASSF1A in oCRC was significantly associated with higher stage (P=0.021). The frequency of RASSF1A methylation in mCRC was 44.8%. Methylated RASSF1A in mCRC was associated with moderate differentiation (P=0.012), high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (P=0.023) and methylated APC status (P=0.016). Patients with an unmethylated APC gene had better survival in both early (81+/-5 vs. 27+/-4 months, P<0.001) and advanced disease (37+/-7 vs. 15+/-3 months, P<0.001), compared with patients with methylated APC. Patients with an unmethylated RASSF1A gene had better survival in both early (71+/-6 vs. 46+/-8 months, P<0.001) and advanced disease (28+/-4 vs. 16+/-3 months, P<0.001) than patients with methylated RASSF1A. The observed significant correlations between APC and RASSF1A promoter methylation status and survival may be indicative of a prognostic role for these genes in CRC, which requires additional testing in larger studies.",1.554,530

The aim of this study was to determine the risk sizes and variation trends of SFRP2 methylation in CRC development in Chinese populations. Subgroup meta-analysis and the least-squares curve-fitting method were carried out to analyze the risk of SFRP2 methylation in tissue, feces, and blood detection from 2221 samples, including a total of 1103 cases of CRC, 459 cases of adenoma, 257 cases of polyps, and 402 controls. The data showed that odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) between CRC and controls for tissue, feces, and blood detection were 334.01 (104.42-1068.39), 63.76 (20.62-197.63), and 133.75 (18.32-976.32), respectively. There were also significant differences between tissue and feces or blood as well as between feces and blood methylation frequency. These results showed that the risk size in tissue was much greater than that in feces and that in blood. The results pointed out that three curves in tissue, feces, and blood detection described the variation trends of methylation incidence from the control to polyp, to adenoma and to CRC, and that the variation trend of the risk size of SFRP2 methylation was synchronized with the histological evolution process of CRC. The variation trend of the risk size of SFRP2 methylation incidence is consistent with the histological evolution process of CRC. The susceptibility to SFRP2 methylation is an important biomarker in the study of early diagnosis of CRC and high-risk patients.",2.649,903

However, the epigenetic mechanisms of obesity are incompletely understood. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of skeletal muscle DNA methylation in combination with transcriptomic changes in obesity. RESULTS: Muscle biopsies were obtained basally from lean (n = 12; BMI = 23.4 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) and obese (n = 10; BMI = 32.9 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) participants in combination with euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps to assess insulin sensitivity. We performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) next-generation methylation and microarray analyses on DNA and RNA isolated from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. There were 13,130 differentially methylated cytosines (DMC; uncorrected P < 0.05) that were altered in the promoter and untranslated (5' and 3'UTR) regions in the obese versus lean analysis. Microarray analysis revealed 99 probes that were significantly (corrected P < 0.05) altered. Of these, 12 genes (encompassing 22 methylation sites) demonstrated a negative relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation. Specifically, sorbin and SH3 domain containing 3 (SORBS3) which codes for the adapter protein vinexin was significantly decreased in gene expression (fold change -1.9) and had nine DMCs that were significantly increased in methylation in obesity (methylation differences ranged from 5.0 to 24.4 %). Moreover, differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis identified a region in the 5'UTR (Chr.8:22,423,530-22,423,569) of SORBS3 that was increased in methylation by 11.2 % in the obese group. The negative relationship observed between DNA methylation and gene expression for SORBS3 was validated by a site-specific sequencing approach, pyrosequencing, and qRT-PCR. Additionally, we performed transcription factor binding analysis and identified a number of transcription factors whose binding to the differentially methylated sites or region may contribute to obesity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that obesity alters the epigenome through DNA methylation and highlights novel transcriptomic changes in SORBS3 in skeletal muscle.",4.543,1297
26675734,Competition between DNA methylation and transcription factors determines binding of NRF1.,"['Domcke S', 'Bardet AF', 'Adrian Ginno P', 'Hartl D', 'Burger L', 'Schubeler D']",Nature,2015,"Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene activity, yet they bind only a fraction of their corresponding DNA sequence motifs in any given cell type. Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.",41.456,188

In many species, constitutive heterochromatin is decorated with histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and cytosine methylation. In Neurospora crassa, a five-protein complex, DCDC, catalyzes H3K9 methylation, which then directs DNA methylation. Here, we identify and characterize a gene important for DCDC function, dim-3 (defective in methylation-3), which encodes the nuclear import chaperone NUP-6 (Importin alpha). The critical mutation in dim-3 results in a substitution in an ARM repeat of NUP-6 and causes a substantial loss of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. Surprisingly, nuclear transport of all known proteins involved in histone and DNA methylation, as well as a canonical transport substrate, appear normal in dim-3 strains. Interactions between DCDC members also appear normal, but the nup-6(dim-3) allele causes the DCDC members DIM-5 and DIM-7 to mislocalize from heterochromatin and NUP-6dim-3 itself is mislocalized from the nuclear envelope, at least in conidia. GCN-5, a member of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex, also shows altered localization in dim-3, raising the possibility that NUP-6 is necessary to localize multiple chromatin complexes following nucleocytoplasmic transport.",7.528,1316

METHODS: Seventy-five neonates and their mothers were recruited from Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Subjects were divided into three groups by birth weight: low (< 3,500 g, n = 20), medium (3,500-3,999 g, n = 30) and high (>/= 4,000 g, n = 25). Placental FTO transcript levels and promoter methylation were determined by quantitative PCR and Sequenom MassARRAY(R). RESULTS: Placental FTO mRNA expression was significantly increased in the high- and medium-weight groups compared to the low-weight group (p = 0.023). Methylation rates of CpG11 sites were significantly decreased in high-birth weight newborns (p = 0.018). Multiple linear regressions showed placental FTO mRNA, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and CpG11 methylation rate were independently associated with increased fetal birth weight. Additionally, FTO mRNA expression was negatively associated with CpG6.7.8.9 methylation in mothers that underwent C-section. CONCLUSIONS: High placental FTO expression is associated with increased birth weight in Chinese neonates, and FTO promoter methylation level at a specific CpG site is negatively associated with birth weight.

Epidemiologic studies have focused recently on determining associations between lead exposure and global DNA methylation; however, such approaches preclude the identification of loci that may alter human disease risk. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal, postnatal, and early childhood lead exposure can alter the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that control the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes involved in metabolism, growth, and development. METHODS: Questionnaire data and serial blood lead levels were obtained from 105 participants (64 females, 41 males) of the Cincinnati Lead Study from birth to 78 months. When participants were adults, we used Sequenom EpiTYPER assays to test peripheral blood DNA to quantify CpG methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes at DMRs of 22 human imprinted genes. Statistical analyses were conducted using linear regression. RESULTS: Mean blood lead concentration from birth to 78 months was associated with a significant decrease in PEG3 DMR methylation (beta = -0.0014; 95% CI: -0.0023, -0.0005, p = 0.002), stronger in males (beta = -0.0024; 95% CI: -0.0038, -0.0009, p = 0.003) than in females (beta = -0.0009; 95% CI: -0.0020, 0.0003, p = 0.1).

The magnitude of associations between cumulative lead exposure and CpG methylation remained unaltered from 30 to 78 months.

Overall, the methylation pattern correlated with the major biological (ZAP-70 and CD38), and molecular (IGHV mutation) markers, distinguishing CLL cases according to IGHV mutational status. Cell adhesion molecules were enriched in the signature of unmutated (UM) versus mutated (M-) CLL. Moreover, in M-CLL CpG hyper-methylation in three genes, including SPG20, was significantly anti-correlated with the corresponding gene expression level. Finally, the correlation between the methylation pattern and clinical parameters was investigated. Notably, out of 42 methyl-probes that were significantly associated with progression free survival (PFS), hyper-methylation of SPG20 was also positively associated with PFS.

The methylation states of the VEGF promoter region were also assessed to reveal the underlying mechanism. Finally, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) was administrated to reveal the relationship of DNA methylation on the regulation of the VEGF level. Results showed that sevoflurane attenuated the hypoxia-induced VEGF level without altering the HIF-1alpha after exposure for 24 and 72 h. Sevoflurane increased the DNA methylation of the VEGF promoter region. The attenuation effect of sevoflurane on hypoxia-induced VEGF level could be blocked by 5-Aza.

DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium 450K arrays in 40 tumors and 17 normal breast samples, together with DNA copy number changes and subtype-specific markers by tissue microarrays. The identified methylation signatures were validated against a cohort of 212 tumors annotated for breast cancer subtypes by the PAM50 method (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Selected markers were pyrosequenced in an independent validation cohort of 310 tumors and analyzed with respect to survival, clinical stage and grade. The results demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns linked to the luminal-B subtype are characterized by CpG island promoter methylation events. In contrast, a large fraction of basal-like tumors are characterized by hypomethylation events occurring within the gene body. Based on these hallmark signatures, we defined two DNA methylation-based subtypes, Epi-LumB and Epi-Basal, and show that they are associated with unfavorable clinical parameters and reduced survival. Our data show that distinct mechanisms leading to changes in CpG methylation states are operative in different breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, we show that a few selected proxy markers can be used to detect the distinct DNA methylation-based subtypes thereby providing valuable information on disease prognosis.",5.331,574

First, we investigated the affinity of an anti-methylcytosine antibody for methylcytosine in full match, bulge, mismatch and abasic sites using surface plasmon resonance measurement and a microtiter plate to explore the differences as regards antibody binding to the target methylcytosine. The highest affinity, which was comparable to that in a single strand of DNA, was observed in the bulge region. In particular, no affinity was observed in a full match site. This is because there is no interaction such as hydrogen bond or pi-pi stacking for the bulged methylcytosine, thus enabling only the target in the bulge to be looped out. Methylated and unmethylated genomic DNA were blended to form a model DNA with which to assess the methylation ratio at a specific site. Fragmented DNA was hybridized with a biotinylated probe DNA, which has a sequence capable of forming a single base bulge at the target. The probe design is simple because it consists solely of the elimination of guanine paired with the target cytosine from a full match sequence. As a result, we successfully obtained a linear relationship (r(2)=0.9962) between the immunoassay signal and the methylation ratio of a specific site within 4 h.",6.409,1292

At the molecular level, the acquisition and maintenance of memory requires changes in chromatin modifications. In an effort to unravel the epigenetic network underlying both short- and long-term memory, we examined chromatin modification changes in two distinct mouse brain regions, two cell types and three time points before and after contextual learning. We found that histone modifications predominantly changed during memory acquisition and correlated surprisingly little with changes in gene expression. Although long-lasting changes were almost exclusive to neurons, learning-related histone modification and DNA methylation changes also occurred in non-neuronal cell types, suggesting a functional role for non-neuronal cells in epigenetic learning. Finally, our data provide evidence for a molecular framework of memory acquisition and maintenance, wherein DNA methylation could alter the expression and splicing of genes involved in functional plasticity and synaptic wiring.",16.095,1801

The Ten eleven translocation (Tet) family of enzymes converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which promotes passive DNA demethylation and functions as an intermediate in an active DNA demethylation process. Tet1/Tet2 double-knockout mice are characterized by developmental defects and epigenetic instability, suggesting a requirement for Tet-mediated DNA demethylation for the proper regulation of gene expression during differentiation. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite and transcriptome sequencing to characterize the underlying mechanisms. Our results uncover the hypermethylation of DNA methylation canyons as the genomic key feature of Tet1/Tet2 double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Canyon hypermethylation coincided with disturbed regulation of associated genes, suggesting a mechanistic explanation for the observed Tet-dependent differentiation defects. Based on these results, we propose an important regulatory role of Tet-dependent DNA demethylation for the maintenance of DNA methylation canyons, which prevents invasive DNA methylation and allows functional regulation of canyon-associated genes.",4.777,1356

It is a common (1%) and often familial disease with a discordance rate of ~50% in monozygotic twins. This high discordance is often explained by the role of yet unknown environmental, random, and epigenetic factors. The involvement of DNA methylation in this disease appears logical, but remains to be established. METHODS: We have used blood DNA from two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and their parents in order to assess genome-wide methylation using a NimbleGen Methylation Promoter Microarray. RESULTS: The genome-wide results show that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) exist between members representing discordant monozygotic twins. Some DMRs are shared with parent(s) and others appear to be de novo. We found twenty-seven genes affected by DMR changes that were shared in the affected member of two discordant monozygotic pairs from unrelated families. Interestingly, the genes affected by pair specific DMRs share specific networks. Specifically, this study has identified two networks;",2.873,1512

Epigenetic mechanisms control gene expression and are likely to regulate the IPF transcriptome. OBJECTIVES: To identify methylation marks that modify gene expression in IPF lung. METHODS: We assessed DNA methylation (comprehensive high-throughput arrays for relative methylation arrays [CHARM]) and gene expression (Agilent gene expression arrays) in 94 patients with IPF and 67 control subjects, and performed integrative genomic analyses to define methylation-gene expression relationships in IPF lung. We validated methylation changes by a targeted analysis (Epityper), and performed functional validation of one of the genes identified by our analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 2,130 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; <5% false discovery rate), of which 738 are associated with significant changes in gene expression and enriched for expected inverse relationship between methylation and expression (P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). We validated 13/15 DMRs by targeted analysis of methylation. Methylation-expression quantitative trait loci (methyl-eQTL) identified methylation marks that control cis and trans gene expression, with an enrichment for cis relationships (P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). We found five trans methyl-eQTLs where a methylation change at a single DMR is associated with transcriptional changes in a substantial number of genes; four of these DMRs are near transcription factors (castor zinc finger 1 [CASZ1], FOXC1, MXD4, and ZDHHC4). We studied the in vitro effects of change in CASZ1 expression and validated its role in regulation of target genes in the methyl-eQTL.

Micronucleus formation can result from global hypomethylation of DNA repeat sequences. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between solar UV exposure and methylation pattern in LINE-1 repetitive elements in PBL DNA and to see if serum 25(OH)D levels modify it. METHOD: Personal solar UV exposure was estimated from hours of outdoor exposure over 6 weeks recalled at the time of blood collection in 208 male and female participants living in South Australia. Methylation in LINE-1 repetitive elements was assessed in PBL using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Methylation in LINE-1 decreased with increasing solar UV exposure (% decrease = 0.5% per doubling of sUV; 95%CI: -0.7 to -0.2 p(value) = 0.00003). Although there was no correlation between LINE-1 methylation and micronucleus frequency, there was a 4.3% increase (95%CI: 0.6-8.1 p-value = 0.02) in nucleoplasmic bridges and a 4.3% increase in necrosis (CI: 1.9-6.8 p-value = 0.0005) for every 1% increase in LINE-1 methylation. Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with DNA methylation; or did it modify the association of solar UV with DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to solar UV radiation may reduce DNA methylation in circulating lymphocytes. This association does not appear to be influenced or mediated by vitamin D status.",3.68,1842

RESULTS: All four genes had significantly higher methylation levels in GC patients than in CAG and control subjects. However, only UCHL1 methylation was significantly correlated with the tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. While THBS1 methylation was altered in an age-dependent manner, FLNC methylation was correlated with differentiation and Helicobacter pylori infection. DLEC1 methylation was only associated with tumor size. Moreover, methylated UCHL1 with or without THBS1 in the serum was found to be significantly associated with a poor prognosis.

Approximately 25% to 60% of CIMP tumors are microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) due to DNA hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter. Our aim was to determine if the distributions of clinicopathologic factors in CIMP-positive tumors with MLH1 DNA methylation differed from those in CIMP-positive tumors without DNA methylation of MLH1. METHODS: We assessed the associations between age, sex, tumor-site, MSI status BRAF and KRAS mutations, and family colorectal cancer history with MLH1 methylation status in a large population-based sample of CIMP-positive colorectal cancers defined by a 5-marker panel using unconditional logistic regression to assess the odds of MLH1 methylation by study variables. RESULTS: Subjects with CIMP-positive tumors without MLH1 methylation were significantly younger, more likely to be male, and more likely to have distal colon or rectal primaries and the MSI-L phenotype. CIMP-positive MLH1-unmethylated tumors were significantly less likely than CIMP-positive MLH1-methylated tumors to harbor a BRAF V600E mutation and significantly more likely to harbor a KRAS mutation. MLH1 methylation was associated with significantly better overall survival (HR, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MLH1 methylation in CIMP-positive tumors is not a completely random event and implies that there are environmental or genetic determinants that modify the probability that MLH1 will become methylated during CIMP pathogenesis.

The clinical symptoms of CCA were revealed as the disease progresses to advanced stage. Thus, specific diagnostic biomarkers are important for this fatal disease. We applied methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) to quantify DNA methylation levels of opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like gene (OPCML) and Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) in 73 primary CCA and 10 adjacent normal tissues and evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the assay. The median methylation level of OPCML in CCA was 38.7 % (ranged from 0 to 82.2 %) and of SFRP1 was 31.5 % (ranged from 0 to 86.2 %). Methylation cutoff values of OPCML and SFRP1 derived from adjacent normal tissue were 6.90 and 10.44 %, respectively. With these cutoff values, the area under curve (AUC) of OPCML was 0.932 (95 % CI 0.878-0.986) and of SFRP1 was 0.951 (95 % CI 0.905-0.996).

Previous studies investigating the IGF2/H19 locus have mainly focused on a single molecular level such as genomic alterations or altered DNA methylation levels and the causal changes underlying IGF2 overexpression are still not fully established. In the current study, we analyzed 62 tumors of the adrenal gland from patients with Conn's adenoma (CA, n=12), pheochromocytomas (PCC, n=10), adrenocortical benign tumors (ACBT, n=20), and adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC, n=20). Gene expression, somatic copy number variation of chr11p15.5, and DNA methylation status of three differential methylated regions of the IGF2/H19 locus including the H19 imprinting control region were integratively analyzed. IGF2 overexpression was found in 85% of the ACCs and 100% of the PCCs compared to 23% observed in CAs and ACBTs. Copy number aberrations of chr11p15.5 were abundant in both PCCs and ACCs but while PCCs retained a diploid state, ACCs were frequently tetraploid (7/19). Loss of either a single allele or loss of two alleles of the same parental origin in tetraploid samples resulted in a uniparental disomy-like genotype. These copy number changes correlated with hypermethylation of the H19 ICR suggesting that the lost alleles were the unmethylated maternal alleles. Our data provide conclusive evidence that loss of the maternal allele correlates with IGF2 overexpression in adrenal tumors and that hypermethylation of the H19 ICR is a consequence thereof.",4.805,1469

Residents of the Andean regions of Colombia are at high risk for gastric cancer. METHODS: A cohort of 976 Colombian subjects was followed over 16 years examining effects of Helicobacter pylori eradication and treatment with antioxidants on progression of lesions. We performed methylation analysis of DNA from baseline antral biopsies from 104 subjects for whom follow-up data were available for at least 12 years. Methylation was quantitated for AMPH, CDKN2A, CDH1, EN1, EMX1, NKX6-1, PCDH10, RPRM, RSPO2, SORCS3, ZIC1, and ZNF610 genes, using Pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Levels of DNA methylation were associated with baseline diagnosis for AMPH, EMX1, RPRM, RSPO2, SORCS3, and ZNF610. After adjusting for baseline diagnosis and H. pylori infection, methylation levels of AMPH, PCDH10, RSPO2, and ZNF610 had progression coefficients that increased and P values that decreased over 6, 12, and 16 years. Methylation for SORCS3 was associated with progression at all 3 time points but without the continual strengthening of the effect. Scores for mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or intraepithelial lymphocytes were unrelated to progression. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation levels of AMPH, PCDH10, RSPO2, SORCS3, and ZNF610 predict progression of gastric lesions independent of the effect of duration of H. pylori infection, baseline diagnosis, gender of the patient, or scores for mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or intraepithelial lymphocytes.

However, the regulation of PP2A methylation remains poorly understood. We have reported that altered leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT1)-dependent PP2A methylation is associated with down-regulation of PP2A holoenzymes containing the Balpha subunit (PP2A/Balpha) and subsequent accumulation of phosphorylated Tau in N2a cells, in vivo and in AD. Here, we show that pools of LCMT1, methylated PP2A, and PP2A/Balpha are co-enriched in cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains/rafts purified from N2a cells. In contrast, demethylated PP2A is preferentially distributed in non-rafts wherein small amounts of the PP2A methylesterase PME-1 are exclusively present. A methylation-incompetent PP2A mutant is excluded from rafts. Enhanced methylation of PP2A promotes the association of PP2A and Tau with the plasma membrane. Altered PP2A methylation following expression of a catalytically inactive LCMT1 mutant, knockdown of LCMT1, or alterations in one-carbon metabolism all result in a loss of plasma membrane-associated PP2A and Tau in N2a cells. This correlates with accumulation of soluble phosphorylated Tau, a hallmark of AD and other tauopathies. Thus, our findings reveal a distinct compartmentalization of PP2A and PP2A regulatory enzymes in plasma membrane microdomains and identify a novel methylation-dependent mechanism involved in modulating the targeting of PP2A, and its substrate Tau, to the plasma membrane. We propose that alterations in the membrane localization of PP2A and Tau following down-regulation of LCMT1 may lead to PP2A and Tau dysfunction in AD.",0,1700

In this study, we investigated the clinical and biological factors associated with long-term survival in glioblastoma patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. METHOD: Demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients with glioblastoma diagnosed between May 2004 and September 2007, treated with chemoradiotherapy and with associated tissue samples available for biomarker analysis. MGMT methylation was determined by pyrosequencing. IDH1 mutation was identified by R132H immunohistochemistry. Univariate Cox regression analysis of factors associated with survival and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using the SPSS statistics package. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included in the study. Median follow-up was 12.2 months (range 1.6-102.4). Median OS was 12.1 months (95 % CI: 10.8-13.3) and median PFS was 8.2 months (95 % CI: 6.8-9.5). The 2-, 3- and 5-year survival was 18, 9 and 6 % respectively. Three patients are still alive at 7.4, 8.3 and 8.5 years after diagnosis. Cox proportional-hazards regression identified independent prognostic factors for OS, female (p = 0.019), MGMT methylation (p < 0.0001) and IDH1 mutation (p = 0.023), and for PFS, MGMT methylation (p = 0.001) and IDH1 mutation (p = 0.018).

Methylation of VEGFR-2 was independent of ligand binding and was not regulated by ligand stimulation. Methylation of Lys(1041) enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity in response to ligands. Additionally, interfering with the methylation of VEGFR-2 by pharmacological inhibition or by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that methylation of Lys(1041) was required for VEGFR-2-mediated angiogenesis in zebrafish and tumor growth in mice. We propose that methylation of Lys(1041) promotes the activation of VEGFR-2 and that similar posttranslational modification could also regulate the activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases.",6.279,1871

Typically, methylation levels are measured at individual cytosine/guanine (CpG) sites or over a short region of interest. However, regions of interest often show heterogeneous methylation comprising multiple patterns of methylation (epialleles) on individual DNA strands. Heterogeneous methylation is largely ignored because digital methods are required to deconvolute these usually complex patterns of epialleles. Currently, only single-molecule approaches, such as next generation sequencing (NGS), can provide detailed epiallele information. Because NGS is not yet feasible for routine practice, we developed a single-molecule-like approach, named for epiallele quantification (EpiQ). METHODS: EpiQ uses DNA ligases and the enhanced thermal instability of short (</=19 bases) mismatched DNA probes for the relative quantification of epialleles. The assay was developed using fluorescent detection on a gel and then adapted for electrochemical detection on a microfabricated device. NGS was used to validate the analytical accuracy of EpiQ. RESULTS: In this proof of principle study, EpiQ detected with 90%-95% specificity each of the 8 possible epialleles for a 3-CpG cluster at the promoter region of the CDKN2B (p15) tumor suppressor gene. EpiQ successfully profiled heterogeneous methylation patterns in clinically derived samples, and the results were cross-validated with NGS. CONCLUSIONS: EpiQ is a potential alternative tool for characterizing heterogeneous methylation, thus facilitating its use as a biomarker. EpiQ was developed on a gel-based assay but can also easily be adapted for miniaturized chip-based platforms.",7.911,1179

We characterized DNA methylation patterns in callus, primary regenerants, and regenerant-derived progenies of maize using immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA (meDIP) to assess the genome-wide frequency, pattern, and heritability of DNA methylation changes. Although genome-wide DNA methylation levels remained similar following tissue culture, numerous regions exhibited altered DNA methylation levels. Hypomethylation events were observed more frequently than hypermethylation following tissue culture. Many of the hypomethylation events occur at the same genomic sites across independent regenerants and cell lines. The DNA methylation changes were often heritable in progenies produced from self-pollination of primary regenerants. Methylation changes were enriched in regions upstream of genes and loss of DNA methylation at promoters was associated with altered expression at a subset of loci. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) found in tissue culture regenerants overlap with the position of naturally occurring DMRs more often than expected by chance with 8% of tissue culture hypomethylated DMRs overlapping with DMRs identified by profiling natural variation, consistent with the hypotheses that genomic stresses similar to those causing somaclonal variation may also occur in nature, and that certain loci are particularly susceptible to epigenetic change in response to these stresses. The consistency of methylation changes across regenerants from independent cultures suggests a mechanistic response to the culture environment as opposed to an overall loss of fidelity in the maintenance of epigenetic states.",5.963,1460

Genetic variants of OAS1 were previously found to be associated with susceptibility to West Nile virus infections in horses. The subject of the study were white blood cells of 13 juvenile and 13 old horses from AA and HC breed and a set of solid tissues from a single adult horse. The aim was to determine the degree of variation of CpG methylation profiles with concern for tissue type, horse breed and age. Results of direct BSPCR and cloned BSPCR sequencing revealed that all of determined CpG islands (CGIs) were hypermethylated in exception to CGI covering OAS1 promoter and exon 1. One of intragenic CGIs displayed variability of methylation patterns across eight tissue types. The variability of particular sub-types of white blood cells between AA and HC horses were considered as the possible cause of interbreed differences of methylation levels. Comparison of sequence variability between converted and unconverted DNAs of both horse breeds showed polymorphisms of CpG sites to be the source of monoallelic methylation in exception to the polymorphic CpGs located in the OAS1 promoter. Two of them are new polymorphic variants in the OAS1 promoter region. Application of methylation data in conjunction with genetic variation detected at the OAS1 locus might be useful to deepen the knowledge about mechanisms underlying immunity to viral infections in the horse.",1.477,982

DNA methylation is important for the function of embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells (such as haematopoietic stem cells, neural stem cells and germline stem cells), and changes in DNA methylation patterns are essential for successful nuclear reprogramming. In the past several years, the rediscovery of hydroxymethylation and the TET enzymes expanded our insights tremendously and uncovered more dynamic aspects of cytosine methylation regulation. Here, we review the current knowledge and highlight the most recent advances in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and several well-studied adult stems cells. Our current understanding of stem cell epigenetics and new advances in the field will undoubtedly stimulate further clinical applications of regenerative medicine in the future.",2.005,520

Timely and accurate regulation of DDR proteins is required for distinct DNA damage repair pathways. Post-translational modifications of histone and non-histone proteins play a vital role in the DDR factor foci formation and signaling pathway. Phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, neddylation, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, acetylation, and methylation are all involved in the spatial-temporal regulation of DDR, among which phosphorylation and ubiquitylation are well studied. Studies in the past decade also revealed extensive roles of lysine methylation in response to DNA damage. Lysine methylation is finely regulated by plenty of lysine methyltransferases, lysine demethylases, and can be recognized by proteins with chromodomain, plant homeodomain, Tudor domain, malignant brain tumor domain, or proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline domain. In this review, we outline the dynamics and regulation of histone lysine methylation at canonical (H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, and H4K20) and non-canonical sites after DNA damage, and discuss their context-specific functions in DDR protein recruitment or extraction, chromatin environment establishment, and transcriptional regulation.

For instance, in utero lead (Pb) exposure is a neurodevelopmental toxicant of global concern that has also been linked to altered growth in human epidemiological cohorts; a potential mechanism of this association is through alteration of DNA methylation (e.g., at growth-related genes). However, because the associations between toxicants and DNA methylation might be weak, using appropriate quality control and statistical methods is important to increase reliability and power of such studies. Using a simulation study, we compared potential approaches to estimate toxicant-DNA methylation associations that varied by how methylation data were analyzed (repeated measures vs. averaging all CpG sites) and by method to adjust for batch effects (batch controls vs. random effects). We demonstrate that correcting for batch effects using plate controls yields unbiased associations, and that explicitly modeling the CpG site-specific variances and correlations among CpG sites increases statistical power. Using the recommended approaches, we examined the association between DNA methylation (in LINE-1 and growth related genes IGF2, H19 and HSD11B2) and 3 biomarkers of Pb exposure (Pb concentrations in umbilical cord blood, maternal tibia, and maternal patella), among mother-infant pairs of the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort (n = 247). Those with 10 mug/g higher patella Pb had, on average, 0.61% higher IGF2 methylation (P = 0.05).

Their methylation status in surrounding normal breast tissues has not been examined thoroughly although this may well be important for a better understanding of breast carcinogenesis. In this study, BRCA1 and GSTP1 promoter methylation was examined by methylation-specific PCR assay. Patients with BRCA1-methylated (n = 15) or BRCA1-unmethylated (n = 15) tumors and those with GSTP1-methylated (n = 9) or GSTP1-unmethylated (n = 11) tumors were included in the present study. Methylation status of manually micro-dissected normal epithelial cells from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of normal breast tissues adjacent to and distant from the tumors was examined at multiple sites (n = 1-5). Of the 15 patients with BRCA1-methylated tumors, 9 harbored BRCA1 promoter methylation in at least one site of the normal breast tissues. However, no BRCA1 promoter methylation was observed at any site of the normal tissues of the 15 patients with BRCA1-unmethylated tumors. No GSTP1 promoter methylation was observed in the normal tissues regardless of the methylation status of the tumors. The presence of BRCA1 promoter methylation in the normal tissues was confirmed in the epithelial cells enriched with the magnetic-activated cell sorting method. Our findings suggest that a small proportion of normal breast epithelial cells with BRCA1 promoter methylation can be precursor cells from which BRCA1-methylated breast tumors may originate. This does not apply to GSTP1 promoter methylation.",3.523,1331

In a previous study, we demonstrated that FOXF2 is specifically expressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells and functions as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition suppressor. FOXF2 deficiency enhances the metastatic ability of BLBC cells through activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program, but reduces cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that CpG island methylation of the FOXF2 proximal promoter region is involved in the regulatory mechanism of the subtype-specific expression of FOXF2 in breast cancer cells. DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B commonly or individually contributed to this DNA methylation in different breast cancer cells. SP1 regulated the transcriptional activity of FOXF2 through direct binding to the proximal promoter region, whereas this binding was abrogated through DNA methylation. FOXF2 mediated the SP1-regulated suppression of progression and promotion of proliferation of non-methylated BLBC cells. Thus, we conclude that the subtype-specific expression and function of FOXF2 in breast cancer cells are regulated through the combined effects of DNA methylation and SP1 transcriptional regulation.",0,842

This silencing is overturned during the switch to the lytic cycle. A key event is the production of the viral protein Zta which binds to three Zta-response elements (ZRE) from the Rta promoter (Rp), two of which (ZRE2 and ZRE3) include three CpG motifs methylated in the latent genome. The bisulphite pyrosequencing reaction was used to quantify the methylation of ZRE2, ZRE3a, and ZRE3b in EBV-positive cell lines and in ex vivo samples of EBV-related diseases, in order to assess whether the level of methylation in these ZREs could provide additional information to viral DNA load and serology in the characterization of EBV-associated diseases. In PBMC from two patients with infectious mononucleosis, over time Rp became increasingly methylated whereas EBV load decreased. In tonsil from patients with chronic tonsillitis, the methylation was less than in EBV-associated tumors, regardless of the viral load. This was even more striking when only the ZRE3a and ZRE3b were considered since some samples presented unbalanced profiles on ZRE2. EBV reactivation in cell culture showed that the reduction in the overall level of methylation was closely related to the production of unmethylated virions. Thus, an assessment of the level of methylation may help to better characterize EBV replication in PBMC and in biopsies with high EBV load, during infectious mononucleosis and EBV-associated cancers.

The assay was carried out on a DNA capture probe modified 96-cell microplate with four sequential steps of target recognition, endonuclease-based digestion, isothermal HRCA, and enzyme-catalyzed colorimetric readout within 3h. The semi-quantitative and precise analysis of methylated DNA could be easily achieved by naked eye and absorbance measurements, respectively. The strategy exhibited excellent detection specificity and accuracy with a log-linear response to methylated DNA from 100 fM to 10nM. As a proof of concept, the assay was applied to investigate the methylation status of p16/CDKN2 promoter of breast cancer patients. The methylated p16 concentration was not significantly associated with the clinical parameters. The proposed method allowed efficient methylation detection with simplicity, rapidness, low cost and high sensitivity, showing great promise for application in early diagnosis of methylation-related diseases.",6.409,1549

In unfavorable environments, cells enter a nonproliferative state termed quiescence but rapidly return to the cell cycle once conditions support energetic needs. Changing cellular metabolite pools are proposed to directly alter the epigenome via histone acetylation. Here we studied the relationship between histone modification dynamics and the dramatic transcriptional changes that occur during nutrient-induced cell cycle reentry from quiescence in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based mass spectrometry showed that histone methylation-in contrast to histone acetylation-is surprisingly static during quiescence exit. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed genome-wide shifts in histone acetylation at growth and stress genes as cells exit quiescence and transcription dramatically changes. Strikingly, however, the patterns of histone methylation remain intact. We conclude that the functions of histone methylation and acetylation are remarkably distinct during quiescence exit: acetylation rapidly responds to metabolic state, while methylation is independent. Thus, the initial burst of growth gene reactivation emerging from quiescence involves dramatic increases of histone acetylation but not of histone methylation.",4.777,536

The genetically stable in vitro regenerates were raised through direct organogenesis via enhanced axillary shoot bud proliferation (Protocol-1) and in vitro-derived leaf regeneration (Protocol-2). Ten selective combinations of MS-AFLP primers produced 462 and 477 MS-AFLP bands in Protocol-1 (P-1) and Protocol-2 (P-2) regenerates, respectively. In P-1 regenerates, 15.8-31.17 % DNA was found methylated with an average of 25.24 %. In P-2 regenerates, 15.93-32.7 % DNA was found methylated with an average of 24.11 %. Using MS-AFLP in P-1 and P-2 regenerates, 11.52-25.53 % and 13.33-25.47 % polymorphism in methylated DNA was reported, respectively. Compared to the mother plant, P-1 regenerates showed hyper-methylation while P-2 showed hypo-methylation. The results clearly indicated alternation in degree and pattern of DNA methylation; hence, epigenetic instability in the genetically stable in vitro regenerates of J. curcas, developed so far using two different regeneration systems and explants of two different origins. The homologous nucleotide fragments in genomes of P-1 and P-2 regenerates showing methylation re-patterning might be involved in immediate adaptive responses and developmental processes through differential regulation of transcriptome under in vitro conditions.",1.735,965

Analysis of the 450k methylation array data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicated that the SCT promoter region is differentially hypermethylated in lung cancer. Our purpose was to validate SCT methylation as a potential biomarker for lung cancer. METHODS: We analyzed data from TCGA and developed and applied SCT-specific bisulfite DNA sequencing and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The analyses of TCGA 450K data for 801 samples showed that SCT hypermethylation has an area under the curve (AUC) value greater than 0.98 that can be used to distinguish lung adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas from nonmalignant lung tissue. Bisulfite sequencing of lung cancer cell lines and normal blood cells allowed us to confirm that SCT methylation is highly discriminative. By applying a quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay, we found that SCT hypermethylation is frequently detected in all major subtypes of malignant non-small cell lung cancer (AUC = 0.92, n = 108) and small cell lung cancer (AUC = 0.93, n = 40) but is less frequent in lung carcinoids (AUC = 0.54, n = 20). SCT hypermethylation appeared in samples of lung carcinoma in situ during multistage pathogenesis and increased in invasive samples. Further analyses of TCGA 450k data showed that SCT hypermethylation is highly discriminative in most other types of malignant tumors but less frequent in low-grade malignant tumors. The only normal tissue with a high level of methylation was the placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that SCT methylation is a highly discriminative biomarker for lung and other malignant tumors, is less frequent in low-grade malignant tumors (including lung carcinoids), and appears at the carcinoma in situ stage.",1.783,993

We sought to improve existing protein-coding gene and microRNA expression prognostic classifiers by incorporating epigenetic biomarkers. METHODS: Genome-wide screening of DNA methylation and pyrosequencing analysis of HOXA9 promoter methylation were performed in two independently collected cohorts of stage I lung adenocarcinoma. The prognostic value of HOXA9 promoter methylation alone and in combination with mRNA and miRNA biomarkers was assessed by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in both cohorts. RESULTS: Promoters of genes marked by polycomb in embryonic stem cells were methylated de novo in tumors and identified patients with poor prognosis. The HOXA9 locus was methylated de novo in stage I tumors (p < 0.0005). High HOXA9 promoter methylation was associated with worse cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; p = 0.02) and recurrence-free survival (HR, 3.0; p = 0.01), and identified high-risk patients in stratified analysis of stages IA and IB. Four protein-coding gene (XPO1, BRCA1, HIF1alpha, and DLC1), miR-21 expression, and HOXA9 promoter methylation were each independently associated with outcome (HR, 2.8; p = 0.002; HR, 2.3; p = 0.01; and HR, 2.4; p = 0.005, respectively), and when combined, identified high-risk, therapy naive, stage I patients (HR, 10.2; p = 3 x 10).

We assessed if genes with a plausible influence on growth could be aberrantly methylated in placental samples from pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). METHODS: A candidate gene approach was undertaken using a custom Illumina Goldengate(R) array on a collection of placental samples from growth restricted pregnancies and normally grown controls with confirmation using bisulphite pyrosequencing. RESULTS: The custom array analysis revealed that the promoter of RASSF1A was the only region with significant methylation differences between IUGR placentas and those from pregnancies with appropriate growth for gestational age (AGA). The RASSF1A promoter had increased levels of DNA methylation in IUGR samples compared to controls. Interestingly, the methylation difference was also observed in preeclamptic samples. Higher methylation was associated with a concomitant decrease in expression of the RASSF1 transcript A, but not other isoforms that originate from an alternative, nearby promoter interval. DISCUSSION: Our results do not support the hypothesis that altered DNA-methylation in the placenta is a mechanism generally involved in fetal growth restriction. A specific region corresponding to the promoter of RASSF1A does display methylation changes in placenta that could be used to identify at-risk pregnancies.",2.71,485

The regulatory effect of CBY in this signaling pathway suggests its biological importance as a potential tumor suppressor gene. The purposes of this study were to determine whether the expression of CBY was downregulated in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) samples, the CpG sites of CBY at the promoter region were methylated in these tumor samples, and reduced expression of CBY was induced by methylation of CBY promoters. METHODS: CBY expression was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry in samples from 36 LSCC patients. The methylation status of the CBY promoter was detected by methylation-specific PCR. RESULTS: Compared with normal laryngeal mucosa, the expression of CBY was downregulated in LSCC samples. The reduced CBY expression rate was 58.33% (21/36) at the mRNA and 66.67% (24/36) at the protein level. The promoters of CBY were methylated in 12/36 tumor samples, partially methylated in 5, and unmethylated in 19 samples. The methylation rate including incomplete methylation was 47.22% (17/36) in tumor samples, while no methylation was detected in normal laryngeal squamous epithelium. Compared with the unmethylated group, the expression of CBY was significantly different in the methylated group (p&lt;0.05) but similar in the partially methylated group (p&gt;0.05).

We have previously reported that altered DNA methylation patterns are of biological and clinical importance in HB. In the present study, using genome-wide methylation analysis and bisulfite pyrosequencing with specimens from HB tumors, we detected nine methylated genes. We then focused on four of those genes, GPR180, MST1R, OCIAD2, and PARP6, because they likely encode tumor suppressors and their increase of methylation was associated with a poor prognosis. The methylation status of the four genes was also associated with age at diagnosis, and significant association with the presence of metastatic tumors was seen in three of the four genes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of metastatic tumors and increase of methylation of GPR180 were independent prognostic factors affecting event-free survival. These findings indicate that the four novel tumor suppressor candidates are potentially useful molecular markers predictive of a poor outcome in HB patients, which may serve as the basis for improved therapeutic strategies when clinical trials are carried out.",3.523,1677

Mammalian somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos with reprogramming defects fail to develop. Thus, we compared DNA methylation reprogramming in preimplantation embryos from bovine SCNT and in vitro fertilization (IVF) and analyzed the influence of vitamin C (VC) on the reprogramming of DNA methylation. The results showed that global DNA methylation followed a typical pattern of demethylation and remethylation in IVF preimplantation embryos; however, the global genome remained hypermethylated in SCNT preimplantation embryos. Compared with the IVF group, locus DNA methylation reprogramming showed three patterns in the SCNT group. First, some pluripotency genes (POU5F1 and NANOG) and repeated elements (satellite I and alpha-satellite) showed insufficient demethylation and hypermethylation in the SCNT group. Second, a differentially methylated region (DMR) of an imprint control region (ICR) in H19 exhibited excessive demethylation and hypomethylation. Third, some pluripotency genes (CDX2 and SOX2) were hypomethylated in both the IVF and SCNT groups. Additionally, VC improved the DNA methylation reprogramming of satellite I, alpha-satellite and H19 but not that of POU5F1 and NANOG in SCNT preimplantation embryos. These results indicate that DNA methylation reprogramming was aberrant and that VC influenced DNA methylation reprogramming in SCNT embryos in a locus-specific manner.",5.578,931

However, current classifiers based on absolute methylation values detected from a cohort of samples are typically difficult to be transferable to other cohorts of samples. Here, focusing on relative methylation levels, we employed a modified rank-based method to extract reversal pairs of CpG sites whose relative methylation level orderings differ between disease samples and normal controls for cancer diagnosis. The reversal pairs identified for five cancer types respectively show excellent prediction performance with the accuracy above 95%. Furthermore, when evaluating the reversal pairs identified for one cancer type in an independent cohorts of samples, we found that they could distinguish different subtypes of this cancer or different malignant stages including early stage of this cancer from normal controls. The identified reversal pairs also appear to be specific to cancer type. In conclusion, the reversal pairs detected by the rank-based method could be used for accurate cancer diagnosis, which are transferable to independent cohorts of samples.",2.138,1771

Previous studies have investigated its genetic basis by mapping genetic variants that are associated with DNA methylation at specific sites, but these have been limited to microarrays that cover <2% of the genome and cannot account for allele-specific methylation (ASM). Other studies have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a few individuals, but these lack statistical power to identify variants associated with DNA methylation. We present a novel approach in which bisulfite-treated DNA from many individuals is sequenced together in a single pool, resulting in a truly genome-wide map of DNA methylation. Compared to methods that do not account for ASM, our approach increases statistical power to detect associations while sharply reducing cost, effort, and experimental variability. As a proof of concept, we generated deep sequencing data from a pool of 60 human cell lines; we evaluated almost twice as many CpGs as the largest microarray studies and identified more than 2000 genetic variants associated with DNA methylation. We found that these variants are highly enriched for associations with chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding but are less likely to be associated with traits indirectly linked to DNA, such as gene expression and disease phenotypes. In summary, our approach allows genome-wide mapping of genetic variants associated with DNA methylation in any tissue of any species, without the need for individual-level genotype or methylation data.",14.63,547
25537884,Global analysis of methylation profiles from high resolution CpG data.,"['Zhao N', 'Bell DA', 'Maity A', 'Staicu AM', 'Joubert BR', 'London SJ', 'Wu MC']",Genetic epidemiology,2015,"New high throughput technologies are now enabling simultaneous epigenetic profiling of DNA methylation at hundreds of thousands of CpGs across the genome. A problem of considerable practical interest is identification of large scale, global changes in methylation that are associated with environmental variables, clinical outcomes, or other experimental conditions. However, there has been little statistical research on methods for global methylation analysis using technologies with individual CpG resolution. To address this critical gap in the literature, we develop a new strategy for global analysis of methylation profiles using a functional regression approach wherein we approximate either the density or the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the methylation values for each individual using B-spline basis functions. The spline coefficients for each individual are allowed to summarize the individual's overall methylation profile. We then test for association between the overall distribution and a continuous or dichotomous outcome variable using a variance component score test that naturally accommodates the correlation between spline coefficients. Simulations indicate that our proposed approach has desirable power while protecting type I error. The method was applied to detect methylation differences, both genome wide and at LINE1 elements, between the blood samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls and to detect the epigenetic changes of human hepatocarcinogenesis in the context of alcohol abuse and hepatitis C virus infection. A free implementation of our methods in the R language is available in the Global Analysis of Methylation Profiles (GAMP) package at http://research.fhcrc.org/wu/en.html.",2.597,1021

However, little is known about exercise-related epigenetic processes in the horse. DNA methylation is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes. We carried out comparative genomic analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in the blood samples of two different thoroughbred horses before and after exercise by methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the pre-and post-exercise blood samples of superior and inferior horses were identified. Exercise altered the methylation patterns. After 30 min of exercise, 596 genes were hypomethylated and 715 genes were hypermethylated in the superior horse, whereas in the inferior horse, 868 genes were hypomethylated and 794 genes were hypermethylated. These genes were analyzed based on gene ontology (GO) annotations and the exercise-related pathway patterns in the two horses were compared. After exercise, gene regions related to cell division and adhesion were hypermethylated in the superior horse, whereas regions related to cell signaling and transport were hypermethylated in the inferior horse. Analysis of the distribution of methylated CpG islands confirmed the hypomethylation in the gene-body methylation regions after exercise. The methylation patterns of transposable elements also changed after exercise. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) showed abundance of DMRs. Collectively, our results serve as a basis to study exercise-based reprogramming of epigenetic traits.",2.09,889

In this study, microRNA 320a (miR-320a) was found to be down-regulated in chemoresistant cancer cells. MiR-320a directly targeted TRPC5 and NFATC3, and down-regulation of miR-320a triggered TRPC5 and NFATC3 overexpression. In chemoresistant cells, down-regulation of miR-320a was associated with regulation by methylation, which implicated promoter methylation of the miR-320a coding sequence. Furthermore, the transcription factor v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS-1), which inhibited miR-320a expression, was activated in chemoresistant cancer cells; such activation was associated with hypomethylation of the ETS-1 promoter. Lastly, the down-regulation of miR-320a and high expression of TRPC5, NFATC3, and ETS-1 were verified in clinically chemoresistant samples. Low expression of MiR-320a was also found to be a significant unfavorable predictor for clinic outcome. In conclusion, miR-320a is a mediator of chemoresistance by targeting TRPC5 and NFATC3. Expression of miR-320a is regulated by methylation of its promoter and that of ETS-1.",4.128,1736

METHOD: Scientific literature databases were exhaustively searched to retrieve published studies relevant to DAPK methylation and NSCLC. Retrieved studies published in English and Chinese languages were screened according to the stringent predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and high quality studies were selected for meta-analysis. All statistical analyses were performed utilizing STATA software (Version 12.0, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: A total of 14 published studies (5 in English and 9 in Chinese) were enrolled in the present meta-analysis, and contained 1238 patients with NSCLC. The results indicated that NSCLC patients with metastatic phenotype were strongly associated with significantly higher methylation rate of DAPK compared to NSCLC patients without metastasis. Additionally, in NSCLC patients carrying tumors with DAPK methylation, the 5-year survival rate was remarkedly lower than NSCLC patients without DAPK methylation. However, we did not find significant correlation between DAPK methylation and histological stage or tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage in NSCLC patients. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis results reveal that DAPK promoter methylation might be associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in NSCLC patients, although no correlation with histological types and TNM stage in NSCLC patients were found.",1.721,1199

The current study aimed to test the molecular mechanism by which PAR2 promotes cancer cell migration. In different cancer cells, activation of PAR2 by activating peptide (PAR2-AP) dramatically increased cell migration, whereas knock down of PAR2 inhibited cellular motility. The PAR2 activation also repressed miR-125b expression while miR-125b mimic successfully blocked PAR2-induced cell migration. Moreover, Grb associated-binding protein 2 (Gab2) was identified as a novel target gene of miR-125b and it mediated PAR2-induced cell migration. The correlation of PAR2 with miR-125b and Gab2 was further supported by the findings obtained from human colorectal carcinoma specimens. Remarkably, knock down of NOP2/Sun domain family, member 2 (NSun2), a RNA methyltransferase, blocked the reduction in miR-125b induced by PAR2. Furthermore, PAR2 activation increased the level of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A)-containing pre-miR-125b in NSun2-dependent manner. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-125b mediates PAR2-induced cancer cell migration by targeting Gab2 and that NSun2-dependent RNA methylation contributes to the down-regulation of miR-125b by PAR2 signaling. These findings suggest a novel epigenetic mechanism by which microenvironment regulates cancer cell migration by altering miRNA expression.",0,492

Here we report that early exposure to dietary omega-3 fatty acids orchestrates key interactions between metabolic signals and Bdnf methylation creating a reservoir of neuroplasticity that can protect the brain against the deleterious effects of switching to a Western diet (WD). We observed that the switch to a WD increased Bdnf methylation specific to exon IV, in proportion to anxiety-like behavior, in Sprague Dawley rats reared in low omega-3 fatty acid diet, and these effects were abolished by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Blocking methylation also counteracted the reducing action of WD on the transcription regulator CTCF binding to Bdnf promoter IV. In vitro studies confirmed that CTCF binding to Bdnf promoter IV is essential for the action of DHA on BDNF regulation. Diet is also intrinsically associated to cell metabolism, and here we show that the switch to WD downregulated cell metabolism (NAD/NADH ratio and SIRT1). The fact that DNA methyltransferase inhibitor did not alter these parameters suggests they occur upstream to methylation. In turn, the methylation inhibitor counteracted the action of WD on PGC-1alpha, a mitochondrial transcription co-activator and BDNF regulator, suggesting that PGC-1alpha is an effector of Bdnf methylation.

This study evaluates a biomarker panel for the diagnosis of CCA by DNA methylation analyses of biliary brush samples. The methylation status of 13 candidate genes (CDO1, CNRIP1, DCLK1, FBN1, INA, MAL, SEPT9, SFRP1, SNCA, SPG20, TMEFF2, VIM, and ZSCAN18) was investigated in 93 tissue samples (39 CCAs and 54 nonmalignant controls) using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The 13 genes were further analyzed in a test series of biliary brush samples (15 CCAs and 20 nonmalignant primary sclerosing cholangitis controls), and the methylation status of the four best performing markers was validated (34 CCAs and 34 primary sclerosing cholangitis controls). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to evaluate the performance of individual biomarkers and the combination of biomarkers. The 13 candidate genes displayed a methylation frequency of 26%-82% in tissue samples. The four best-performing genes (CDO1, CNRIP1, SEPT9, and VIM) displayed individual methylation frequencies of 45%-77% in biliary brushes from CCA patients. Across the test and validation biliary brush series, this four-gene biomarker panel achieved a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 98%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.944.

There is no clear understanding of the epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and of the potential role of DNA methylation markers as prognostic biomarkers. Analysis of tumor tissue from 304 patients with HCC treated with surgical resection allowed us to generate a methylation-based prognostic signature using a training-validation scheme. Methylome profiling was done with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA), which covers 96% of known cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands and 485,000 CpG, and transcriptome profiling was performed with Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Plate (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and miRNA Chip 2.0. Random survival forests enabled us to generate a methylation signature based on 36 methylation probes. We computed a risk score of mortality for each individual that accurately discriminated patient survival both in the training (221 patients; 47% hepatitis C-related HCC) and validation sets (n = 83; 47% alcohol-related HCC). This signature correlated with known predictors of poor outcome and retained independent prognostic capacity of survival along with multinodularity and platelet count. The subset of patients identified by this signature was enriched in the molecular subclass of proliferation with progenitor cell features. The study confirmed a high prevalence of genes known to be deregulated by aberrant methylation in HCC (e.g., Ras association [RalGDS/AF-6] domain family member 1, insulin-like growth factor 2, and adenomatous polyposis coli) and other solid tumors (e.g., NOTCH3) and describes potential candidate epidrivers (e.g., septin 9 and ephrin B2).

Identification of methylation sites is prerequisite for decoding methylation regulatory networks in living cells and understanding their physiological roles. Experimental methods are limitations of labor-intensive and time-consuming. While in silicon approaches are cost-effective and high-throughput manner to predict potential methylation sites, but those previous predictors only have a mixed model and their prediction performances are not fully satisfactory now. Recently, with increasing availability of quantitative methylation datasets in diverse species (especially in eukaryotes), there is a growing need to develop a species-specific predictor. Here, we designed a tool named PSSMe based on information gain (IG) feature optimization method for species-specific methylation site prediction. The IG method was adopted to analyze the importance and contribution of each feature, then select the valuable dimension feature vectors to reconstitute a new orderly feature, which was applied to build the finally prediction model. Finally, our method improves prediction performance of accuracy about 15% comparing with single features. Furthermore, our species-specific model significantly improves the predictive performance compare with other general methylation prediction tools.

Genetics,2015,"Age prediction of an individual based on biological traces remained in a crime scene is of ultimate importance for criminal investigation. Growing evidence indicates that some CpG sites may have age-related methylation changes and thus may be a promising tool for age prediction. In this study, we utilized the pyrosequencing approach to screen age-related CpG (AR-CpG) sites for age prediction. Five AR-CpGs were identified as age-related markers from thirty-eight candidates, among which three CpG sites, ITGA2B_1, NPTX2_3, and NPTX2_4 were never reported in previous studies. We fit a linear regression model for age prediction based on methylation assay for 89 blood samples from donors aged 9-75 years old. The model included four AR-CpG markers in three gene fragments ASPA, ITGA2B and NPTX2 and enabled the age prediction with R(2)=0.819. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) from chronological age of the model was 7.870. We validated the linear regression model with a validation set of 40 blood samples, and the prediction MAD was 7.986. There was no statistically significant difference in age prediction between 20 pairs of blood samples and bloodstains. Six pairs of fresh and old bloodstains were analyzed using our assay. The obtained results showed the assay still performed an effective prediction on bloodstains after four-month storage in room conditions.

Methylation of 8 CpG dinucleotides (CpG1-8) in the AGTR1 promoter was examined using the bisulphite pyrosequencing technology. Three CpG dinucleotides (CpG6-8) could not be well sequenced, therefore only the remaining 5 CpG sites were analysed. A significantly lower CpG1 methylation level was identified in EH cases than in controls (cases vs. CONTROLS: 6.74 +/- 4.32% vs. 9.66 +/- 5.45%, p = 0.007), and no significant association was observed in the remaining analyses. In addition, significantly lower CpG1 (p = 0.028) and higher CpG2 (p = 0.032) methylation levels were observed in males than in females. In the breakdown association test by gender, a higher CpG1 methylation level was also identified in EH in both males (p = 0.034) and females (p = 0.020). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that CpG1 methylation was a significant predictor of EH. Furthermore, CpG1 methylation was inversely correlated with uric acid levels in controls. The present study suggests that CpG1 hypomethylation in the AGTR1 promoter is likely associated with the risk of EH in the population assessed.",1.561,1145

Differential methylation is now known to play a central role in the development and outcome of most if not all human malignancies.Bisulfite conversion is a commonly used approach for gene-specific DNA methylation analysis. Treatment of DNA with bisulfite converts cytosine to uracil while leaving 5-methylcytosine intact, allowing for single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylated areas of DNA. PCR-based methods are routinely used to study DNA methylation on a gene-specific basis, after bisulfite treatment. Variations of this method include bisulfite sequencing, methylation-specific PCR, real-time PCR-based MethyLight, and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting PCR.

A cohort study of 215 patients with CRC (mean age 64.32 years; 50.5% of men) from Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan examined the association between cancer stage and risk of CRC recurrence and mortality. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze patient methylation status and clinical information at study entry, and their associations with CRC recurrence and mortality during follow-up. The advanced stage patients with p16, hMLH1, and MGMT methylation were associated with higher risk of CRC recurrence compared with the local stage patients with unmethylation status in tumor tissues, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 9.64 (2.92-31.81), 8.29 (3.40-20.22), and 11.83 (3.49-40.12), respectively.

Our results show that amended rice straw enhanced Hg methylation for relatively high Hg content soil, but not for low Hg soil, spiking the same additional fresh Hg. methylmercury (MeHg) concentration was significantly correlated to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and relative abundance of dominant microbes associated with Hg methylation. Similarly, amended rice straw was found to only enhance the potential nitrification rate in soil with relatively high Hg content. These findings provide evidence that amended rice straw differentially modulates Hg methylation and nitrification in Hg contaminated soils possibly resulting from different characteristics in the soil microbial community. This highlights that caution should be taken when returning rice straw to contaminated paddy fields, as this practice may increase the risk of more MeHg production.

Their toxic potential makes it important to have an in-depth understanding of the inflammation and disease that develops due to exposure. Epigenetics is one area of interest that has been quickly developing to assess disease processes due to its ability to change gene expression and thus the lung environment after exposure. In this study, promoter methylation of inflammatory genes (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) was measured after MWCNT exposure using the pyrosequencing assay and found to correlate with initial cytokine production. In addition, methylation of a gene involved in tissue fibrosis (Thy-1) was also altered in a way that matched collagen deposition. In addition to using epigenetics to better understand disease processes, it has also been used as a biomarker of exposure and disease. In this study, global methylation was determined in the lung to ascertain whether MWCNT alter global methylation at the site of exposure and if those alterations coincide with disease development. Then, global methylation levels were determined in the blood to ascertain whether global methylation could be used as a biomarker of exposure in a more easily accessible tissue. Using the LuUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) and 5-Methylcytosine (5-mC) Quantification assay, we found that MWCNT lead to DNA hypomethylation in the lung and blood, which coincided with disease development. This study provides initial data showing that alterations in gene-specific methylation correspond with an inflammatory response to MWCNT exposure. In addition, global DNA methylation in the lung and blood coincides with MWCNT-induced disease development, suggesting its potential as a biomarker of both exposure and disease development.",6.411,1314
26099324,Prediction of promoters and enhancers using multiple DNA methylation-associated features.,[],BMC genomics,2015,"BACKGROUND: Regulatory regions (e.g. promoters and enhancers) play an essential role in human development and disease. Many computational approaches have been developed to predict the regulatory regions using various genomic features such as sequence motifs and evolutionary conservation. However, these DNA sequence-based approaches do not reflect the tissue-specific nature of the regulatory regions. In this work, we propose to predict regulatory regions using multiple features derived from DNA methylation profile. RESULTS: We discovered several interesting features of the methylated CpG (mCpG) sites within regulatory regions. First, a hypomethylation status of CpGs within regulatory regions, compared to the genomic background methylation level, extended out >1000 bp from the center of the regulatory regions, demonstrating a high degree of correlation between the methylation statuses of neighboring mCpG sites. Second, when a regulatory region was inactive, as determined by histone mark differences between cell lines, methylation level of the mCpG site increased from a hypomethylated state to a hypermethylated state, the level of which was even higher than the genomic background. Third, a distinct set of sequence motifs was overrepresented surrounding mCpG sites within regulatory regions. Using 5 types of features derived from DNA methylation profiles, we were able to predict promoters and enhancers using machine-learning approach (support vector machine). The performances for prediction of promoters and enhancers are quite well, showing an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.992 and 0.817, respectively, which is better than that simply based on methylation level, especially for prediction of enhancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DNA methylation features of mCpG sites can be used to predict regulatory regions.",3.986,1156

These data can help researchers to identify epigenetic patterns that are important for carcinogenesis. MethHC integrates data such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, DNA methylation of microRNA gene and microRNA expression to identify correlations between DNA methylation and mRNA/microRNA expression from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), which includes 18 human cancers in more than 6000 samples, 6548 microarrays and 12 567 RNA sequencing data.",9.112,1176

Our aim was to examine the effect of maternal emotional stress and cortisol levels during pregnancy on methylation of imprinted genes, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein, alpha stimulating extra-large (GNASXL), using umbilical cord blood DNA. Maternal depressed mood (Edinburgh Depression Scale; EDS), pregnancy-related anxiety questionnaire (PRAQ) and cortisol day profiles were assessed throughout pregnancy. At birth, a cord blood sample (n = 80) was taken to study DNA methylation of IGF2 DMR0 (differentially methylated region), IGF2 anti-sense (IGF2AS) and GNASXL using Sequenom EpiTYPER. Linear mixed models were used to examine the relationship between DNA methylation and maternal stress, while correcting for confounders. We also studied the association of DNA methylation with the child ponderal index at birth. We found a cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG)-specific association of PRAQ subscales with IGF2 DMR0 (CpG5, P < 0.0001) and GNASXL (CpG11, P = 0.0003), while IGF2AS was associated with maternal EDS scores (CpG33, P = 0.0003) and cortisol levels (CpG33, P = 0.0006; CpG37-38, P = 0.0005). However, there was no association of methylation with ponderal index at birth. In conclusion, maternal stress during pregnancy, as defined by cortisol measurements, EDS and PRAQ scores, is associated with DNA methylation of imprinted genes IGF2 and GNASXL. Our results provide further evidence that prenatal adversity can influence imprinted gene methylation, although future studies are needed to unravel the exact mechanisms.",3.661,1544

DNA methylation is essential for temporal control of myogenic gene expression during myogenesis; however, its role in AChE regulation is not known. The promoter of vertebrate ACHE gene carries highly conserved CG-rich regions, implying its likeliness to be methylated for epigenetic regulation. A DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (5-Aza), was applied onto C2C12 cells throughout the myotube formation. When DNA methylation was inhibited, the promoter activity, transcript expression and enzymatic activity of AChE were markedly increased after day 3 of differentiation, which indicated the putative role of DNA methylation. By bisulfite pyrosequencing, the overall methylation rate was found to peak at day 3 during C2C12 cell differentiation; a SP1 site located at -1826bp upstream of mouse ACHE gene was revealed to be heavily methylated. The involvement of transcriptional factor SP1 in epigenetic regulation of AChE was illustrated here: (i) the SP1-driven transcriptional activity was increased in 5-Aza-treated C2C12 culture; (ii) the binding of SP1 onto the SP1 site of ACHE gene was fully blocked by the DNA methylation; and (iii) the sequence flanking SP1 sites of ACHE gene was precipitated by chromatin immuno-precipitation assay. The findings suggested the role of DNA methylation on AChE transcriptional regulation and provided insight in elucidating the DNA methylation-mediated regulatory mechanism on AChE expression during muscle differentiation.",2.843,567

Most traditional methods for detection of DNA methylation are based on the complex and expensive bisulfite method. In this paper, we report a novel fluorescence method to detect DNA and DNA methylation based on graphene oxide (GO) and restriction endonuclease HpaII. The skillfully designed probe DNA labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and optimized GO concentration keep the probe/target DNA still adsorbed on the GO. After the cleavage action of HpaII the labeled FAM is released from the GO surface and its fluorescence recovers, which could be used to detect DNA in the linear range of 50 pM-50 nM with a detection limit of 43 pM. DNA methylation induced by transmethylase (Mtase) or other chemical reagents prevents HpaII from recognizing and cleaving the specific site; as a result, fluorescence cannot recover. The fluorescence recovery efficiency is closely related to the DNA methylation level, which can be used to detect DNA methylation by comparing it with the fluorescence in the presence of intact target DNA. The method for detection of DNA and DNA methylation is simple, reliable and accurate.",3.545,838

METHODS: We used methylation-specific quantitative melt analysis (MS-QMA) to determine the prevalence of cryptic FM alleles in 2 independent cohorts of male patients (994 from Chile and 2392 from Australia) referred for FXS testing from 2006 to 2013. All MS-QMA-positive cases were retested with commercial triplet primed PCR, methylation-sensitive Southern blot, and a methylation-specific EpiTYPER-based test. RESULTS: All 38 FMs detected with the standard 2-step protocol were detected with MS-QMA. However, MS-QMA identified methylation mosaicism in an additional 15% and 11% of patients in the Chilean and Australian cohorts, respectively, suggesting the presence of a cryptic FM. Of these additional patients, 57% were confirmed to carry cryptic expanded alleles in blood, buccal mucosa, or saliva samples. Further confirmation was provided by identifying premutation (CGG 55-199) alleles in mothers of probands with methylation-sensitive Southern blot. Neurocognitive assessments showed that low-level mosaicism for cryptic FM alleles was associated with cognitive impairment or autism. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of mosaic FM males who have cognitive impairment or autism are not diagnosed with the currently recommended 2-step testing protocol and can be identified with MS-QMA as a first-line test.",7.911,400

However, data on the postnatal stability of such DNAm signatures in childhood, as assessed by Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS), are scarce. Objectives of this study were to investigate DNAm signatures associated with in utero tobacco smoke exposure beyond the 12th week of gestation in whole blood of children at age 5.5 years, to replicate previous findings in young European and American children and to assess their biological role by exploring databases and enrichment analysis. DNA methylation was measured in blood of 366 children of the multicentre European Childhood Obesity Project Study using the Illumina Infinium HM450 Beadchip (HM450K). An EWAS was conducted using linear regression of methylation values at each CpG site against in utero smoke exposure, adjusted for study characteristics, biological and technical effects. Methylation levels at five HM450K probes in MYO1G (cg12803068, cg22132788, cg19089201), CNTNAP2 (cg25949550), and FRMD4A (cg11813497) showed differential methylation that reached epigenome-wide significance according to the false-discovery-rate (FDR) criteria (q-value<0.05). Whereas cg25949550 showed decreased methylation (-2% DNAm ss-value), increased methylation was observed for the other probes (9%: cg12803068; 5%: cg22132788; 4%: cg19089201 and 4%: cg11813497) in exposed relative to non-exposed subjects. This study thus replicates previous findings in children ages 3 to 5, 7 and 17 and confirms the postnatal stability of MYO1G, CNTNAP2 and FRMD4A differential methylation.

26016479,Detection of Cytosine methylation in ancient DNA from five native american populations using bisulfite sequencing.,"['Smith RW', 'Monroe C', 'Bolnick DA']",PloS one,2015,"While cytosine methylation has been widely studied in extant populations, relatively few studies have analyzed methylation in ancient DNA. Most existing studies of epigenetic marks in ancient DNA have inferred patterns of methylation in highly degraded samples using post-mortem damage to cytosines as a proxy for cytosine methylation levels. However, this approach limits the inference of methylation compared with direct bisulfite sequencing, the current gold standard for analyzing cytosine methylation at single nucleotide resolution. In this study, we used direct bisulfite sequencing to assess cytosine methylation in ancient DNA from the skeletal remains of 30 Native Americans ranging in age from approximately 230 to 4500 years before present. Unmethylated cytosines were converted to uracils by treatment with sodium bisulfite, bisulfite products of a CpG-rich retrotransposon were pyrosequenced, and C-to-T ratios were quantified for a single CpG position. We found that cytosine methylation is readily recoverable from most samples, given adequate preservation of endogenous nuclear DNA. In addition, our results indicate that the precision of cytosine methylation estimates is inversely correlated with aDNA preservation, such that samples of low DNA concentration show higher variability in measures of percent methylation than samples of high DNA concentration. In particular, samples in this study with a DNA concentration above 0.015 ng/muL generated the most consistent measures of cytosine methylation. This study presents evidence of cytosine methylation in a large collection of ancient human remains, and indicates that it is possible to analyze epigenetic patterns in ancient populations using direct bisulfite sequencing approaches.",3.234,1159

The present study was designed to investigate the association between the methylation patterns of H19 and SNRPN imprinting control region (ICR) and male infertility and to assess the gene-environment interactions between environmental factors and methylation patterns. A total of 205 DNA samples from 48 oligozoospermia (OZ), 52 asthenozoospermia (AZ), 55 teratozoospermia (TZ) patients, and 50 normozoospermia (NZ) men were analyzed. The mean methylation level of H19-ICR in OZ (80.40% +/- 12.74%) and AZ patients (81.17% +/- 13.18%) was significantly lower than methylation in men with NZ (88.51% +/- 10.54%, P<.001, P<.001, respectively). The mean methylation level of SNRPN-ICR in AZ patients (7.74% +/- 5.71%) and TZ patients (9.33% +/- 5.48%) was significantly higher than in NZ men (6.32% +/- 3.54%, P<.001, P<.001, respectively).

Previous reports of DNA methylation in low/intermediate grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) have suggested that specific patterns of DNA methylation may have a role as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. In view of the aggressive and clinically unpredictable nature of high-grade (HG) NMIBC, and the current shortage of the preferred treatment option (Bacillus:Calmette-Guerin), novel methylation analyses may similarly reveal biomarkers of disease outcome that could risk-stratify patients and guide clinical management at initial diagnosis. METHODS: Promoter-associated CpG island methylation was determined in primary tumour tissue of 36 initial presentation high-grade NMIBCs, 12 low/intermediate-grade NMIBCs and 3 normal bladder controls. The genes HOXA9, ISL1, NKX6-2, SPAG6, ZIC1 and ZNF154 were selected for investigation on the basis of previous reports and/or prognostic utility in low/intermediate-grade NMIBC. Methylation was determined by Pyrosequencing of sodium-bisulphite converted DNA, and then correlated with gene expression using RT-qPCR. Methylation was additionally correlated with tumour behaviour, including tumour recurrence and progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer or metastases. RESULTS: The ISL1 genes' promoter-associated island was more frequently methylated in recurrent and progressive high-grade tumours than their non-recurrent counterparts (60.0% vs. 18.2%, p = 0.008). ISL1 and HOXA9 showed significantly higher mean methylation in recurrent and progressive tumours compared to non-recurrent tumours (43.3% vs. 20.9%, p = 0.016 and 34.5% vs 17.6%, p = 0.017, respectively). Concurrent ISL1/HOXA9 methylation in HG-NMIBC reliably predicted tumour recurrence and progression within one year (Positive Predictive Value 91.7%), and was associated with disease-specific mortality (DSM). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we report methylation differences and similarities between clinical sub-types of high-grade NMIBC. We report the potential ability of methylation biomarkers, at initial diagnosis, to predict tumour recurrence and progression within one year of diagnosis. We found that specific biomarkers reliably predict disease outcome and therefore may help guide patient treatment despite the unpredictable clinical course and heterogeneity of high-grade NMIBC. Further investigation is required, including validation in a larger patient cohort, to confirm the clinical utility of methylation biomarkers in high-grade NMIBC.",3.234,1203
26383849,Dual Functions of the RFTS Domain of Dnmt1 in Replication-Coupled DNA Methylation and in Protection of the Genome from Aberrant Methylation.,"['Garvilles RG', 'Hasegawa T', 'Kimura H', 'Sharif J', 'Muto M', 'Koseki H', 'Takahashi S', 'Suetake I', 'Tajima S']",PloS one,2015,"In mammals, DNA methylation plays important roles in embryogenesis and terminal differentiation via regulation of the transcription-competent chromatin state. The methylation patterns are propagated to the next generation during replication by maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, in co-operation with Uhrf1. In the N-terminal regulatory region, Dnmt1 contains proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding and replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS) domains, which are thought to contribute to maintenance methylation during replication. To determine the contributions of the N-terminal regulatory domains to the DNA methylation during replication, Dnmt1 lacking the RFTS and/or PCNA-binding domains was ectopically expressed in embryonic stem cells, and then the effects were analyzed. Deletion of both the PCNA-binding and RFTS domains did not significantly affect the global DNA methylation level. However, replication-dependent DNA methylation of the differentially methylated regions of three imprinted genes, Kcnq1ot1/Lit1, Peg3, and Rasgrf1, was impaired in cells expressing the Dnmt1 with not the PCNA-binding domain alone but both the PCNA-binding and RFTS domains deleted. Even in the absence of Uhrf1, which is a prerequisite factor for maintenance DNA methylation, Dnmt1 with both the domains deleted apparently maintained the global DNA methylation level, whilst the wild type and the forms containing the RFTS domain could not perform global DNA methylation under the conditions used. This apparent maintenance of the global DNA methylation level by the Dnmt1 lacking the RFTS domain was dependent on its own DNA methylation activity as well as the presence of de novo-type DNA methyltransferases. We concluded that the RFTS domain, not the PCNA-binding domain, is solely responsible for the replication-coupled DNA methylation. Furthermore, the RFTS domain acts as a safety lock by protecting the genome from replication-independent DNA methylation.",3.234,1200

In this study, by testing methylation levels of PAX1 genes in cervical scrapings and cervical tissues of different lesion levels, aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of DNA methylation testing as a biomarker for early detecting cancerous changes in cervical tissues and to compare the efficacy between PAX1 methylation test and HPV test in detecting of cervical cancer. METHODS: A total of 121 cervical scrapings were analyzed, including normal (n = 28), cervical intraepithelial neoplasm 1 (CIN1; n = 32), CIN2/3 (n = 34), and invasive cancer (n = 27), which were all diagnosed by pathologic examination. RESULTS: The values of PAX1 methylation reference in invasive cancer (mean [SE], 26.3 [3.5]) was significantly higher than CIN2/3 (13. 2 [2.2]) and the CIN1 (4.5 [0.45]; P < 0.001). The PAX1 promoter was hypermethylated in 100% of invasive cancer tissue compared with 0% of normal tissue, 9% of CIN1, 44% of CIN2/3 (P < 0.01). Methylation levels of cervical scrapings and cervical tissues represent strong consistency within each group. In contrast, the HPV test result was positive in 17% of normal tissue, 81% of CIN1, 91% of CIN2/CIN3, and 92% of invasive cancer. Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, hypermethylation of PAX1 was a significant candidate in segregating cervical cancer from normal/cervical neoplasia cases (P < 0.001). At an optimal cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity between 80% and 93% were obtained. In conclusion, the current results indicated that the methylation density of PAX1 by pyrosequencing in cervical scrapings held a great promise for cervical cancer screening.",1.891,779

Epidemiological studies have also indicated that gestational arsenic exposure is associated with increased incidences of cancers in several organs, including the bladder and liver, in adulthood. Previous studies have shown that epigenetic changes are involved in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Among epigenetic changes, DNA methylation changes that are specific to arsenic-induced tumors would be useful for distinguishing such tumors from tumors induced by other factors and for clarifying arsenic carcinogenesis. It has been reported that gestational arsenic exposure of C3H mice, whose males tend to spontaneously develop liver tumors, increases the incidence of tumors in the male offspring. Using the same experimental protocol, we found a number of regions where the DNA methylation status was altered in the liver tumors compared with the normal liver tissues by the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-CpG island microarray method. Among such regions, we demonstrated using real-time methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing that a gene body region of the oncogene Fosb underwent alteration in DNA methylation following gestational arsenic exposure. We also showed that the Fosb expression level significantly increased following gestational arsenic exposure. These findings suggest that the DNA methylation status of the Fosb region is implicated in tumor augmentation and can also be utilized for characterizing tumors induced by gestational arsenic exposure.",0,1649

Information on BCL2-IGH rearrangement and clinical characteristics were available for all patients. Aberrant DAPK1 methylation was found in 22 of 26 (85%) lymph node biopsy samples, 62 of 107 (58%) BM specimens, and 25 of 63 (40%) peripheral blood samples at diagnosis. DAPK1 methylation was greater in patients with BM infiltration and a higher Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score. The presence of aberrant DAPK1 methylation in BM significantly reduced progression-free survival following immunochemotherapy, independent of Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score.

We investigated associations of methyl micronutrient intake and plasma total homocysteine with LINE-1 and Alu methylation in a cross-sectional study of 987 adults aged 45-84 y who participated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Stress Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA methylation was estimated using pyrosequencing technology. A 120-item food frequency questionnaire was used to ascertain daily intake of folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, zinc, and methionine. Plasma total homocysteine was quantified using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Associations of micronutrient intake and homocysteine with LINE-1 and Alu methylation were examined using linear regression. Adjusted differences in %5-methylated cytosines (%5 mC) were examined by categories of predictors using multivariable linear regression models. Intake of methyl-donor micronutrients was not associated with DNA methylation. After adjustment for covariates, each 3 mumol/L increment of homocysteine corresponded with 0.06 (-0.01, 0.13) %5 mC higher LINE-1 methylation. Additionally, BMI was positively associated with LINE-1 methylation (P trend = 0.03). Participants with BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2) had 0.35 (0.03, 0.67) %5 mC higher LINE-1 than those with normal BMI. We also observed a 0.10 (0.02, 0.19) %5 mC difference in Alu methylation per 10 cm of height. These associations did not differ by sex.

We therefore assessed whether the HIF3A methylation is associated with obesity and other obesity-related phenotypes in Chinese children. The subjects included 110 severe obese cases aged 7-17y and 110 normal-weight controls matched by age and gender for measurement of blood DNA methylation levels at the HIF3A gene locus using the Sequenom's MassARRAY system. We observed significantly higher methylation levels in obese children than in controls at positions 46801642 and 46801699 in HIF3A gene (P<0.05), and found positive associations between methylation and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels adjusted by gender, age and BMI at the position 46801699 (r = 0.226, P = 0.007). These results suggest that HIF3A DNA methylation is associated with childhood obesity, and has a BMI-independent association with ALT. The results provide evidence for identifying epigenetic factors of elivated ALT and may be useful for risk assessment and personalized medicine of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",3.234,1194

For female with methylation level at (+89, +94, +96) CpG unit below 3.50 %, the probability of being a migraine patient was significantly higher than those with methylation level above the threshold (OR: 7.313; 95%CI: 1.439-37.164). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that DNA methylation at RAMP1 promoter might play a role in migraine. A low methylation trend overall was presented in migraine subjects, and two CpG units were observed to link with positive migraine family history and female migraine, respectively. Lower methlytion level at (+89, +94, +96) CpG unit may be a risk of migraine in females.",0,818
27347077,gene methylation status is associated with male infertility.,"['Li XP', 'Hao CL', 'Wang Q', 'Yi XM', 'Jiang ZS']",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2016,"The present study investigated the H19 gene methylation status in male infertility. Between March 2013 and June 2014, semen samples were collected from 15 normal fertile males and 15 males experiencing infertility, and routine analysis and sperm morphological assessment were performed. The semen samples were subjected to density gradient centrifugation to separate the sperm fraction, and genomic DNA from the sperms was extracted and treated for bisulfite modification. Following in vitro amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the purified PCR products were cloned into pMD(R)18-T vectors and successful cloning was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Positive clones were sequenced and the DNA methylation status was analyzed. The overall methylation rate in the normal fertile group was 100% (270/270), whereas in the infertile group the methylation rate was lower at 94.1% (525/558), revealing a statistically significant decrease in overall methylation rate in the infertile patients compared with the control group (chi2=15.12; P<0.001). The average methylation rates of CpG 1, 3 and 6 in the infertile group were statistically different from those in the normal control group (all P<0.05). The abnormal methylation of imprinted gene H19 is associated with male infertility, suggesting that H19 may serve as a biomarker for the detection of defects in human spermiogenesis.",1.269,531

Glucokinase (GCK) is a key enzyme involved in glucose metabolism. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether GCK gene-body methylation contributed to the risk of EH. A total of 47 patients with EH and 47 age-matched controls were recruited for methylation research in the current study. GCK gene-body methylation was measured using bisulphite pyrosequencing technology. DNA methylation levels were closely correlated among CpG1, CpG2 and CpG3 (r>0.70; P<0.001), in contrast with a weaker correlation between CpG4 and the preceding three CpGs (r<0.3 or r=1; P>0.05). Significantly lower CpG13 methylation (cases vs. controls, 49.13 +/- 5.72 vs. 53.49 +/- 7.53%; adjusted P=0.006) and significantly higher CpG4 methylation (cases vs. controls, 46.34 +/- 6.48 vs. 34.74 +/- 12.73%; adjusted P=0.002) were observed in patients with EH. The present study indicated that aberrant methylation of the GCK gene body was significantly associated with the risk of EH in the population assessed. The discrepancies between CpG13 and CpG4 methylation may suggest distinct roles for each of them in the determination of the risk of EH.",1.554,371

Trypanosomes encode five protein arginine methyltransferases, suggesting that arginine methylation exerts widespread impacts on the biology of these organisms. Here, we performed a global proteomic analysis of Trypanosoma brucei to identify arginine methylated proteins and their sites of modification. Using an approach entailing two-dimensional chromatographic separation and alternating electron transfer dissociation and collision induced dissociation, we identified 1332 methylarginines in 676 proteins. The resulting data set represents the largest compilation of arginine methylated proteins in any organism to date. Functional classification revealed numerous arginine methylated proteins involved in flagellar function, RNA metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and intracellular protein trafficking. Thus, arginine methylation has the potential to impact aspects of T. brucei gene expression, cell biology, and pathogenesis. Interestingly, pathways with known methylated proteins in higher eukaryotes were identified in this study, but often different components of the pathway were methylated in trypanosomes. Methylarginines were often identified in glycine rich contexts, although exceptions to this rule were detected. Collectively, these data inform on a multitude of aspects of trypanosome biology and serve as a guide for the identification of homologous arginine methylated proteins in higher eukaryotes. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: T. brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes lethal African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock, thereby imposing a significant medical and economic burden on sub-Saharan Africa. The parasite encounters very different environments as it cycles between mammalian and insect hosts, and must exert cellular responses to these varying milieus. One mechanism by which all cells respond to changing environments is through posttranslational modification of proteins. Arginine methylation is one such modification that can dramatically impact protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions and subcellular localization of proteins. To define the breadth of arginine methylation in trypanosomes and identify target proteins, we performed a global proteomic analysis of arginine methylated proteins in insect stage T. brucei. We identified 1332 methylarginines in 676 proteins, generating the largest compilation of methylarginine containing proteins in any organism to date. Numerous arginine methylated proteins function in RNA and DNA related processes, suggesting this modification can impact T. brucei genome integrity and gene regulation at numerous points. Other processes that appear to be strongly influenced by arginine methylation are intracellular protein trafficking, signaling, protein folding and degradation, and flagellar function. The widespread nature of arginine methylation in trypanosomes highlights its potential to greatly affect parasite biology and pathogenesis.",3.888,1521

Buccal brushings represent an easily accessible source of DNA, which may be an appropriate surrogate tissue in the study of environmental exposures and chronic respiratory diseases. Buccal brushings were obtained from a subset of current and former smokers from the COPDGene study. Genome-wide DNA methylation data were obtained in the discovery cohort (n = 82) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array. Empirical Bayes methods were used to test for differential methylation by current smoking status at 468,219 autosomal CpG sites using linear models adjusted for age, sex, and race. Pyrosequencing was performed in a nonoverlapping replication cohort (n = 130). Current smokers were significantly younger than former smokers in both the discovery and replication cohorts. Seven CpG sites were associated with current smoking at a false discovery rate less than 0.05 in the discovery cohort. Six of the seven significant sites were pyrosequenced in the replication cohort; five CpG sites, including sites annotated to CYP1B1 and PARVA, were replicated. Correlations between cumulative smoke exposure and time since smoking cessation were observed in a subset of the significantly associated CpG sites. A significant correlation between reduced lung function and increased radiographic emphysema with methylation at cg02162897 (CYP1B1) was observed among female subjects. Site-specific methylation of DNA isolated from buccal mucosa is associated with exposure to cigarette smoke, and may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying differential susceptibility toward the development of smoking-related chronic respiratory diseases.",3.985,380

This behavior makes HPV DNA methylation a useful biomarker of carcinogenic progression of HPV infections. The first step in detecting DNA methylation involves modification by bisulfite, which converts cytosine residues into uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. A combination of this reaction with PCR and DNA sequencing permits to evaluate the methylation status of the sample DNA. This chapter describes the basic protocol to measure HPV-16 and HPV-18 CpG methylation by direct sequencing of the PCR products and discusses the value of modified strategies including DNA cloning, amplification with methylation-specific primers, and real-time PCR with TaqMan probes.",0,1601

Although sodium hydride and alkaline metal hydroxides are commonly employed as bases in these reactions, their poor solubility properties in organic solvents and hydrolytic activities have sometimes limited their application and made the associated (11) C-methylation reactions difficult. In contrast to these bases, tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) is moderately basic, highly soluble in organic solvents, and weakly nucleophilic. Although it was envisaged that TBAF could be used as the preferred base for (11) C-methylation reactions using 1, studies concerning the use of TBAF to promote (11) C-methylation reactions are scarce. Herein, we have evaluated the efficiency of the (11) C-methylation reactions of 13 model compounds using TBAF and 1. In most cases, the N-(11) C-methylations were efficiently promoted by TBAF in dimethyl sulfoxide at ambient temperature, whereas the O-(11) C-methylations required heating in some cases. Comparison studies revealed that the efficiencies of the (11) C-methylation reactions with TBAF were comparable or sometimes greater than those conducted with sodium hydride. Based on these results, TBAF should be considered as the preferred base for (11) C-methylation reactions using 1.",1.273,1353

However, the DNA methylation state of the 45 S rDNA promoter, as well as its effect on rRNA gene expression in types of human cancers is controversial. In the present study we analyzed the methylation status of the rDNA promoter (-380 to +53 bp) as well as associated rRNA expression levels in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor-normal tissue pairs. We found that the aforementioned regulatory region was extensively methylated (74-96%) in all cell lines and in 68% (13/19 tumor-normal pairs) of the tumors. Expression levels of rRNA transcripts 18 S, 28 S, 5.8 S and 45 S external transcribed spacer (45 S ETS) greatly varied in the breast cancer cell lines regardless of their methylation status. Analyses of rRNA transcript expression levels in the breast tumor and normal matched tissues showed no significant difference when normalized with TBP. On the other hand, using the geometric mean of the rRNA expression values (GM-rRNA) as reference enabled us to identify significant changes in the relative expression of rRNAs in the tissue samples. We propose GM-rRNA normalization as a novel strategy to analyze expression differences between rRNA transcripts. Accordingly, the 18S rRNA/GM-rRNA ratio was significantly higher whereas the 5.8S rRNA/GM-rRNA ratio was significantly lower in breast tumor samples than this ratio in the matched normal samples. Moreover, the 18S rRNA/GM-rRNA ratio was negatively correlated with the 45 S rDNA promoter methylation level in the normal breast tissue samples, yet not in the breast tumors. Significant correlations observed between the expression levels of rRNA transcripts in the normal samples were lost in the tumor samples. We showed that the expression of rRNA transcripts may not be based solely on promoter methylation. Carcinogenesis may cause dysregulation of the correlation between spliced rRNA expression levels, possibly due to changes in rRNA processing, which requires further investigation.",2.301,1423

Recent human and animal studies suggest that parental diet can influence fetal development and is implicated with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in offspring. The hypothalamus is central to body energy homoeostasis and appetite by controlling endocrine signals. We hypothesise that offspring susceptibility to obesity is programmed in the hypothalamus in utero and mediated by changes to DNA methylation, which persist to adulthood. We investigated hypothalamic genome-wide DNA methylation in Psammomys obesus diet during pregnancy to the offspring's risk of obesity. METHODS: Using methyl-CpG binding domain capture and deep sequencing (MBD-seq), we examined the hypothalamus of offspring exposed to a low-fat diet and standard chow diet during the gestation and lactation period. RESULTS: Offspring exposed to a low-fat parental diet were more obese and had increased circulating insulin and glucose levels. Methylome profiling identified 1447 genomic regions of differential methylation between offspring of parents fed a low-fat diet compared with parents on standard chow diet. Pathway analysis shows novel DNA methylation changes of hypothalamic genes associated with neurological function, nutrient sensing, appetite and energy balance. Differential DNA methylation corresponded to changes in hypothalamic gene expression of Tas1r1 and Abcc8 in the offspring exposed to low-fat parental diet. CONCLUSION: Subject to parental low-fat diet, we observe DNA methylation changes of genes associated with obesity in offspring.",3.313,1990

RESULTS: Here we report the first genomic analysis of H3K9 di- and tri-methylation on the inactive X: we find they are enriched at the intergenic, gene poor regions of the inactive X, interspersed between H3K27 tri-methylation domains found in the gene dense regions. Although H3K9 methylation is predominantly non-genic, we find that depletion of H3K9 methylation via depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase Set domain bifurcated 1 (Setdb1) during the establishment of X inactivation, results in failure of silencing for around 150 genes on the inactive X. By contrast, we find a very minor role for Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation once X inactivation is fully established. In addition to failed gene silencing, we observed a specific failure to silence X-linked long-terminal repeat class repetitive elements. CONCLUSIONS: Here we have shown that H3K9 methylation clearly marks the murine inactive X chromosome. The role of this mark is most apparent during the establishment phase of gene silencing, with a more muted effect on maintenance of the silent state. Based on our data, we hypothesise that Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation plays a role in epigenetic silencing of the inactive X via silencing of the repeats, which itself facilitates gene silencing through alterations to the conformation of the whole inactive X chromosome.",5.333,1249

 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",2016,"INTRODUCTION: Despite recent advances in cancer therapy, the overall 5-year survival rate of patients with lung cancer remains low. The aim of our study was to search for novel markers for early diagnosis in patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Complementary DNA microarray analysis was performed in primary lung adenocarcinomas and cell lines to search for differentially expressed genes, followed by in vivo and in vitro tumorigenic assays to characterize the oncogenic potential of the candidate genes. Gene body methylation was analyzed by 450K methylation array, bisulfite sequencing, and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data set was also performed. RESULTS: Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A gene (ITPKA), a kinase with limited tissue distribution, was identified as a potential oncogene. We showed that ITPKA expression is up-regulated in many forms of cancers, including lung and breast cancers, and that overexpressed ITPKA contributes to tumorigenesis. We also demonstrated that ITPKA expression is regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation of ITPKA gene body through modulation of the binding of SP1 transcription factor to the ITPKA promoter. ITPKA gene body displayed low or absent levels of methylation in most normal tissue but was significantly methylated in malignant tumors. In lung cancer, ITPKA gene body methylation first appeared at the in situ carcinoma stage and progressively increased after invasion. CONCLUSIONS: ITPKA is a potential oncogene that it is overexpressed in most tumors, and its overexpression promotes tumorigenesis. ITPKA gene body methylation regulates its expression and thus serves as a novel and potential biomarker for early cancer detection.",1.783,718

Mercury methylation and demethylation rates were measured in periphytic biofilms growing on submerged plants in a shallow fluvial lake located in a temperate cold region (St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada). Incubations were performed in situ within macrophyte beds using low-level spikes of (199)HgO and Me(200)Hg stable isotopes as tracers. A direct relationship was observed between Km (0.002 to 0.137 d(-1)) and [MeHg] in periphyton. A similar relationship was found between Kd (0.096 to 0.334 d(-1)) and [inorganic Hg]. Periphyton of Lake St. Pierre reached high levels of net MeHg production that were two orders of magnitude higher than those found in local sediment.

Here we present genome-wide methylation patterns at single-base pair resolution for cassava (Manihot esculenta, cultivar TME 7), a crop with a substantial impact in the agriculture of subtropical and tropical regions. On average, DNA methylation levels were higher in all three DNA sequence contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH, where H equals A, T, or C) than those of the most well-studied model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. As in other plants, DNA methylation was found both on transposons and in the transcribed regions (bodies) of many genes. Consistent with these patterns, at least one cassava gene copy of all of the known components of Arabidopsis DNA methylation pathways was identified. Methylation of LTR transposons (GYPSY and COPIA) was found to be unusually high compared with other types of transposons, suggesting that the control of the activity of these two types of transposons may be especially important. Analysis of duplicated gene pairs resulting from whole-genome duplication showed that gene body DNA methylation and gene expression levels have coevolved over short evolutionary time scales, reinforcing the positive relationship between gene body methylation and high levels of gene expression. Duplicated genes with the most divergent gene body methylation and expression patterns were found to have distinct biological functions and may have been under natural or human selection for cassava traits.",9.674,125

In ecotypes growing in group-1, 44.32 % DNA was methylated and of which 93.59 % DNA was polymorphic. While in group-2, 32.27 % DNA was methylated, of which 51.64 % DNA was polymorphic.

In site 1 and site 2 of group-2, overall methylation was 24.68 and 24.18 % respectively with difference of 0.5 %, while overall polymorphism was 12.19 and 12.65 % with a difference of 0.46 %. The difference of methylation percentage and percentage of methylation polymorphism throughout the genome of J. curcas at site 1 and 2 of group-1 is higher than that of J. curcas at site 1 and 2 of group-2.

Specifically we compared probe-wise DNA methylation variance, and how this variance related to demographic factors across the two tissues. PBMCs had overall higher DNA methylation than BECs, and the two tissues tended to differ most at genomic regions of low CpG density. Furthermore, although both tissues showed appreciable probe-wise variability, the specific regions and magnitude of variability differed strongly between tissues. Lastly, through exploratory association analysis, we found indication of differential association of BEC and PBMC with demographic variables.

Here we demonstrate that HSP90AB1 is methylated by the histone methyltransferase SMYD2 and that it plays a critical role in human carcinogenesis. HSP90AB1 and SMYD2 can interact through the C-terminal region of HSP90AB1 and the SET domain of SMYD2. Both in vitro and in vivo methyltransferase assays revealed that SMYD2 could methylate HSP90AB1 and mass spectrometry analysis indicated lysines 531 and 574 of HSP90AB1 to be methylated. These methylation sites were shown to be important for the dimerization and chaperone complex formation of HSP90AB1. Furthermore, methylated HSP90AB1 accelerated the proliferation of cancer cells.

The adverse effects of arsenic may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, as there are indications that arsenic causes altered DNA methylation of cancer-related genes. The objective was to assess effects of arsenic on genome-wide DNA methylation in newborns. We studied 127 mothers and cord blood of their infants. Arsenic exposure in early and late pregnancy was assessed by concentrations of arsenic metabolites in maternal urine, measured by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Genome-wide 5-methylcytosine methylation in mononuclear cells from cord blood was analyzed by Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Urinary arsenic in early gestation was associated with cord blood DNA methylation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, P-value<10-15), with more pronounced effects in boys than in girls. In boys, 372 (74%) of the 500 top CpG sites showed lower methylation with increasing arsenic exposure (r S -values>-0.62), but in girls only 207 (41%) showed inverse correlation (r S -values>-0.54). Three CpG sites in boys (cg15255455, cg13659051 and cg17646418), but none in girls, were significantly correlated with arsenic after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The associations between arsenic and DNA methylation were robust in multivariable-adjusted linear regression models. Much weaker associations were observed with arsenic exposure in late compared with early gestation. Pathway analysis showed overrepresentation of affected cancer-related genes in boys, but not in girls. In conclusion, early prenatal arsenic exposure appears to decrease DNA methylation in boys. Associations between early exposure and DNA methylation might reflect interference with de novo DNA methylation.",0.75,1997

Thus, we aimed at establishing a high-performance noninvasive DNA methylation assay based on pyrosequencing for screening of prostate cancer in this article. The assay is designed to detect aberrant promoter methylation of RARbeta2 gene in ejaculate samples. The negative and positive control plasmids were constructed with different treatments by direct bisulfite conversion or conversion after Sss I Methylase methylation to establish quality control standard. The ejaculate and tissue samples were collected from patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of prostate (n = 43) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 40). Significant correlation was observed between prostate cancer and methylation level of RARbeta2 gene promoter. In addition, the results of pyrosequencing in ejaculate samples were compared with that of DNA sequencing in tissue samples from the same patients. There is no significant difference in the detection of RARbeta2 promotor methylation between these two methods (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we have developed a high-performance noninvasive DNA methylation assay based on pyrosequencing which is more suitable for high-throughput detection of aberrant promoter methylation in ejaculate samples. Moreover, the acceptive degree of this noninvasive method makes it potentially promising for future screening of prostate cancer.",1.68,888
25953647,Flow-Dependent Epigenetic DNA Methylation in Endothelial Gene Expression and Atherosclerosis.,"['Dunn J', 'Thabet S', 'Jo H']","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2015,"Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate endothelial cell gene expression are now emerging. DNA methylation is the most stable epigenetic mark that confers persisting changes in gene expression. Not only is DNA methylation important in rendering cell identity by regulating cell type-specific gene expression throughout differentiation, but it is becoming clear that DNA methylation also plays a key role in maintaining endothelial cell homeostasis and in vascular disease development. Disturbed blood flow causes atherosclerosis, whereas stable flow protects against it by differentially regulating gene expression in endothelial cells. Recently, we and others have shown that flow-dependent gene expression and atherosclerosis development are regulated by mechanisms dependent on DNA methyltransferases (1 and 3A). Disturbed blood flow upregulates DNA methyltransferase expression both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to genome-wide DNA methylation alterations and global gene expression changes in a DNA methyltransferase-dependent manner. These studies revealed several mechanosensitive genes, such as HoxA5, Klf3, and Klf4, whose promoters were hypermethylated by disturbed blood flow, but rescued by DNA methyltransferases inhibitors such as 5Aza-2-deoxycytidine. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which flow controls epigenomic DNA methylation patterns, which in turn alters endothelial gene expression, regulates vascular biology, and modulates atherosclerosis development.",6.0,453

Maintenance DNA methylation in plants occurs at symmetrical (m)CG and (m)CHG contexts ((m) = methylated) and is maintained by DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) DNA methyltransferase protein families, respectively. While angiosperm genomes encode for several members of MET1 and CMT families, the moss Physcomitrella patens, serving as a model for early divergent land plants, carries a single member of each family. To determine the function of P. patens PpMET we generated DeltaPpmet deletion mutant which lost (m)CG and unexpectedly (m)CCG methylation at loci tested. In order to evaluate the extent of (m)CCG methylation by MET1, we reexamined the Arabidopsis thaliana Atmet1 mutant methylome and found a similar pattern of methylation loss, suggesting that maintenance of DNA methylation by MET1 is conserved through land plant evolution. While DeltaPpmet displayed no phenotypic alterations during its gametophytic phase, it failed to develop sporophytes, indicating that PpMET plays a role in gametogenesis or early sporophyte development. Expression array analysis revealed that the deletion of PpMET resulted in upregulation of two genes and multiple repetitive sequences. In parallel, expression analysis of the previously reported DeltaPpcmt mutant showed that lack of PpCMT triggers overexpression of genes. This overexpression combined with loss of (m)CHG and its pleiotropic phenotype, implies that PpCMT has an essential evolutionary conserved role in the epigenetic control of gene expression. Collectively, our results suggest functional conservation of MET1 and CMT families during land plant evolution. A model describing the relationship between MET1 and CMT in CCG methylation is presented.",4.257,448

 Society for Neuroscience",2016,"The endogenous NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist D-aspartate occurs transiently in the mammalian brain because it is abundant during embryonic and perinatal phases before drastically decreasing during adulthood. It is well established that postnatal reduction of cerebral D-aspartate levels is due to the concomitant onset of D-aspartate oxidase (DDO) activity, a flavoenzyme that selectively degrades bicarboxylic D-amino acids. In the present work, we show that d-aspartate content in the mouse brain drastically decreases after birth, whereas Ddo mRNA levels concomitantly increase. Interestingly, postnatal Ddo gene expression is paralleled by progressive demethylation within its putative promoter region. Consistent with an epigenetic control on Ddo expression, treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent, azacitidine, causes increased mRNA levels in embryonic cortical neurons. To indirectly evaluate the effect of a putative persistent Ddo gene hypermethylation in the brain, we used Ddo knock-out mice (Ddo(-/-)), which show constitutively suppressed Ddo expression. In these mice, we found for the first time substantially increased extracellular content of d-aspartate in the brain. In line with detrimental effects produced by NMDAR overstimulation, persistent elevation of D-aspartate levels in Ddo(-/-) brains is associated with appearance of dystrophic microglia, precocious caspase-3 activation, and cell death in cortical pyramidal neurons and dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. This evidence, along with the early accumulation of lipufuscin granules in Ddo(-/-) brains, highlights an unexpected importance of Ddo demethylation in preventing neurodegenerative processes produced by nonphysiological extracellular levels of free D-aspartate.",0,493

We analyzed the DNA methylation of  approximately 480 000 sites in human adipose tissue from 96 males and 94 females and related methylation to age, BMI and HbA1c. We also compared epigenetic signatures in adipose tissue and blood. Age was significantly associated with both altered DNA methylation and expression of 1050 genes (e.g. FHL2, NOX4 and PLG). Interestingly, many reported epigenetic biomarkers of aging in blood, including ELOVL2, FHL2, KLF14 and GLRA1, also showed significant correlations between adipose tissue DNA methylation and age in our study. The most significant association between age and adipose tissue DNA methylation was found upstream of ELOVL2. We identified 2825 genes (e.g. FTO, ITIH5, CCL18, MTCH2, IRS1 and SPP1) where both DNA methylation and expression correlated with BMI. Methylation at previously reported HIF3A sites correlated significantly with BMI in females only. HbA1c (range 28-46 mmol/mol) correlated significantly with the methylation of 711 sites, annotated to, for example, RAB37, TICAM1 and HLA-DPB1. Pathway analyses demonstrated that methylation levels associated with age and BMI are overrepresented among genes involved in cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our results highlight the impact of age, BMI and HbA1c on epigenetic variation of candidate genes for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer in human adipose tissue.

In the coding genes, 64.5% of the methylated reads mapped to the gene body region; by contrast, 60.7% of methylated reads in miRNA genes mainly mapped in the 5' and 3' flanking regions. CHH methylation showed the highest methylation levels and CHG showed the lowest methylation levels. Correlation analysis showed a significant, negative, strand-specific correlation of methylation and miRNA gene expression (r=0.79, P <0.05).

Illumina's 450K Infinium arrays were applied to 47 MBC and 188 FBC tumors. Unsupervised clustering of the most variable CpGs among MBC tumors revealed two stable epitypes, designated ME1 and ME2. The methylation patterns differed significantly between the groups and were closely associated with the transcriptional subgroups luminal M1 and M2. Tumors in the ME1 group were more proliferative and aggressive than ME2 tumors, and showed a tendency toward inferior survival. ME1 tumors also displayed hypermethylation of PRC2 target genes and high expression of EZH2, one of the core components of PRC2. Upon combined analysis of MBC and FBC tumors, ME1 MBCs clustered among luminal B FBC tumors and ME2 MBCs clustered within the predominantly luminal A FBC cluster. The majority of the MBC tumors remained grouped together within the clusters rather than being interspersed among the FBC tumors. Differences in the genomic location of methylated CpGs, as well as in the regulation of central canonical pathways may explain the separation between MBC and FBC tumors in the respective clusters.

This study investigated whether human ESR1 has a T-DMR and whether DNA methylation of the T-DMR regulates its expression. ESR1 expression was tissue-specific, being high in the endometrium and mammary gland and low/nil in the placenta and skin. Therefore, DNA methylation profiles of the promoter of ESR1 were analyzed in these tissues and in breast cancer tissues. In all of the normal tissues, the proximal promoter regions were unmethylated. On the other hand, the distal regions (T-DMR) were unmethylated in the endometrium and mammary gland, but were moderately methylated and hypermethylated in the placenta and skin, respectively. T-DMR-methylated reporter assay was performed to examine whether DNA methylation at the T-DMR suppresses ESR1 transcription. T-DMR, but not the promoter region, had transcriptional activities and DNA methylation of the T-DMR suppressed ESR1 transcription. Early growth response protein 1 was shown to be a possible transcription factor to bind the T-DMR and up-regulate ESR1 expression. ESR1 has several upstream exons, and each upstream exon, Exon-A/Exon-B/Exon-C, had its own T-DMR. In some breast cancer cases and breast cancer cell lines, ESR1 expression was not regulated by DNA methylation at T-DMR as it is in normal tissues. In conclusion, ESR1 has a T-DMR.

Pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of differential methylation at genes related to muscle contraction and cardiomyopathies in the developing heart DNA. We have also searched for abnormal methylation profiles on developing heart-tissue DNA of syndromic and non-syndromic congenital heart defects. On average, 3 regions with aberrant methylation were detected per sample and 18 regions were found differentially methylated between groups. Several epimutations were detected in candidate genes involved in growth regulation, apoptosis and folate pathway. A likely pathogenic hypermethylation of several intragenic sites at the MSX1 gene, involved in outflow tract morphogenesis, was found in a fetus with isolated heart malformation. In addition, hypermethylation of the GATA4 gene was present in fetuses with Down syndrome with or without congenital heart defects, as well as in fetuses with isolated heart malformations. Expression deregulation of the abnormally methylated genes was detected. Our data indicate that epigenetic alterations of relevant genes are present in developing heart DNA in fetuses with both isolated and syndromic heart malformations.

When phosphate concentrations are very low in the marine environment, the mol:mol availability of phosphate relative to the chemically similar arsenate molecule is reduced, potentially resulting in increased cellular arsenic exposure. To mediate accidental arsenate uptake, some Prochlorococcus isolates contain genes encoding a full or partial efflux detoxification pathway, consisting of an arsenate reductase (arsC), an arsenite-specific efflux pump (acr3) and an arsenic-related repressive regulator (arsR). This efflux pathway was the only previously known arsenic detox pathway in Prochlorococcus. We have identified an additional putative arsenic mediation strategy in Prochlorococcus driven by the enzyme arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) which can convert inorganic arsenic into more innocuous organic forms and appears to be a more widespread mode of detoxification. We used a phylogenetically informed approach to identify Prochlorococcus linked arsenic genes from both pathways in the Global Ocean Sampling survey. The putative arsenic methylation pathway is nearly ubiquitously present in global Prochlorococcus populations. In contrast, the complete efflux pathway is only maintained in populations which experience extremely low PO4:AsO4, such as regions in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic. Thus, environmental exposure to arsenic appears to select for maintenance of the efflux detoxification pathway in Prochlorococcus. The differential distribution of these two pathways has implications for global arsenic cycling, as their associated end products, arsenite or organoarsenicals, have differing biochemical activities and residence times.",0,1095

Current classification of PHP patients is hampered by clinical and molecular diagnostic overlaps. The European Consortium for the study of PHP designed a genome-wide methylation study to improve molecular diagnosis. METHODS: The HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip was used to analyze genome-wide methylation in 24 PHP patients with parathyroid hormone resistance and 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients were previously diagnosed with GNAS-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and include 6 patients with known STX16 deletion (PHP(Deltastx16)) and 18 without deletion (PHP(neg)). RESULTS: The array demonstrated that PHP patients do not show DNA methylation differences at the whole-genome level. Unsupervised clustering of GNAS-specific DMRs divides PHP(Deltastx16) versus PHP(neg) patients. Interestingly, in contrast to the notion that all PHP patients share methylation defects in the A/B DMR while only PHP(Deltastx16) patients have normal NESP, GNAS-AS1 and XL methylation, we found a novel DMR (named GNAS-AS2) in the GNAS-AS1 region that is significantly different in both PHP(Deltastx16) and PHP(neg), as validated by Sequenom EpiTYPER in a larger PHP cohort. The analysis of 58 DMRs revealed that 8/18 PHP(neg) and 1/6 PHP(Deltastx16) patients have multi-locus methylation defects. Validation was performed for FANCC and SVOPL DMRs.

Associations of F2RL3 methylation and smoking with lung cancer incidence/mortality during a median follow-up of 10.9 years were assessed by Cox regression, controlling for potential confounders. The ability of F2RL3 methylation to predict lung cancer was examined by Harrell's C statistics.

Although these environmentally related effects have been attributed to epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation shifts at imprinted genes, little is known about the potential effects of maternal and paternal preconceptional overnutrition or obesity. OBJECTIVE: We examined parental preconceptional obesity in relation to DNA methylation profiles at multiple human imprinted genes important in normal growth and development, such as: maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG3), pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 (PLAGL1), epsilon sarcoglycan and paternally expressed gene 10 (SGCE/PEG10) and neuronatin (NNAT). METHODS: We measured methylation percentages at the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by bisulfite pyrosequencing in DNA extracted from umbilical cord blood leukocytes of 92 newborns. Preconceptional obesity, defined as BMI 30 kg m(-2), was ascertained through standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders and cluster effects, paternal obesity was significantly associated with lower methylation levels at the MEST (beta=-2.57; s.e.=0.95; P=0.008), PEG3 (beta=-1.71; s.e.=0.61; P=0.005) and NNAT (beta=-3.59; s.e.=1.76; P=0.04) DMRs. Changes related to maternal obesity detected at other loci were as follows: beta-coefficient was +2.58 (s.e.=1.00; P=0.01) at the PLAGL1 DMR and -3.42 (s.e.=1.69; P=0.04) at the MEG3 DMR. CONCLUSION: We found altered methylation outcomes at multiple imprint regulatory regions in children born to obese parents, compared with children born to non-obese parents. In spite of the small sample size, our data suggest a preconceptional influence of parental life-style or overnutrition on the (re)programming of imprint marks during gametogenesis and early development. More specifically, the significant and independent association between paternal obesity and the offspring's methylation status suggests the susceptibility of the developing sperm for environmental insults. The acquired imprint instability may be carried onto the next generation and increase the risk for chronic diseases in adulthood.",3.313,1129

Next-generation sequencing has been used to characterize DNA methylation status at the genome scale, but suffers from high sequencing cost in the case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or from reduced resolution (inability to precisely define which of the CpGs are methylated) with capture-based techniques. RESULTS: Here we present a computational method that computes nucleotide-resolution methylation values from capture-based data by incorporating fragment length profiles into a model of methylation analysis. We demonstrate that it compares favorably with nucleotide-resolution bisulfite sequencing and has better predictive power with respect to a reference than window-based methods, often used for enrichment data. The described method was used to produce the methylation data used in tandem with gene expression to produce a novel and clinically significant gene signature in acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, we introduce a complementary statistical method that uses this nucleotide-resolution methylation data for detection of differentially methylated features.",0,1795

While nutrients involved in one-carbon cycle metabolism are important to fetal growth, associations with specific nutrients remain inconsistent. This study estimates associations between maternal vitamins B12, B6 (pyridoxal phosphate [PLP] and 4-pyridoxic acid [PA]), and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations, offspring weight (birth weight and 3-year weight gain), and DNA methylation at four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) known to be involved in fetal growth and development (H19, MEG3, SGCE/PEG10, and PLAGL1). METHODS: Study participants (n = 496) with biomarker and birth weight data were enrolled as part of the Newborn Epigenetics STudy. Weight gain data were available for 273 offspring. Among 484 mother-infant pairs, DNA methylation at regulatory sequences of genomically imprinted genes was measured in umbilical cord blood DNA using bisulfite pyrosequencing. We used generalized linear models to estimate associations. RESULTS: Multivariate adjusted regression models revealed an inverse association between maternal Hcy concentration and male birth weight (beta = -210.40, standard error (SE) = 102.08, p = 0.04). The offspring of the mothers in the highest quartile of B12 experienced lower weight gain between birth and 3 years compared to the offspring of the mothers in the lowest (beta = -2203.03, SE = 722.49, p = 0.003). Conversely, maternal PLP was associated with higher weight gain in males; higher maternal PLP concentrations were also associated with offspring DNA methylation levels at the MEG3 DMR (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: While maternal concentrations of B12, B6, and Hcy do not associate with birth weight overall, they may play an important role in 3-year weight gain. This is the first study to report an association between maternal PLP and methylation at the MEG3 DMR which may be an important epigenetic tag for maternal B vitamin adequacy.",4.543,312

Because methylation can occur on nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur centers and multiple methylation states exist on the nitrogen centers, methylproteome remains poorly documented. Here we present the methylation by isotope labeled SAM (MILS) strategy for a highly-confident analysis of the methylproteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the online multidimensional muHPLC/MS/MS technology. We identified 43 methylated proteins, containing 68 methylation events associated with 64 methylation sites. More than 90% of these methylation events were previously unannotated in Uniprot database. Our results indicated, 1) over 2.6% of identified S. cerevisiae proteins are methylated, 2) the amino acid residue preference of protein methylation follows the order Lys>>Arg>Asp>Asn approximately Gln approximately His>Glu>Cys, and 3) the methylation state on nitrogen center is largely exclusive. As our dataset covers various types of methylation centers, it provides rich information about yeast methylproteome and should significantly contribute to the field of protein methylation. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this paper, we presented the methylation by isotope labeled SAM (MILS) strategy for a highly-confident analysis of the methylproteome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and collected a comprehensive list of proteins methylated on a set of distinct residues (K, R, N, E, D, Q, H, C).

Here, we further explore the mechanism of MSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes from the perspective of interactions between epigenetic modifications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used lentiviral vectors to overexpress Islet-1 in MSCs, and ChIP-qPCR, MSP and BSP were performed to detect levels of histone acetylation/methylation and DNA methylation in the GATA4 and Nkx2.5 promoters. To further explore relationships between these epigenetic modifications, we used 5-aza or TSA to interfere with DNA methylation and histone acetylation, respectively, and detected effects on the other two modifications. RESULTS: Histone acetylation level increased and its methylation level decreased at GATA4 and Nkx2.5 promoters; DNA methylation level was reduced at the GATA4 promoter but did not change at the Nkx2.5 promoter. Furthermore, 5-aza increased histone acetylation level and reduced its methylation level at the GATA4 promoter but had no effect on the Nkx2.5 promoter; TSA reduced histone methylation and DNA methylation levels at the GATA4 promoter, but it only reduced histone methylation level at the Nkx2.5 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Histone acetylation/methylation and DNA methylation were both involved in regulating GATA4 expression, but Nkx2.5 expression was not regulated by DNA methylation. These three modifications had high correlation with each other during regulation of GATA4 and produced a regulation loop at the GATA4 promoter.",3.116,1038

The H haplogroup is protective against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), while the J haplogroup is high risk for AMD. In the present study, we performed comparison analyses of human retinal cell cybrids, which possess identical nuclei, but mtDNA from subjects with either the H or J haplogroups, and demonstrate differences in total global methylation, and expression patterns for two genes related to acetylation and five genes related to methylation. Analyses revealed that untreated-H and -J cybrids have different expression levels for nuclear genes (CFH, EFEMP1, VEGFA and NFkB2). However, expression levels for these genes become equivalent after treatment with a methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, sequencing of the entire mtDNA suggests that differences in epigenetic status found in cybrids are likely due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the haplogroup profiles rather than rare variants or private SNPs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that mtDNA variants can mediate methylation profiles and transcription for inflammation, angiogenesis and various signaling pathways, which are important in several common diseases.",6.393,1784

Greenland Inuits are characterized by the highest worldwide POP levels. In this cross-sectional study we evaluated the relationship between serum POP concentrations and DNA methylation levels in sperm of non-occupationally exposed fertile men from Greenland, Warsaw (Poland), and Kharkiv (Ukraine). Serum levels of PCB-153 [1,2,4-trichloro-5-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)benzene], as a proxy of the total PCBs body burden, and of p,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene], the main metabolite of DDT were measured. Sperm DNA methylation level was assessed globally by flow cytometric (FCM) immunodetection of 5-methyl-cytosines and at specific repetitive DNA sequences (Alu, LINE-1, Satalpha) by PCR-pyrosequencing after bisulfite conversion. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to investigate correlations between serum POP concentrations and DNA methylation. No consistent associations between exposure to POPs and sperm DNA methylation at repetitive DNA sequences were detected. A statistically significant global decrease in methylation was associated with exposure to either POP by FCM analysis. This is the first study to investigate environmental exposure to POPs and DNA methylation levels considering sperm as the target cells. Although POP exposure appears to have a limited negative impact on sperm DNA methylation levels in adult males, the global hypomethylation detected by one of the methods applied suggests that further investigation is warranted.",2.63,88

Although HPV testing of self-collected vaginal samples is acceptable, the specificity is inadequate. The current focus is increasing self-collection of vaginal samples to minimize clinic visits. In this study, we analyzed the concordance and clinical performance of DNA methylation biomarker (PAX1, SOX1, and ZNF582) detection in self-collected vaginal samples and physician-collected cervical samples for the identification of cervical neoplasm. METHODS: We enrolled 136 cases with paired methylation data identified from abnormal Pap smears (n = 126) and normal controls (n = 10) regardless of HPV status at gynecological clinics. The study group comprised 37 cervical intraepithelial neoplasm I (CIN1), 23 cervical intraepithelial neoplasm II (CIN2), 16 cervical intraepithelial neoplasm III (CIN3), 30 carcinoma in situ (CIS), 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and seven adenocarcinomas (ACs)/adenosquamous carcinomas (ASCs). PAX1, SOX1 and ZNF582 methylation in study samples was assessed by real-time quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. We generated methylation index cutoff values for the detection of CIN3+ in physician-collected cervical samples for analysis of the self-collected group. Concordance between the physician-collected and self-collected groups was evaluated by Cohen's Kappa. Sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) were calculated for detection of CIN3+ lesions. Finally, we produced an optimal cutoff value with the best sensitivity from the self-collected groups. RESULTS: We generated a methylation index cutoff value from physician-collected samples for detection of CIN3+. There were no significant differences in sensitivity, specificity of PAX1, SOX1 and ZNF582 between the self-collected and physician-collected groups. The methylation status of all three genes in the normal control samples, and the CIN 1, CIN2, CIN3, CIS, ACs/ASCs and SCC samples showed reasonable to good concordance between the two groups (kappa = 0.443, 0.427, and 0.609 for PAX1, SOX1, and ZNF582, respectively). In determining the optimal cutoff values from the self-collected group, ZNF582 showed the highest sensitivity (0.77; 95%CI, 0.65-0.87) using a cutoff value of 0.0204. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation biomarker analysis of the three genes for detection of CIN3+ lesions shows reasonable to good concordance between the self-collected and physician-collected samples.

CPM 4, 20, 100 mg/kg bw/day was administered to 4 pregnant mice per group between 7 and 12 days post coitum (d.p.c.). Pregnant mice were killed at 13 d.p.c. The genomic methylation in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and fetal organs (the liver, intestine, and placenta) was examined. Four polymorphism sites in the H19 alleles of maternal (C57BL/6J) and paternal (CAST/Ei) alleles were identified at nucleotide position 1407, 1485, 1566, and 1654. The methylation patterns of 17 CpG sites were analyzed. The methylation level in male and female PGCs was not altered by CPM treatment in the maternal allele H19. The methylation level of the paternal H19 allele was altered in only male PGCs in response to the CPM treatment. The methylation level at a binding site for the transcriptional regulator CTCF2 was higher than that at the CTCF1 binding site in all CPM-treated groups. In the placenta, the aggregate methylation level of H19 was 56.89%in control group. But, those levels were ranged from 47.7% to 49.89% after treatment with increasing doses of CPM. H19 gene from the liver and intestine of 13 d.p.c. fetuses treated with CPM was hypomethylated as compared with controls, although H19 mRNA expression was unaltered. In the placenta, H19 expression was slightly increased in the CPM-treated group, although not significantly. IGF2 expression levels were not significantly changed in the placenta. In conclusion, CPM exposure during pregnancy alters the methylation status of the H19 gene in PGCs and embryonic tissues. We infer that these alterations are likely related to changes in DNA demethylase activity.",3.197,247

Many studies have mapped DNA methylation changes associated with embryogenesis, cell differentiation, and cancer at a genome-wide scale. Our understanding of genome-wide DNA methylation changes in a developmental or disease-related context has been steadily growing. However, the investigation of which CpGs are variably methylated in different normal cell or tissue types is still limited. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of 54 single-CpG-resolution DNA methylomes of normal human cell types by integrating high-throughput sequencing-based methylation data. We found that the ratio of methylated to unmethylated CpGs is relatively constant regardless of cell type. However, which CpGs made up the unmethylated complement was cell-type specific. We categorized the 26,000,000 human autosomal CpGs based on their methylation levels across multiple cell types to identify variably methylated CpGs and found that 22.6% exhibited variable DNA methylation. These variably methylated CpGs formed 660,000 variably methylated regions (VMRs), encompassing 11% of the genome. By integrating a multitude of genomic data, we found that VMRs enrich for histone modifications indicative of enhancers, suggesting their role as regulatory elements marking cell type specificity. VMRs enriched for transcription factor binding sites in a tissue-dependent manner. Importantly, they enriched for GWAS variants, suggesting that VMRs could potentially be implicated in disease and complex traits. Taken together, our results highlight the link between CpG methylation variation, genetic variation, and disease risk for many human cell types.",0,870

Results The p16 protein expression in breast cancer samples significantly lower when compared with those of hyperplasia samples (48. 9% vs. 70. 0%) and p16 methylation was more frequent in breast-tumor tissues when compared with those of hyperplasia samples (38. 3% vs. 20. 0%), but the statistical significance wasn't found (P> 0. 05). Down-regulation of p16 protein was negatively correlation with p16 gene hypermethylation (r= -0. 33, P =0. 02). Meanwhile, p16 methylation in breast cancer tissues correlated with histological type, lymph node metastasis, but not correlated with the age, tumor diameter, TNM stage, expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) gene status.

Although some key transcription factors are known, the epigenetic mechanisms modulating TGFBIp and ECM expression remain unclear. We examined the role of chromatin markers such as histone H3 lysine methylation (H3Kme) in TGFbeta1-induced TGFBIp and ECM gene expression in normal and GCD2-derived human corneal fibroblasts. METHODS: Wild-type (n = 3), GCD2-heterozygous (n = 1), and GCD2-homozygous (n = 3) primary human corneal fibroblasts were harvested from human donors and patients prepared. Microarray and gene-expression profiling, Chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray analysis, and Methylated DNA isolation assay-assisted CpG microarrays was performed in Wild-type and GCD2-homozygous human cells. RESULTS: Transcription and extracellular-secretion levels of TGFBIp were high in normal cells compared with those in GCD2-derived cells and were related to H3K4me3 levels but not to DNA methylation over the TGFBI locus. TGFbeta1 increased the expression of TGFBIp and the ECM-associated genes connective tissue growth factor, collagen-alpha2[Iota], and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in normal corneal fibroblasts. Increased levels of gene-activating markers (H3K4me1/3) and decreased levels of repressive markers (H3K27me3) at the promoters of those gene accompanied the changes in expression. TGFbeta1 also increased recruitment of the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 and of SET7/9 and also the binding of Smad3 to the promoters. Knockdown of both MLL1 and SET7/9 significantly blocked the TGFbeta1-induced gene expression and inhibited TGFbeta1-induced changes in promoter H3K4me1/3 levels. Those effects were very weak, however, in GCD2-derived corneal fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results show the functional role of H3K4me in TGFbeta1-mediated TGFBIp and ECM gene expression in corneal fibroblasts.

Its aetiology and underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Underlying epigenetic changes of imprinted genes have emerged as a potential pathological pathway because they may be associated with growth, including SGA. As a common methyl donor, folic acid (FA) is essential for DNA methylation, synthesis and repair, and FA supplementation is widely recommended for women planning pregnancy. The present study aimed to investigate the inter-relationships among methylation levels of two imprinted genes [H19 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and MEST DMRs], maternal FA supplementation and SGA. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. Umbilical cord blood was taken from 39 SGA infants and 49 controls whose birth weights are appropriate for gestational age (AGA). DNA methylation levels of H19 and MEST DMRs were determined by an analysis of mass array quantitative methylation. RESULTS: Statistically significantly higher methylation levels were observed at sites 7.8, 9 and 17.18 of H19 (P = 0.030, 0.016 and 0.050, respectively) in the SGA infants compared to the AGA group. In addition, the association was stronger in male births where the mothers took FA around conception at six H19 sites (P = 0.004, 0.005, 0.048, 0.002, 0.021 and 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation levels at H19 DMRs were higher in SGA infants compared to AGA controls.

Mice exposed to DBPs showed global DNA hypomethylation and c-myc and c-jun gene-specific hypomethylation, while evidence of epigenetic effects in humans is scarce. We explored the association between lifetime THM exposure and DNA methylation through an epigenome-wide association study. We selected 138 population-based controls from a case-control study of colorectal cancer conducted in Barcelona, Spain, exposed to average lifetime THM levels </=85 mug/L vs. >85 mug/L (N = 68 and N = 70, respectively). Mean age of participants was 70 years, and 54% were male. Average lifetime THM level in the exposure groups was 64 and 130 microg/L, respectively. DNA was extracted from whole blood and was bisulphite converted to measure DNA methylation levels using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Data preprocessing was performed using RnBeads. Methylation was compared between exposure groups using empirical Bayes moderated linear regression for CpG sites and Gaussian kernel for CpG regions. ConsensusPathDB was used for gene set enrichment. Statistically significant differences in methylation between exposure groups was found in 140 CpG sites and 30 gene-related regions, after false discovery rate <0.05 and adjustment for age, sex, methylation first principal component, and blood cell proportion. The annotated genes were localized to several cancer pathways. Among them, 29 CpGs had methylation levels associated with THM levels (|Deltabeta|>/=0.05) located in 11 genes associated with cancer in other studies. Our results suggest that THM exposure may affect DNA methylation in genes related to tumors, including colorectal and bladder cancers. Future confirmation studies are required.",4.78,827

 Oncology",2016,"PURPOSE: We conducted this meta-analysis of published case-control studies aiming to evaluate the relationship between abnormal suppression of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) promoter methylation and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and China Biological Medicine (CBM) databases without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. We calculated odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (95% CI) to estimate the correlations. RESULTS: Sixteen case-control studies with a total of 941 HCC patients and 114 individuals with benign liver diseases met our inclusion criteria. Our results demonstrated that the frequency of SOCS-1 promoter methylation in cancer tissues was significantly higher than in adjacent non-tumorous tissues and benign tissues (cancer tissue vs adjacent tissue: OR=3.05, 95%CI 1.62-5.77, p=0.001; cancer tissue vs benign tissue: OR=11.55, 95%CI 5.93-22.49, p=0.000). Subgroup analyses by ethnicity, detecting method and sample size also suggested that abnormal SOCS-1 promoter methylation was correlated to the risk of HCC in the majority of these subgroups. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide empirical evidence that abnormal SOCS-1 promoter methylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC. Thus, detection of SOCS-1 promoter methylation may be a valuable diagnostic biomarker for HCC.",0,478

As the master regulator of Treg cells, FOXP3 controls development and suppressive function. Stable Treg-cell FOXP3 expression is epigenetically regulated; constitutive expression requires a demethylated Treg-specific demethylated region. Here, we hypothesised that methylation of the FOXP3 locus is altered in Treg cells of established RA patients. Methylation analysis of key regulatory regions in the FOXP3 locus was performed on Treg cells from RA patients and healthy controls. The FOXP3 Treg-specific demethylated region and proximal promoter displayed comparable methylation profiles in RA and healthy-donor Treg cells. We identified a novel differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of the FOXP3 promoter, with enhancer activity sensitive to methylation-induced silencing. In RA Treg cells we observed significantly reduced DMR methylation and lower DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1/3A) expression compared with healthy Treg cells. Furthermore, DMR methylation negatively correlated with FOXP3 mRNA expression, and Treg cells isolated from rheumatoid factor negative RA patients were found to express significantly higher levels of FOXP3 than Treg cells from RhF-positive patients, with an associated decrease in DMR methylation. In conclusion, the novel DMR is involved in the regulation of Treg-cell FOXP3 expression, but this regulation is lost post-transcriptionally in RA Treg cells.",4.034,1336

 Pan American Society for Clinical Virology",2014,"BACKGROUND: HPV16 is the most prevalent genotype in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs), but there are few information about intratype variants prevalence and their clinical relevance in these tumors. Moreover, since HPV DNA detection alone is not sufficient to determine a favorable prognosis for OPSCCs, additional diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers are necessary. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of HPV intratype variants and evaluate the role of HPV16 DNA methylation as prognostic marker in OPSCCs. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 81 biopsies of OPSCCs for HPV detection and genotyping with a pyrosequencing-based HPV DNA-test. We also quantified viral DNA methylation frequency in the LCR by pyrosequencing in patients with transcriptionally-active HPV16-infection, analyzing it in function of available clinical/virological data. RESULTS: The overall HPV prevalence was 74.1% and HPV16 was confirmed the most prevalent genotype (51/60, 85.0%). Interestingly, we detected, for the first time, HPV16 African variants in 10/51 cases (19.6%), pointing out their clinical relevance also out of the anogenital district. Regarding viral DNA methylation, the E2BS1 showed a significantly higher mean methylation frequency compared to E2BS3/4, as previously observed in high-grade precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. On the other hand, patient with a mean methylation frequency in the early promoter >10% showed only a tendency to have a worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight both the involvement of HPV16 African variants in OPSCCs development and the necessity of further studies to deepen the role of viral methylation in these tumors, in order to better define similarities/differences compared to cervical cancer.",1.212,1806

There are recent studies indicating that Krebs cycle intermediates can shape the epigenetic landscape of chromatin by regulating DNA and histone methylation. A growing evidence indicates that epigenetics plays an important role in the regulation of healthspan but also is involved in the aging process. 2-Oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) is a key metabolite in the Krebs cycle but it is also an obligatory substrate for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDO). The 2-OGDO enzyme family includes the major enzymes of DNA and histone demethylation, i.e. Ten-Eleven Translocation (TETs) and Jumonji C domain containing (JmjC) demethylases. In addition, 2-OGDO members can regulate collagen synthesis and hypoxic responses in a non-epigenetical manner. Interestingly, succinate and fumarate, also Krebs cycle intermediates, are potent inhibitors of 2-OGDO enzymes, i.e. the balance of Krebs cycle reactions can affect the level of DNA and histone methylation and thus control gene expression. We will review the epigenetic mechanisms through which Krebs cycle intermediates control the DNA and histone methylation. We propose that age-related disturbances in the Krebs cycle function induce stochastic epigenetic changes in chromatin structures which in turn promote the aging process.",4.94,744

We investigated the effects of asthma-associated SNPs on DNA methylation and mRNA levels of GSDMB and ORMDL3. Genetic association between GSDMB/ORMDL3 and physician-diagnosed childhood asthma was confirmed in the Swedish birth-cohort BAMSE. CpG-site SNPs (rs7216389 and rs4065275) showed differences in DNA methylation depending on carrier status of the risk alleles, and were significantly associated with methylation levels in two CpG sites in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of ORMDL3. In the Swedish Search study, we found significant differences in DNA methylation between asthmatics and controls in five CpG sites; after adjusting for lymphocyte and neutrophil cell counts, three remained significant: one in IKZF3 [IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos); cg16293631] and two in the CpG island (CGI) of ORMDL3 (cg02305874 and cg16638648). Also, cg16293631 and cg02305874 correlated with mRNA levels of ORMDL3. The association between methylation and asthma was independent of the genotype in rs7216389, rs4065275 and rs12603332. Both SNPs and CpG sites showed significant associations with ORMDL3 mRNA levels. SNPs influenced expression independently of methylation, and the residual association between methylation and expression was not mediated by these SNPs. We found a differentially methylated region in the CGI shore of ORMDL3 with six CpG sites less methylated in CD8(+) T-cells. In summary, this study supports that there are differences in DNA methylation at this locus between asthmatics and controls; and both SNPs and CpG sites are independently associated with ORMDL3 expression.",6.393,1049

Here, we characterized the methylation status of the Piwil1 promoter in five different spermatogenic cell lines using direct bisulfite pyrosequencing and determined that methylation correlates negatively with germ cell type-specific expression patterns of piwil1. We demonstrated that methylation of the -148 CpG site, which is the predicted binding site for the transcription factors TCF3 and NRF1, was differentially methylated in different spermatogenic cells. This site was completely methylated in PGCs (primordial germ cells), but was unmethylated in round spermatids. A similar result was obtained in the region from +121 to +139 CpG sites of the Piwil1 promoter CpG island, which was predicted to contain SOX2 binding sites. In addition, demethylation assays further demonstrated that DNA methylation indeed regulates Piwil1 expression during chicken spermatogenesis. Combined with transcription factor binding site prediction, we speculate that methylation influences the recruitment of corresponding transcription factors. Collectively, we show the negative correlation between promoter methylation and piwil1 expression and that the spatiotemporal expression of chicken Piwil1 from the PGC stage to the round spermatid stage is influenced by methylation-mediated transcription factor regulation.",0,1818

Thiry-four women were enrolled before pregnancy and 116 during the first trimester of pregnancy. Global DNA (hydroxy)methylation in blood using LC-MS/MS and dietary methyl-group intake (methionine, folate, betaine, and choline) using a food-frequency questionnaire were estimated pre-pregnancy, during each trimester, and at delivery. Global DNA (hydroxy)methylation levels were highest pre-pregnancy and at weeks 18-22 of pregnancy. We observed a positive relation between folic acid and global DNA methylation (p = 0.04) and hydroxymethylation (p = 0.04). A high intake of methionine pre-pregnancy and in the first trimester showed lower (hydroxy)methylation percentage in weeks 11-13 and weeks 18-22, respectively. Choline and betaine intake in the first weeks was negatively associated with hydroxymethylation. Women with a high intake of these three methyl groups in the second and third trimester showed higher hyrdoxymethylation/methylation levels in the third trimester.

Here, we quantified promoter methylation of candidate genes and global methylation in 44 small intestinal-neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) from 33 patients by pyrosequencing. Findings were compared with gene expression, patient outcome and known tumor copy number alterations. Promoter methylation was observed for WIF1, RASSF1A, CTNNB1, CXCL14, NKX2-3, P16, LAMA1, and CDH1. By contrast APC, CDH3, HIC1, P14, SMAD2, and SMAD4 only had low levels of methylation. WIF1 methylation was significantly increased (P = 0.001) and WIF1 expression was reduced in SI-NETs vs. normal references (P = 0.003). WIF1, NKX2-3, and CXCL14 expression was reduced in metastases vs. primary tumors (P<0.02). Low expression of RASSF1A and P16 were associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.045 and P = 0.011, respectively). Global methylation determined by pyrosequencing of LINE1 repeats was reduced in tumors vs. normal references, and was associated with loss in chromosome 18. The tumors fell into three clusters with enrichment of WIF1 methylation and LINE1 hypomethylation in Cluster I and RASSF1A and CTNNB1 methylation and loss in 16q in Cluster II. In Cluster III, these alterations were low-abundant and NKX2-3 methylation was low. Similar analyses in the SI-NET cell lines HC45 and CNDT2 showed methylation for CDH1 and WIF1 and/or P16, CXCL14, NKX2-3, LAMA1, and CTNNB1. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine reduced DNA methylation and increased expression of these genes in vitro.

Since MGMT is highly epigenetically regulated, the MGMT promoter methylation status is taken as an indicator of MGMT silencing, predicting the outcome of glioma therapy. MGMT promoter methylation is usually determined by methylation specific PCR (MSP), which is a labor intensive and error-prone method often used semi-quantitatively. Searching for alternatives, we used closed-tube high resolution melt (HRM) analysis, which is a quantitative method, and compared it with MSP and pyrosequencing regarding its predictive value. RESULTS: We analyzed glioblastoma cell lines with known MGMT activity and formalin-fixed samples from IDH1 wild-type high-grade glioma patients (WHO grade III/IV) treated with radiation and temozolomide by HRM, MSP, and pyrosequencing. The data were compared as to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients exhibiting the methylated and unmethylated MGMT status. A promoter methylation cut-off level relevant for PFS and OS was determined. In a multivariate Cox regression model, methylation of MGMT promoter of high-grade gliomas analyzed by HRM, but not MSP, was found to be an independent predictive marker for OS. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed for PFS and OS a significant and better discrimination between methylated and unmethylated tumors when quantitative HRM was used instead of MSP. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to MSP and pyrosequencing, the HRM method is simple, cost effective, highly accurate and fast. HRM is at least equivalent to pyrosequencing in quantifying the methylation level. It is superior in predicting PFS and OS of high-grade glioma patients compared to MSP and, therefore, can be recommended being used routinely for determination of the MGMT status of gliomas.",4.543,1755

We explored DNA methylation patterns in association with gene expression to assess their impact on the prognosis of breast cancer based on Infinium 450K arrays (training set) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The DNA methylation patterns of 12 featured genes that had a high correlation with gene expression were identified through univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and used to define the methylation risk score (MRS). An improved ability to distinguish the power of the DNA methylation pattern from the 12 featured genes (p = 0.00103) was observed compared with the average methylation levels (p = 0.956) or gene expression (p = 0.909). Furthermore, MRS provided a good prognostic value for breast cancers even when the patients had the same receptor status. We found that ER-, PR- or Her2- samples with high-MRS had the worst 5-year survival rate and overall survival time. An independent test set including 28 patients with death as an outcome was used to test the validity of the MRS of the 12 featured genes; this analysis obtained a prognostic value equivalent to the training set. The predict power was validated through two independent datasets from the GEO database. The DNA methylation pattern is a powerful predictor of breast cancer survival, and can predict outcomes of the same breast cancer molecular subtypes.",3.234,1147

Because it can be influenced by the environment, DNA methylation may contribute to the ability of organisms to acclimatize and adapt to environmental change. We evaluated the distribution of gene body methylation in reef-building corals, a group of organisms facing significant environmental threats. Gene body methylation in six species of corals was inferred from in silico transcriptome analysis of CpG O/E, an estimate of germline DNA methylation that is highly correlated with patterns of methylation enrichment. Consistent with what has been documented in most other invertebrates, all corals exhibited bimodal distributions of germline methylation suggestive of distinct fractions of genes with high and low levels of methylation. The hypermethylated fractions were enriched with genes with housekeeping functions, while genes with inducible functions were highly represented in the hypomethylated fractions. High transcript abundance was associated with intermediate levels of methylation. In three of the coral species, we found that genes differentially expressed in response to thermal stress and ocean acidification exhibited significantly lower levels of methylation. These results support a link between gene body hypomethylation and transcriptional plasticity that may point to a role of DNA methylation in the response of corals to environmental change.",6.494,857

Further exploration of a set of CpG sites in the proximity of four a priori defined candidate genes (CYP24A1, CYP27B1, CYP27A1 and CYP2R1) did not result in any associations with FDR<0.05 (56 tests). In this large genome wide assessment of the potential influence of maternal vitamin D status on DNA methylation, we did not find any convincing associations in 1416 newborns.

If the targeted DNA has promoter function, this RNA-directed DNA methylation may result in transcriptional gene silencing. In a genetic screen for factors involved in RNA-directed transcriptional silencing of a ProNOS-NPTII reporter transgene in Arabidopsis thaliana, we captured alleles of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2, the gene encoding the DNA methyltransferase that is mainly responsible for de novo DNA methylation in the context of RNA-directed DNA methylation. Interestingly, methylation of the reporter gene ProNOS was not completely erased in these mutants, but persisted in the symmetric CG context, indicating that RNA-directed DNA methylation had been consolidated by DNA methylation maintenance. Taking advantage of the segregation of the transgenes giving rise to ProNOS short interfering RNAs and carrying the ProNOS-NPTII reporter in our experimental system, we found that ProNOS DNA methylation maintenance was first evident after two generations of ongoing RNA-directed DNA methylation, and then increased in extent with further generations. As ProNOS DNA methylation had already reached its final level in the first generation of RNA-directed DNA methylation, our findings suggest that establishment of DNA methylation at a particular region may be divided into distinct stages. An initial phase of efficient, but still fully reversible, de novo DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing is followed by transition to efficient maintenance of cytosine methylation in a symmetric sequence context accompanied by persistence of gene silencing.",0,1335

Numerous social insect species have been found to possess a functioning methylation system, previously not thought to exist in insects. Methylation, an epigenetic tag, may be vital for the sociality and division of labour for which social insects are renowned. In the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris, we found methylation differences between the genomes of queenless reproductive workers and queenless non-reproductive workers. In a follow up experiment, queenless workers whose genomes had experimentally altered methylation were more aggressive and more likely to develop ovaries compared with control queenless workers. This shows methylation is important in this highly plastic reproductive division of labour. Methylation is an epigenetic tag for genomic imprinting (GI). It is intriguing that the main theory to explain the evolution of GI predicts that GI should be important in this worker reproduction behaviour.",0,808

This study-for the first time applying a multilevel epigenetic approach-investigates the role of OXTR gene methylation in categorical, dimensional, and intermediate neuroendocrinological/neural network phenotypes of social anxiety. A total of 110 unmedicated patients with SAD and matched 110 controls were analyzed for OXTR methylation by direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite-converted DNA extracted from whole blood. Furthermore, OXTR methylation was investigated regarding SAD-related traits (Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)), salivary cortisol response during the Trier social stress test (TSST), and amygdala responsiveness to social phobia related verbal stimuli using fMRI. Significantly decreased OXTR methylation particularly at CpG Chr3: 8 809 437 was associated with (1) the categorical phenotype of SAD (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.535), (2) increased SPS and SIAS scores (p<0.001), (3) increased cortisol response to the TSST (p=0.02), and (4) increased amygdala responsiveness during social phobia-related word processing (right: p(corr)<0.001; left: p(corr)=0.005). Assuming that decreased OXTR methylation confers increased OXTR expression, the present finding may reflect a compensatory upregulation for pathologically reduced oxytocin levels or a causally relevant increased OXTR activation in SAD and related traits. OXTR methylation patterns might thus serve as peripheral surrogates of oxytocin tone and aid in establishing accessible biomarkers of SAD risk allowing for indicated preventive interventions and personalized treatment approaches targeting the oxytocin system.",7.048,981

SUMMARY ANSWER: Geographical region resulted associated with the sperm methylation status assessed on genome-wide repetitive sequences. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: DNA methylation level, assessed on repetitive sequences from peripheral blood lymphocyte, can vary with age, gender, alcohol consumption and white blood cell counts. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional study. Individual data were collected from 269 young healthy men of proven fertility living in three geographical regions: Inuits from Greenland, Caucasians from Warsaw (Poland) and Kharkiv (Ukraine). Semen samples were collected between May 2002 and February 2004 and aliquots were immediately frozen. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We estimated sperm DNA global methylation level (DGML) in two ways. First DNA methylation in repetitive DNA sequences (LINE-1, Satalpha and Alu) was quantified by PCR pyrosequencing after bisulfite conversion and second by flow cytometry (FCM) using fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies anti-5-methylcytosine. We analyzed whether personal characteristics and habits, body mass index, semen quality parameters, sperm chromatin integrity, biomarkers of accessory gland function and the plasma concentration of reproductive hormones were associated with sperm DNA methylation levels in men. Associations were evaluated by analysis of variance and linear regression analyses. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The geographical location emerged as the main determinant when using the methylation level in repetitive sequences. FCM DGML results were not associated with those from repetitive sequence analysis. No other consistent associations between methylation markers and the assessed variables were identified across countries. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The methods used are only surrogates of the actual sperm methylome and the methylation levels at individual specific loci were not explored. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Sperm DGML is relatively independent from semen quality parameters and is a new candidate biomarker for epidemiological studies of the impact of environmental contaminants on male fertility.

The Tat-derived peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis. TAR RNA binding of the peptides was assessed by electrophoresis mobility shift assays. The cellular uptake of the peptides into Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. Our results showed that RNA recognition was affected by both methylation state and position. In particular, asymmetric dimethylation at position 53 decreased TAR RNA binding affinity significantly, but unexpectedly less so upon asymmetric dimethylation at position 52. The RNA binding affinity even slightly increased upon methylation at some of the flanking Arg residues. Upon Arg methylation, the cellular uptake of Tat-derived peptides mostly decreased. Interestingly, cellular uptake of Tat-derived peptides with a single asymmetrically dimethylated Arg residue was similar to the native all Arg peptide (at 120 muM). Based on our results, TAR RNA binding apparently required both guanidinium terminal NH groups on Arg53, whereas cellular uptake apparently required guanidinium terminal NH(2) groups instead. These results should provide insight into how nature uses arginine methylation to regulate different biological functions, and should be useful for the development of functional molecules with methylated arginines.",2.793,24

The selected mono-amino acid derivatives Ac-X-OMe, where X = Gly, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Met, Cys, Ser, Asp and His as well as their corresponding N-methylated analogues were studied. The clog P values of all N-methylated peptides are greater than those of native compounds. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to estimate the aqueous solubility of these lipophilic compounds using density functional theory (DFT). To confirm the contribution of dispersion forces on quantum chemical data, the long-range corrected (LC) hybrid density functional (omegaB97X-D) was also probed for some amino acid derivatives. The omegaB97X functional gave similar results. Our results reveal that after mono N-methylation of the peptide backbone, DeltaGsolv becomes more negative (more water soluble) while polarizability and dipole moment are also increased. Natural atomic charges derived by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of N, C, and O atoms involved in amide functional group become more positive/(less negative) after N-methylation. All N-methylated amino acids have higher EHOMO (less negative) in comparison with the amino acid analogues, and in all cases N-methylation decreases EHOMO-LUMO. The calculated amide cis/trans activation energies (EA) of all the N-methylated amino acid derivatives were lower than that of native species. N-methylation of these compounds leads to an increase in lipophilicity, aqueous solubility, polarization, dipole moment and lowering of the cis/trans amide energy barrier (EA).",3.562,59

In the present study a screening cohort composed by late-onset AD (LOAD) patients and healthy matched controls was evaluated with a commercially available DNA methylation array for the assessment of the methylation levels of a panel of 22 genes involved in major DNA repair pathways in blood DNA. We then applied a cost-effective PCR based methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) technique, in order to evaluate the promoter methylation levels of the following DNA repair genes: OGG1, PARP1, MRE11A, BRCA1, MLH1, and MGMT. The analysis was performed in blood DNA from 56 LOAD patients and 55 matched controls, including the samples previously assessed with the DNA methylation array as validating samples. Both approaches revealed that all the investigated genes were largely hypomethylated in LOAD and control blood DNA, and no difference between groups was observed. Collectively, present data do not support an increased promoter methylation of some of the major DNA repair genes in blood DNA of AD patients.",3.397,1365

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) was recently found playing an important regulatory role in mental disorders. However, little was known about the DNA methylation of lncRNAs, although numerous SCZ studies have been performed on genetic polymorphisms or epigenetic marks in protein coding genes. We presented a comprehensive genome wide DNA methylation study of both protein coding genes and lncRNAs in female patients with paranoid and undifferentiated SCZ. Using the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) protein-enriched genome sequencing (MBD-seq), 8,163 and 764 peaks were identified in paranoid and undifferentiated SCZ, respectively (p < 1 x 10-5). Gene ontology analysis showed that the hypermethylated regions were enriched in the genes related to neuron system and brain for both paranoid and undifferentiated SCZ (p < 0.05). Among these peaks, 121 peaks were located in gene promoter regions that might affect gene expression and influence the SCZ related pathways. Interestingly, DNA methylation of 136 and 23 known lncRNAs in Refseq database were identified in paranoid and undifferentiated SCZ, respectively. In addition,  approximately 20% of intergenic peaks annotated based on Refseq genes were overlapped with lncRNAs in UCSC and gencode databases. In order to show the results well for most biological researchers, we created an online database to display and visualize the information of DNA methyation peaks in both types of SCZ (http://www.bioinfo.org/scz/scz.htm). Our results showed that the aberrant DNA methylation of lncRNAs might be another important epigenetic factor for SCZ.",1.466,1573

Here, we aimed to establish a DNA methylation marker to estimate the fraction of gastric cancer (GC) cells in any DNA sample by isolating genomic regions specifically methylated in GC cells. METHODS: Genome-wide and gene-specific methylation analyses were conducted with an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and by quantitative methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Purified cancer and noncancer cells were prepared by laser-capture microdissection. TP53 mutation data were obtained from our previous study using next-generation target sequencing. RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 12 GC cell lines, 30 GCs, six normal gastric mucosae, one sample of peripheral leukocytes, and four noncancerous gastric mucosae identified OSR2, PPFIA3, and VAV3 as barely methylated in normal cells and highly methylated in cancer cells. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR using 26 independent GCs validated that one or more of them was highly methylated in all of the GCs. Using four pairs of purified cells, we confirmed the three genes were highly methylated (85 % or more) in cancer cells and barely methylated (5 % or less) in noncancer cells. The cancer cell fraction assessed by the panel of the three genes showed good correlation with that assessed by the TP53 mutant allele frequency in 13 GCs (r = 0.77). After correction of the GC cell fraction, unsupervised clustering analysis of the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles yielded clearer clustering. CONCLUSIONS: A DNA methylation marker-namely, the panel of the three genes-is useful to estimate the cancer cell fraction in GCs.",0,860

Since active smoking contributes to a wide spectrum of aging-related diseases in adults, this study intended to examine whether active smoking exposure could accelerate the DNA methylation age in forms of age acceleration (AA, residuals of the DNA methylation age estimate regressed on chronological age). We obtained the DNA methylation profiles in whole blood samples by Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip array in two independent subsamples of the ESTHER study and calculated their DNA methylation ages by two recently proposed algorithms. None of the self-reported smoking indicators (smoking status, cumulative exposure and smoking cessation time) or serum cotinine levels was significantly associated with AA. On the contrary, we successfully confirmed that 66 out of 150 smoking-related CpG sites were associated with AA, even after correction for multiple testing (FDR <0.05). We further built a smoking index (SI) based on these loci and demonstrated a monotonic dose-response relationship of this index with AA. In conclusion, DNA methylation-based biological indicators for current and past smoking exposure, but not self-reported smoking information or serum cotinine levels, were found to be related to DNA methylation defined AA. Further research should address potential mechanisms underlying the observed patterns, such as potential reflections of susceptibility to environmental hazards in both smoking related methylation changes and methylation defined AA.",6.359,1005

Recent studies have revealed distinct subtypes of DNA methylation in colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the mechanism of heterogeneous methylation remains poorly understood. Gene expression is a natural, intermediate quantitative trait that bridges genotypic and phenotypic features. In this work, we studied the role of heterogeneous DNA methylation in tumorigenesis via gene expression analyses. Specifically, we integrated methylation and expression data in normal and tumor tissues, and examined the perturbations in coexpression patterns. We found that the heterogeneity of methylation leads to significant loss of coexpression connectivity in CRC; this finding was validated in an independent cohort. Functional analyses showed that the lost coexpression partners participate in important cancer-related pathways/networks, such as ErbB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Our analyses suggest that the loss of coexpression connectivity induced by methylation heterogeneity might play an important role in CRC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to interpret methylation heterogeneity in cancer from the perspective of coexpression perturbation. Our results provide new perspectives in tumor biology and may facilitate the identification of potential biomedical therapies for cancer treatment.",4.041,1048

Oral leukoplakias (OLs), known as the most common premalignant lesions in the oral cavity, often precede OSCCs. Especially, OLs with dysplasia are known to have a high risk of malignant transformation. Here, we searched for the promoter methylation characteristic of high-risk OLs. METHODS: To identify methylation-silenced genes, a combined analysis of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) - CpG island (CGI) microarray analysis and expression microarray analysis after treatment with a demethylating agent was performed in two OSCC cell lines (Ca9-22 and HSC-2). The methylation statuses of each gene were examined by methylation-specific PCR. RESULTS: A total of 52 genes were identified as candidates for methylation-silenced genes in Ca9-22 or HSC-2. The promoter regions of 13 genes among the 15 genes randomly selected for further analysis were confirmed to be methylated in one or more of five cell lines. In OSCC tissues (n = 26), 8 of the 13 genes, TSPYL5, EGFLAM, CLDN11, NKX2-3, RBP4, CMTM3, TRPC4, and MAP6, were methylated. In OL tissues (n = 24), seven of the eight genes, except for EGFLAM, were found to be methylated in their promoter regions. There were significantly greater numbers of methylated genes in OLs with dysplasia than in those without dysplasia (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: OLs at high risk for malignant transformation were associated with aberrant promoter methylation of multiple genes.",3.362,606

Thanks to this methyltransferase, the activity of which is cell cycle regulated, the chromosome transitions between a hemimethylated state in the S-phase to a fully methylated condition in the G1 and G2 phases. Any perturbation in CcrM expression, such as depletion or constitutive expression, causes severe developmental defects. Several studies suggest that the role of CcrM is conserved across the Alphaproteobacteria. In the past few years, the importance of methylation on the expression of cell cycle regulated genes has emerged, suggesting that CcrM-dependent methylation can direct the binding of transcription factors to specific methylated sequences and affect the expression of genes depending on the methylation state of their promoters. CcrM activity has recently been linked to GcrA, a cell cycle master regulator that controls the expression of several genes during S-phase. Here, we review recent findings that establish the global role of methylation in cell cycle progression, and also explore the significance of a CcrM-GcrA epigenetic module that has co-evolved in Alphaproteobacteria, including Caulobacter, in controlling several genes involved in cell division, polarity, and motility.",9.186,1914

 States of America",2015,"The maize genome is relatively large ( approximately  2.3 Gb) and has a complex organization of interspersed genes and transposable elements, which necessitates frequent boundaries between different types of chromatin. The examination of maize genes and conserved noncoding sequences revealed that many of these are flanked by regions of elevated asymmetric CHH (where H is A, C, or T) methylation (termed mCHH islands). These mCHH islands are quite short ( approximately  100 bp), are enriched near active genes, and often occur at the edge of the transposon that is located nearest to genes. The analysis of DNA methylation in other sequence contexts and several chromatin modifications revealed that mCHH islands mark the transition from heterochromatin-associated modifications to euchromatin-associated modifications. The presence of an mCHH island is fairly consistent in several distinct tissues that were surveyed but shows some variation among different haplotypes. The presence of insertion/deletions in promoters often influences the presence and position of an mCHH island. The mCHH islands are dependent upon RNA-directed DNA methylation activities and are lost in mop1 and mop3 mutants, but the nearby genes rarely exhibit altered expression levels. Instead, loss of an mCHH island is often accompanied by additional loss of DNA methylation in CG and CHG contexts associated with heterochromatin in nearby transposons. This suggests that mCHH islands and RNA-directed DNA methylation near maize genes may act to preserve the silencing of transposons from activity of nearby genes.",9.674,229

 European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical
 Oncology",2014,"AIM: In rectal cancer, not all tumours display a response to neoadjuvant treatment. An accurate predictor of response does not exist to guide patient-specific treatment. DNA methylation is a distinctive molecular pathway in colorectal carcinogenesis. Whether DNA methylation is altered by neoadjuvant treatment and a potential response predictor is unknown. We aimed to determine whether DNA methylation is altered by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and to determine its role in predicting response to treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three (n = 53) patients with locally advanced rectal cancers treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery were identified from the pathology databases of 2 tertiary referral centres over a 4-year period. Immunohistochemical staining of treatment specimens was carried out using the 5-Methylcytidine (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) antibody. Quantitative analysis of staining was performed using an automated image analysis platform. The modified tumour regression grading system was used to assess tumour response to neoadjuvant therapy. RESULTS: Seven (13%) patients showed complete pathological response while 46 (87%) patients were partial responders to neoadjuvant treatment. In 38 (72%) patients, significant reduction in methylation was observed in post-treatment resection specimens compared to pre-treatment specimens (171.5 vs 152.7, p = 0.01); in 15 (28%) patients, methylation was increased. Pre-treatment methylation correlated significantly with tumour regression (p < 0.001), T-stage (p = 0.005), and was able to predict complete and partial pathological responders (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant CRT appears to alter the rectal cancer epigenome. The significant correlation between pre-treatment DNA methylation with tumour response suggests a potential role for methylation as a biomarker of response.",2.649,1109

Assessment of DNA methylation of specific genes is one approach to the diagnosis of cancer worldwide. Early stage detection is necessary to reduce the mortality rate of cancers, including those occurring in the stomach. For this purpose, tumor cells in circulating blood offer promising candidates for non-invasive diagnosis. Transcriptional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, like PCDH10 and RASSF1A, by methylation is associated with progression of gastric cancer, and such methylation can therefore be utilized as a biomarker. Methods. The present research was conducted to evaluate DNA methylation in these two genes using blood samples of gastric cancer cases. Clinicopathological data were also analyzed and cumulative survival rates generated for comparison. Results. High frequencies of PCDH10 and RASSF1A methylations in the gastric cancer group were noted (94.1% and 83.2%, respectively, as compared to 2.97% and 5.45% in 202 matched controls). Most patients (53.4%) were in severe stage of the disease, with a median survival time of 8.4 months after diagnosis. Likewise, the patients with metastases, or RASSF1A and PCDH10 methylations, had median survival times of 7.3, 7.8, and 8.4 months, respectively. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that cumulative survival was significantly lower in those cases positive for methylation of RASSF1A than in their negative counterparts. Similarly, whereas almost 100% of patients positive for PCDH10 methylation had died after five years, none of the negative cases died over this period. Notably, the methylations of RASSF1A and PCDH10 were found to be higher in the late-stage patients and were also significantly correlated with metastasis and histology. Conclusions. PCDH10 and RASSF1A methylations in blood samples can serve as potential non-invasive diagnostic indicators in blood for gastric cancer. In addition to RASSF1A methylation, tumor stage proved to be a major prognostic factor in terms of survival rates.",2.112,1301

Previously, we identified Group 1 and Group 2 methylation markers through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, and classified CRC and protruded adenoma into three distinct clusters: high-, intermediate- and low-methylation epigenotypes. High-methylation epigenotype strongly correlated with BRAF mutations and these aberrations were involved in the serrated pathway, whereas intermediate-methylation epigenotype strongly correlated with KRAS mutations. Here, we investigated laterally spreading tumors (LSTs), which are flat, early CRC lesions, through quantitative methylation analysis of six Group 1 and 14 Group 2 methylation markers using pyrosequencing. Gene mutations in BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA, and immunostaining of TP53 and CTNNB1 as well as other clinicopathological factors were also evaluated. By hierarchical clustering using methylation information, LSTs were classified into two subtypes; intermediate-methylation epigenotype correlating with KRAS mutations (p = 9 x 10(-4)) and a granular morphology (LST-G) (p = 1 x 10(-7)), and low-methylation epigenotype correlating with CTNNB1 activation (p = 0.002) and a nongranular morphology (LST-NG) (p = 1 x 10(-7)). Group 1 marker methylation and BRAF mutations were barely detected, suggesting that high-methylation epigenotype was unlikely to be involved in LST development. TP53 mutations correlated significantly with malignant transformation, regardless of epigenotype or morphology type. Together, this may suggest that two molecular pathways, intermediate methylation associated with KRAS mutations and LST-G morphology, and low methylation associated with CTNNB1 activation and LST-NG morphology, might be involved in LST development, and that involvement of TP53 mutations could be important in both subtypes in the development from adenoma to cancer.",5.085,1341

In the current study, we investigated the methylation status within thelgr5 promoter and evaluated its relationship with CSC differentiation, prognosis for colorectal cancer, and its clinicopathological features. METHODS: The methylation status within Lgr5 promoter was detected with a methylation-specific PCR in six colorectal cancer cell lines as well as 169 primary colorectal tumor tissues. Differentiation of CSC was examined with immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. Down-regulation of lgr5 was achieved with gene-specific siRNA. The associations between lgr5 methylation and the clinicopathological features as well as survival of patients were analyzed with statistical methods. RESULTS: The lgr5 promoter was methylated to different degrees for the six colorectal cell lines examined, with complete methylation observed in HCT116 cells in which the lgr5 expression was partially recovered following DAC treatment. The stem-cell sphere formation from HCT116 cells was accompanied by increasing methylation within the lgr5 promoter and decreasing expression of lgr5. Knocking down lgr5 by siRNA also led to stem-cell spheres formation. Among primary colorectal tumors, 40% (67/169) were positive for lgr5 methylation, while none of the normal colon tissues were positive for lgr5 methylation. Furthermore, lgr5 methylation significantly associated with higher tumor grade, and negative distant metastasis (p < 0.05), as well as better prognosis (p = 0.001) in patients with colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that lgr5 methylation, through the regulation of lgr5 expression and colorectal CSC differentiation, may constitute a novel prognostic marker for colorectal cancer patients.",3.234,1195

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of paired boxed gene 1 (PAX1) methylation for cervical cancer screening in Asians. METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved by searching the electronic databases, and the quality of the enrolled studies was assessed via the quality assessment for studies of diagnostic accuracy (QUADAS) tool. The bivariate meta-analysis model was employed to generate the summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve using Stata 12.0 software. Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics were applied to assess heterogeneity among studies. Publication bias was evaluated by the Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test. RESULTS: A total of 9 articles containing 15 individual studies were included. The SROC analysis showed that single PAX1 methylation allowed for the discrimination between cancer/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) patients and normal individuals with a sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of 0.80 (0.70 - 0.87) and specificity of 0.89 (0.86 - 0.92), corresponding to an area under curve (AUC) of 0.92. Notably, our subgroup analysis suggested that combing parallel testing of PAX1 methylation and HPV DNA (AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.90, 0.82, and 0.84, respectively) seemed to harbor higher accuracy than single HPV DNA testing (AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.81, 0.86, and 0.67, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PAX1 methylation hallmarks a potential diagnostic value for cervical cancer screening in Asians, and parallel testing of PAX1 methylation and HPV in cervical scrapings confers an improved accuracy than single HPV DNA testing.",1.129,224

If the majority of cells have an active (demethylated) intracisternal A particle (IAP), mice have a yellow coat color and develop adult-onset obesity and diabetes, while mice whose mosaicism predominantly reflects an inactive (methylated) IAP are pseudoagouti (brown) and less prone to metabolic disease. Brown and yellow coat color A(vy)/a post-weaning mice were placed on one of three diets [AIN, and two lower-calorie diets National Institutes of Health (NIH) and methyl-supplemented, NIHMe] to determine whether coat color, weight gain, blood glucose and methylation of hepatic IAP became altered. None of the diets altered A(vy)/a mice coat color. NIHMe did not protect against increasing obesity or the usual onset of hyperglycemia in males. Nor did it promote increased methylation of A(vy) IAP in liver tissue. By contrast, AIN, despite its higher content of fat and carbohydrate and ability to promote greater weight gains than the NIH and NIHMe diets, protected males better against hyperglycemia than either the NIH or NIHMe diets. This diet led to a significantly reduced (~50%; P = .003) average methylation state of all CpG sites within the hepatic IAP for the pseudoagouti mice. On AIN, but not on the other diets, extent of hepatic IAP methylation was negatively correlated (R = 0.97, P </= .001) with body weight of pseudoagouti mice. The findings indicate that post-weaning diet might influence interpretation of studies with A(vy)/a mice because IAP methylation patterns may be malleable in certain organs and influenced by post-weaning diet.",0,551

N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is an abundant internal modification in messenger RNA and long non-coding RNA that can be dynamically added and removed by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) and demethylases, respectively. An MTase complex comprising methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) efficiently catalyses methyl group transfer. In contrast to the well-studied DNA MTase, the exact roles of these two RNA MTases in the complex remain to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal structures of the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer with MTase domains in the ligand-free, S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)-bound and S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy)-bound states, with resolutions of 1.9, 1.71 and 1.61 A, respectively. Both METTL3 and METTL14 adopt a class I MTase fold and they interact with each other via an extensive hydrogen bonding network, generating a positively charged groove. Notably, AdoMet was observed in only the METTL3 pocket and not in METTL14. Combined with biochemical analysis, these results suggest that in the m(6)A MTase complex, METTL3 primarily functions as the catalytic core, while METTL14 serves as an RNA-binding platform, reminiscent of the target recognition domain of DNA N(6)-adenine MTase. This structural information provides an important framework for the functional investigation of m(6)A.",41.456,1320

Germination is then mediated by germination stimulant-dependent activation of PrCYP707A1, an abscisic acid catabolic gene. The molecular mechanisms occurring during the conditioning period that silence PrCYP707A1 expression and regulate germination stimulant response are almost unknown. Here, global DNA methylation quantification associated with pharmacological approaches and cytosine methylation analysis of the PrCYP707A1 promoter were used to investigate the modulation and possible role of DNA methylation during the conditioning period and in the PrCYP707A1 response to GR24, a synthetic strigolactone analogue. Active global DNA demethylation occurs during the conditioning period and is required for PrCYP707A1 activation by GR24 and for subsequent seed germination. Treatment with 5-azacytidine, a DNA-hypomethylating molecule, reduces the length of the conditioning period. Conversely, hydroxyurea, a hypermethylating agent, inhibits PrCYP707A1 expression and seed germination. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by PCR experiments and bisulfite sequencing revealed that DNA demethylation particularly impacts a 78-nucleotide sequence in the PrCYP707A1 promoter.

 published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association",2014,"The goal of the present study was to compare the arsenic methylation capacities in elementary school and junior high school students in an area of Taiwan with low arsenic exposure, and explore the influence of both arsenic methylation capacity and obesity on insulin resistance in these children and adolescents using the HOMA-IR index. We recruited 303 elementary school students and 319 junior high school students in Taipei City from September 2007 to November 2011. Concentrations of inorganic arsenic (arsenite + arsenate), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry. Insulin resistance was determined by HOMA-IR. Elementary school students had significantly lower inorganic arsenic percentage and a higher DMA(V) percentage than junior high school students. It seems that the former had better arsenic methylation capability than the latter. The HOMA-IR value was significantly and positively related to the sum of the urinary inorganic and methylated arsenic (TotalAs) concentrations and also the BMI Z score, with the regression coefficients (beta) being 0.058 (p < 0.001) and 0.001 (p = 0.027), respectively. The higher BMI values and higher TotalAs concentration were associated with higher HOMA-IR values in children and adolescents in Taiwan.",2.895,569

MTHFR C667T loci polymorphism is closely associated with homocysteine level. This study aimed to investigate the relationship among MTHFR C667T loci polymorphism, genome-wide methylation, and atherosclerosis. MATERIAL/METHODS: Blood sample was collected from 105 patients with coronary atherosclerosis and 105 healthy controls. Pyrosequencing methylation was used to detect LINE-1 methylation level. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to test MTHFR. RESULTS: LINE-1 methylation level in the patient group was significantly lower than in the controls (t=5.007, P<0.001). MTHFR C667T genotype distribution presented marked differences in the 2 groups. TT genotype carriers had significantly increased risk of atherosclerosis (OR=3.56, P=0.009). Three different genotypes of MTHFR C667T loci showed different LINE-1 methylation level between the 2 groups (P<0.01). LINE-1 methylation level in TT and CT genotype carriers was obviously lower than in CC genotype carriers (P<0.05).

27542345,Gene-specific DNA methylation may mediate atypical antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance.,"['Burghardt KJ', 'Goodrich JM', 'Dolinoy DC', 'Ellingrod VL']",Bipolar disorders,2016,"OBJECTIVES: Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) carry a significant risk of cardiometabolic side effects, including insulin resistance. It is thought that the insulin resistance resulting from the use of AAPs may be associated with changes in DNA methylation. We aimed to identify and validate a candidate gene associated with AAP-induced insulin resistance by using a multi-step approach that included an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and validation with site-specific methylation and metabolomics data. METHODS: Subjects with bipolar disorder treated with AAPs or lithium monotherapy were recruited for a cross-sectional visit to analyze peripheral blood DNA methylation and insulin resistance. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed in a discovery sample (n = 48) using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Validation analyses of the epigenome-wide findings occurred in a separate sample (n = 72) using site-specific methylation with pyrosequencing and untargeted metabolomics data. Regression analyses were conducted controlling for known confounders in all analyses and a mediation analysis was performed to investigate if AAP-induced insulin resistance occurs through changes in DNA methylation. RESULTS: A differentially methylated probe associated with insulin resistance was discovered and validated in the fatty acyl CoA reductase 2 (FAR2) gene of chromosome 12. Functional associations of this DNA methylation site with untargeted phospholipid-related metabolites were also detected. Our results identified a mediating effect of this FAR2 methylation site on AAP-induced insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Going forward, prospective, longitudinal studies assessing comprehensive changes in FAR2 DNA methylation, expression, and lipid metabolism before and after AAP treatment are required to assess its potential role in the development of insulin resistance.",4.965,462

The existing software for methylation analysis does not seem to scale efficiently neither with the size of the dataset nor with the length of the reads to be analyzed. As it is expected that the sequencers will provide longer and longer reads in the near future, efficient and scalable methylation software should be developed. RESULTS: We present a new software tool, called HPG-Methyl, which efficiently maps bisulphite sequencing reads on DNA, analyzing DNA methylation. The strategy used by this software consists of leveraging the speed of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform to map a large number of DNA fragments (reads) rapidly, as well as the accuracy of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which is exclusively employed to deal with the most ambiguous and shortest reads. Experimental results on platforms with Intel multicore processors show that HPG-Methyl significantly outperforms in both execution time and sensitivity state-of-the-art software such as Bismark, BS-Seeker or BSMAP, particularly for long bisulphite reads.

We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: betaage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); betaHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: betaage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); betaHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging.",3.234,1210
26037613,N-mustard analogs of S-adenosyl-L-methionine as biochemical probes of protein arginine methylation.,"['Hymbaugh Bergman SJ', 'Comstock LR']",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2015,"Nucleosomes, the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, undergo post-synthetic modifications and play a major role in the regulation of transcriptional processes. Combinations of these modifications, including methylation, regulate chromatin structure, determining its different functional states and playing a central role in differentiation. The biological significance of cellular methylation, particularly on chromatin, is widely recognized, yet we know little about the mechanisms that link biological methylation events. To characterize and fully understand protein methylation, we describe here novel N-mustard analogs of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as biochemical tools to better understand protein arginine methylation events using protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Specifically, azide- and alkyne-functionalized N-mustard analogs serve as cofactor mimics of SAM and are enzymatically transferred to a model peptide substrate in a PRMT1-dependent fashion. Once incorporated, the resulting alkynes and azides can be modified through chemoselective ligations, including click chemistry and the Staudinger ligation. These results readily demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing N-mustard analogs as biochemical tools to site-specifically label substrates of PRMT1 and serve as an alternative approach to study protein methylation events.",2.793,15

The mechanism of these regulations might depend on epigenetic changes in global or gene-specific DNA methylation levels. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in maintenance of energy homeostasis and is activated by increases in the AMP/ATP ratio as occurring in skeletal muscles after sporting activity. To analyze whether exercise has an impact on the methylation status of the AMPK promoter, we determined the AMPK methylation status in human blood samples from patients before and after sporting activity in the context of rehabilitation as well as in skeletal muscles of trained and untrained mice. Further, we examined long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) as indicator of global DNA methylation changes. Our results revealed that light sporting activity in mice and humans does not alter global DNA methylation but has an effect on methylation of specific CpG sites in the AMPKalpha2 gene. These regulations were associated with a reduced AMPKalpha2 mRNA and protein expression in muscle tissue, pointing at a contribution of the methylation status to AMPK expression. Taken together, these results suggest that exercise influences AMPKalpha2 gene methylation in human blood and eminently in the skeletal muscle of mice and therefore might repress AMPKalpha2 gene expression.",2.297,688

MeHg concentration levels, methylation rates leading to MeHg formation, and methylation index (MI) are all used to assess the compliance of mercury to be methylated in the marine sedimentary environment. This paper reports on the works conducted on the MI upgrade. This paper proposes a new formula for calculating MI. Apart from labile mercury(II) and organic matter, it includes redox potential and abundance of sulfur-reducing bacteria (SRB), both essential factors for MeHg generation. The obtained MI is validated against actual sedimentary MeHg concentrations proving the potential usefulness of MI as a factor characterizing status of sedimentary environment regarding possible occurrence of MeHg. Moreover, values of the methylation index in particular regions show that MI values correspond well to environmental conditions in those areas. The values calculated correlate well with MeHg concentrations; however, the correlation coefficients vary between different regions. This has been attributed to the lack of empirical coefficients. Thus, MI could be used as a characteristic of the sedimentary environment indicating the potential presence of MeHg. It could also be used in methylation rate modeling, provided that empirical constants are applied to improve model performance.",1.679,217

This study investigated whether global DNA methylation correlates with dysglycemia in the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops). Diet-induced changes in DNA methylation were observed where global DNA methylation was twofold lower in monkeys fed a high fat diet (n = 10) compared to monkeys fed a standard diet (n = 15). An inverse correlation was observed between DNA methylation, blood glucose concentrations, bodyweight, and age, although the association was not statistically significant. Consumption of a high fat diet is associated with the development of metabolic disease; thus, these results suggest the use of global DNA methylation as a biomarker to assess the risk for metabolic disease. Moreover, this study provides further support for the use of the vervet monkey as a model system to study metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Integration of altered DNA methylation profiles into predictive models could facilitate risk stratification and enable intervention strategies to inhibit disease progression. Such interventions could include lifestyle modifications, for example, the increased consumption of functional foods with the capacity to modulate DNA methylation, thus potentially reversing the disease phenotype and preventing disease.",1.969,1898

Current studies indicate that the regulation of DNA methylation to gene expression depends on the genomic locations of CpGs. Common DNA methylation patterns shared across different cell types and tissues are abundant, and they are likely involved in the basic functions of cell development, such as housekeeping functions. By way of contrast, cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns show distinct functional relevance with cell type specificity. Additionally, abnormal DNA methylation patterns are extensively involved in tumour development. Pan-cancer methylation patterns reveal common mechanisms and new similarities of different cancers, while cancer-specific patterns are relating to tumour heterogeneity and patient survival. Moreover, DNA methylation patterns in specific cancer are relevant with diverse regulatory elements such as enhancers and long non-coding RNAs. In this review, we survey the recent advances on DNA methylation patterns in normal or tumour states to illustrate their potential roles in cell development and cell canceration.",3.67,848

Analyses of methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MS-AFLP or MSAP) have been often used to assess methyl-cytosine changes in response to stress treatments and, more recently, in ecological studies of wild plant populations. MSAP technique does not require a sequenced reference genome and provides many anonymous loci randomly distributed over the genome for which the methylation status can be ascertained. Scoring of MSAP data, however, is not straightforward, and efforts are still required to standardize this step to make use of the potential to distinguish between methylation at different nucleotide contexts. Furthermore, it is not known how accurately MSAP infers genome-wide cytosine methylation levels in plants. Here, we analyse the relationship between MSAP results and the percentage of global cytosine methylation in genomic DNA obtained by HPLC analysis. A screening of literature revealed that methylation of cytosines at cleavage sites assayed by MSAP was greater than genome-wide estimates obtained by HPLC, and percentages of methylation at different nucleotide contexts varied within and across species. Concurrent HPLC and MSAP analyses of DNA from 200 individuals of the perennial herb Helleborus foetidus confirmed that methyl-cytosine was more frequent in CCGG contexts than in the genome as a whole. In this species, global methylation was unrelated to methylation at the inner CG site. We suggest that global HPLC and context-specific MSAP methylation estimates provide complementary information whose combination can improve our current understanding of methylation-based epigenetic processes in nonmodel plants.",3.712,1273

However, specific embryonic stage which is sensitive to in vitro culture conditions to alter the DNA methylation profile of the resulting blastocysts remained unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the stage specific effect of in vitro culture environment on the DNA methylation response of the resulting blastocysts. For this, embryos cultured in vitro until zygote (ZY), 4-cell (4C) or 16-cell (16C) were transferred to recipients and the blastocysts were recovery at day 7 of the estrous cycle. Another embryo group was cultured in vitro until blastocyst stage (IVP). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of ZY, 4C, 16C and IVP blastocyst groups were then determined with reference to blastocysts developed completely under in vivo condition (VO) using EmbryoGENE DNA Methylation Array. To assess the contribution of methylation changes on gene expression patterns, the DNA methylation data was superimposed to the transcriptome profile data. The degree of DNA methylation dysregulation in the promoter and/or gene body regions of the resulting blastocysts was correlated with successive stages of development the embryos advanced under in vitro culture before transfer to the in vivo condition. Genomic enrichment analysis revealed that in 4C and 16C blastocyst groups, hypermethylated loci were outpacing the hypomethylated ones in intronic, exonic, promoter and proximal promoter regions, whereas the reverse was observed in ZY blastocyst group. However, in the IVP group, as much hypermethylated as hypomethylated probes were detected in gene body and promoter regions. In addition, gene ontology analysis indicated that differentially methylated regions were found to affected several biological functions including ATP binding in the ZY group, programmed cell death in the 4C, glycolysis in 16C and genetic imprinting and chromosome segregation in IVP blastocyst groups. Furthermore, 1.6, 3.4, 3.9 and 9.4% of the differentially methylated regions that were overlapped to the transcriptome profile data were negatively correlated with the gene expression patterns in ZY, 4C, 16C and IVP blastocyst groups, respectively. Therefore, this finding indicated that suboptimal culture condition during preimplantation embryo development induced changes in the DNA methylation landscape of the resulting blastocysts in a stage dependent manner and the altered DNA methylation pattern was only partly explained the observed aberrant gene expression patterns of the blastocysts.",3.234,1149

A previously reported multiplex assay using DNA methylation markers could only discriminate between 4 types of body fluids: blood, saliva, semen, and the body fluid which originates from female reproductive organ. In the present study, we selected 15 menstrual blood-specific CpG marker candidates based on analysis of 12 genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of vaginal fluid and menstrual blood. The menstrual blood-specificity of the candidate markers was confirmed by comparison with HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data obtained for 58 samples including 12 blood, 12 saliva, 12 semen, 3 vaginal fluid, and 19 skin epidermis samples. Among 15CpG marker candidates, 3 were located in the promoter region of the SLC26A10 gene, and 2 of them (cg09696411 and cg18069290) showed high menstrual blood specificity. DNA methylation at the 2CpG markers was further tested by targeted bisulfite sequencing of 461 additional samples including 49 blood, 52 saliva, 34 semen, 125 vaginal fluid, and 201 menstrual blood. Because the 2 markers showed menstrual blood-specific methylation patterns, we modified our previous multiplex methylation SNaPshot reaction to include these 2 markers. In addition, a blood marker cg01543184 with cross reactivity to semen was replaced with cg08792630, and a semen-specific unmethylation marker cg17621389 was removed. The resultant multiplex methylation SNaPshot allowed positive identification of blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid and menstrual blood using the 9CpG markers which show a methylation signal only in the target body fluids. Because of the complexity in cell composition, menstrual bloods produced DNA methylation profiles that vary with menstrual cycle and sample collection methods, which are expected to provide more insight into forensic menstrual blood test. Moreover, because the developed multiplex methylation SNaPshot reaction includes the 4CpG markers of which specificities have been confirmed by multiple studies, it will facilitate confirmatory tests for body fluids that are frequently observed in forensic casework.",4.604,432

The role of aberrant methylation of the GPX3 promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not yet clear. We investigated the association of the status of GPX3 promoter methylation and GPX3 protein expression with the clinicopathological progression of HCC. METHODOLOGY: Sixty HCC tumor and matched non-cancerous tissues were included in this study, and methylation was examined using MSP. GPX3 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated using RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Clinicopathological data were compiled for correlation analyses. RESULTS: Among the 60 HCC cases, 76.7% (46/60) showed at elevated DNA methylation and displayed significantly lower levels of GPX3 mRNA and protein expression. Low or undetectable GPX3 protein expression was observed in 10 of 60 tumors. GPX3 promoter methylation was detected in 46 of 60 (76.7%) tumors, while no GPX3 gene promoter methylation was observed in the matched non-cancerous specimens. There was a negative correlation between promoter methylation and GPX3 mRNA levels (P<0.05). Analysis of clinicopathological data revealed that both mRNA and protein were significantly associated with portal tumor thrombosis, metastasis and differentiation. In additional, GPX3 methylation showed a relationship with portal tumor thrombosis, metastasis and differentiation.

High expression of Dnmt3b slowed leukemia development in serial transplantations and impaired leukemia stem cell (LSC) function. Forced Dnmt3b expression induced widespread DNA hypermethylation inMyc-Bcl2-induced leukemias, preferentially at gene bodies.MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis showed much less pronounced DNA hypermethylation upon Dnmt3b expression. Nonetheless, leukemogenesis was delayed in both models with a shared core set of DNA hypermethylated regions and suppression of stem cell-related genes.

Compared with differentiated cells, ADS-iPSCs possess globally decreased methylation variation, in particular in repetitive elements. Interestingly, DNA methylation variation decreases in promoter regions during differentiation but increases during reprogramming. Methylation variation in promoter regions is negatively correlated with gene expression. In addition, genes showing a bipolar methylation pattern, with both completely methylated and completely unmethylated reads, are related to the carbohydrate metabolic process, cellular development, cellular growth, proliferation, etc. CONCLUSIONS: This study delivers a way to detect cell-subset specific methylation genes in a mixed cell population and provides a better understanding of methylation dynamics during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming.",3.986,1506

This crosstalk is important for the DNA damage response and has been implicated in cancer. Here, we show that in engineered yeast strains, ubiquitins tethered to every nucleosome promote H3K79 and H3K4 methylation from a proximal as well as a more distal site, but only if in a correct orientation. This plasticity indicates that the exact location of the attachment site, the native ubiquitin-lysine linkage and ubiquitination cycles are not critical for trans-histone crosstalk in vivo. The flexibility in crosstalk also indicates that other ubiquitination events may promote H3 methylation.",9.055,1919

The modification of DNA methylation of the H19 and Peg3 genes is important in embryonic development. Therefore, the effect of fluorine on methylation of H19 and Peg3 during early mouse embryos was studied. It was shown that the H19 gene was significantly downmethylated in E2.5, E3.5, and E4.5 embryos from pregnant mice treated with 120 mg/l NaF in drinking water for 48 h. But methylation of both H19 and Peg3 genes was disrupted when the parent male mice were treated with NaF for 35 days. H19 DNA methylation decreased significantly, while Peg3 was almost completely methylated. However, when pregnant mice, mated with NaF-treated male mice, were again treated with NaF for 48 h, either H19 or Peg3 methylation in the embryos decreased significantly. In addition, the mRNA level of H19 considerably increased in E3.5 and E4.5 embryos from NaF-treated pregnant mice. Further, the expression of DNMT1 decreased significantly after NaF treatment. Conclusively, we demonstrated that fluorine may adversely affect early embryonic development by disrupting the methylation of H19 and Peg3 through downregulation of DNMT1.",1.561,1644
25837375,The alternative role of DNA methylation in splicing regulation.,"['Lev Maor G', 'Yearim A', 'Ast G']",Trends in genetics : TIG,2015,"Although DNA methylation was originally thought to only affect transcription, emerging evidence shows that it also regulates alternative splicing. Exons, and especially splice sites, have higher levels of DNA methylation than flanking introns, and the splicing of about 22% of alternative exons is regulated by DNA methylation. Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons. These two mechanisms, however, regulate only a fraction of such events, implying that more underlying mechanisms remain to be found.",9.918,1069
27473283,DISMISS: detection of stranded methylation in MeDIP-Seq data.,"['Niazi U', 'Geyer KK', 'Vickers MJ', 'Hoffmann KF', 'Swain MT']",BMC bioinformatics,2016,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression and chromatin structure. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) is commonly used to identify regions of DNA methylation in eukaryotic genomes. Within MeDIP-Seq libraries, methylated cytosines can be found in both double-stranded (symmetric) and single-stranded (asymmetric) genomic contexts. While symmetric CG methylation has been relatively well-studied, asymmetric methylation in any dinucleotide context has received less attention. Importantly, no currently available software for processing MeDIP-Seq reads is able to resolve these strand-specific DNA methylation signals. Here we introduce DISMISS, a new software package that detects strand-associated DNA methylation from existing MeDIP-Seq analyses. RESULTS: Using MeDIP-Seq datasets derived from Apis mellifera (honeybee), an invertebrate species that contains more asymmetric- than symmetric- DNA methylation, we demonstrate that DISMISS can identify strand-specific DNA methylation signals with similar accuracy as bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq; single nucleotide resolution methodology). Specifically, DISMISS is able to confidently predict where DNA methylation predominates (plus or minus DNA strands - asymmetric DNA methylation; plus and minus DNA stands - symmetric DNA methylation) in MeDIP-Seq datasets derived from A. mellifera samples. When compared to DNA methylation data derived from BS-Seq analysis of A. mellifera worker larva, DISMISS-mediated identification of strand-specific methylated cytosines is 80 % accurate. Furthermore, DISMISS can correctly (p <0.0001) detect the origin (sense vs antisense DNA strands) of DNA methylation at splice site junctions in A. mellifera MeDIP-Seq datasets with a precision close to BS-Seq analysis. Finally, DISMISS-mediated identification of DNA methylation signals associated with upstream, exonic, intronic and downstream genomic loci from A. mellifera MeDIP-Seq datasets outperforms MACS2 (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq2; a commonly used MeDIP-Seq analysis software) and closely approaches the results achieved by BS-Seq. CONCLUSIONS: While asymmetric DNA methylation is increasingly being found in growing numbers of eukaryotic species and is the predominant pattern observed in some invertebrate genomes, it has been difficult to detect in MeDIP-Seq datasets using existing software. DISMISS now enables more sensitive examinations of MeDIP-Seq datasets and will be especially useful for the study of genomes containing either low levels of DNA methylation or for genomes containing relatively high amounts of asymmetric methylation.",2.576,522

Cell physiology,2015,"Cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the mechanisms responsible for endothelial apoptosis remain poorly understood. We conducted an in vitro study to investigate whether DNA methylation is involved in smoking-induced endothelial apoptosis. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) at a range of concentrations (0-10%). HUVECs were also incubated with a demethylating reagent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidinem (AZA), with and without CSE. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay and flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining. We found that CSE treatment significantly increased HUVEC apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot revealed that CSE treatment decreased cytochrome-c oxidase subunit II (COX II) mRNA and protein levels and decreased COX activity. Methylation-specific PCR and direct bisulfite sequencing revealed positive COX II gene methylation. AZA administration partly increased mRNA and protein expressions of COX II, and COX activity decreased by CSE and attenuated the toxic effects of CSE. Our results showed that CSE induced aberrant COX II methylation and apoptosis in HUVECs.",3.78,176

Patterns of methylation over multiple CpG sites in a region are often complex and cell type specific, with the region showing multiple allelic patterns in a sample.

True representation of methylation patterns can only be fully characterised by clonal analysis. Deep sequencing provides the ability to investigate clonal DNA methylation patterns in unprecedented detail and scale, enabling the proper characterisation of the heterogeneity of methylation patterns.

We evaluated 156 individuals (91 women, 65 men; age: 23.1+/-3.5 years; body mass index: 22.0+/-2.9 kg/m(2)) for anthropometric, biochemical and clinical markers, including some components of the antioxidant defense system and inflammatory response. DNA methylation of LINE-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 and the expression of some genes related to the inflammatory process were analyzed in WBC. Adiposity was lower among individuals with higher LINE-1 methylation. On the contrary, body fat-free mass was higher among those with higher LINE-1 methylation. Individuals with higher LINE-1 methylation had higher daily intakes of calories, iron and riboflavin. However, those individuals who presented lower percentages of LINE-1 methylation reported higher intakes of copper, niacin and thiamin. Interestingly, the group with higher LINE-1 methylation had a lower percentage of current smokers and more individuals practicing sports. On the other hand, TNF-alpha methylation percentage was negatively associated with waist girth, waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-stature ratio. Plasma TNF-alpha levels were lower in those individuals with higher TNF-alpha methylation. This study suggests that higher levels of LINE-1 and TNF-alpha methylation are associated with better indicators of adiposity status in healthy young individuals. In addition, energy and micronutrient intake, as well as a healthy lifestyle, may have a role in the regulation of DNA methylation in WBC and the subsequent metabolic changes may affect epigenetic biomarkers.",4.78,1745

However, its role in the regulation of gene expression during heart development is incompletely understood. The aim of this study is to reveal DNA methylation in mouse embryonic hearts and its role in regulating gene expression during heart development. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of mouse embryonic hearts using methyl-sensitive, tiny fragment enrichment/massively parallel sequencing to determine methylation levels at ACGT sites. The results showed that while global methylation of 1.64 million ACGT sites in developing hearts remains stable between embryonic day (E) 11.5 and E14.5, a small fraction (2901) of them exhibit differential methylation. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that these sites are enriched at genes involved in heart development. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of 350 genes with differential DNA methylation showed that the expression of 181 genes is developmentally regulated, and 79 genes have correlative changes between methylation and expression, including hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2). Required for heart valve formation, Has2 expression in the developing heart valves is downregulated at E14.5, accompanied with increased DNA methylation in its enhancer. Genetic knockout further showed that the downregulation of Has2 expression is dependent on DNA methyltransferase 3b, which is co-expressed with Has2 in the forming heart valve region, indicating that the DNA methylation change may contribute to the Has2 enhancer's regulating function. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation is developmentally regulated for genes essential to heart development, and abnormal DNA methylation may contribute to congenital heart disease.",4.306,1950

Despite the increase in the number of studies measuring markers of global methylation, few have adequately examined within-individual differences by source of DNA and whether within-individual differences by source of DNA differ by age, race and other lifestyle factors. We examined correlations between peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) and granulocyte DNA methylation levels measured by the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA), and in LINE-1, Sat2, and Alu by MethyLight and pyrosequencing, in the same individual in 112 women participating in The New York City Multiethnic Breast Cancer Project. Levels of DNA methylation of Sat2 by MethyLight (r = 0.57; P < 0.01) and LINE-1 by pyrosequencing (r = 0.30; P < 0.01) were correlated between PBMC and granulocyte DNA of the same individuals, but LUMA and Alu levels were not. The magnitude of the correlations for Sat2 and LINE-1 varied when stratified by selected demographic and lifestyle factors, although the study sample size limited our comparisons across subgroups. These results lend further support to the importance of considering the source of DNA in epidemiologic studies of white blood cell DNA methylation.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University-based fertility center. PATIENT(S): Participants were 127 men undergoing IVF treatment (where any major female factor cause of infertility had been ruled out), and 54 normozoospermic, fertile men. The IVF patients were stratified into 2 groups: patients who had generally good embryogenesis and a positive pregnancy (n = 55), and patients with generally poor embryogenesis (n = 72; 42 positive and 30 negative pregnancies) after IVF. INTERVENTION(S): Genomewide sperm DNA methylation analysis was performed to measure methylation at >485,000 sites across the genome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): A comparison was made of DNA methylation patterns of IVF patients vs. normozoospermic, fertile men. RESULT(S): Predictive models proved to be highly accurate in classifying male fertility status (fertile or infertile), with 82% sensitivity, and 99% positive predictive value. Hierarchic clustering identified clusters enriched for IVF patient samples and for poor-quality-embryo samples. Models built to identify samples within these groups, from neat samples, achieved positive predictive value >/= 94% while identifying >one fifth of all IVF patient and poor-quality-embryo samples in each case. Using density gradient prepared samples, the same approach recovered 46% of poor-quality-embryo samples with no false positives. CONCLUSION(S): Sperm DNA methylation patterns differ significantly and consistently for infertile vs. fertile, normozoospermic men.

This method combines selective capture of DNA target from restricted cleavage of genomic DNA using magnetic separation with MS detection of the nonenzymatic hydrolysates of target DNA. This method is shown to be highly sensitive with a detection limit as low as 0.056 amol, allowing direct profiling of methylation using genome DNA without preamplification. Moreover, this method offers a unique advantage in accurately determining DNA methylation level.

Subsequently, lentivirus-mediated RNA interference and overexpression were used to demonstrate that knocked-down of NEFL enhanced the invasion and migration of A549 and H460 NSCLC cells, whereas NEFL overexpression resulted in a suppression of the invasion and migration of GLC-82 and L78 cells in vitro. In addition, bisulfite sequence PCR assay demonstrated that NEFL downregulation was associated with promoter methylation, and NEFL expression was restored after treatment with 5-Aza-dC. Finally, we demonstrated that NEFL inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway, thereby suppressing the expression of uPA and decreasing NSCLC invasiveness and migration. Our studies suggest that NEFL methylation is a novel mechanism for NSCLC invasion and metastasis and that NEFL may represent a candidate biomarker for recurrence and survival in patients with NSCLC.",2.297,1181

There is increasing evidence for methylation profiling being able to delineate biologically relevant tumor groups even within the same cellular lineage. Therefore, we used DNA methylation arrays for methylome- and chromosomal profile-based characterization of 171 peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We analyzed 28 conventional high-grade MPNST, three malignant Triton tumors, six low-grade MPNST, four epithelioid MPNST, 33 neurofibromas (15 dermal, 8 intraneural, 10 plexiform), six atypical neurofibromas, 43 schwannomas (including 5 NF2 and 5 schwannomatosis associated cases), 11 cellular schwannomas, 10 melanotic schwannomas, 7 neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid tumors, 10 nerve sheath myxomas and 10 ganglioneuromas. Schwannomas formed different epigenomic subgroups including a vestibular schwannoma subgroup. Cellular schwannomas were not distinct from conventional schwannomas. Nerve sheath myxomas and neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid tumors were most similar to schwannomas. Dermal, intraneural and plexiform neurofibromas as well as ganglioneuromas all showed distinct methylation profiles. Atypical neurofibromas and low-grade MPNST were indistinguishable with a common methylation profile and frequent losses of CDKN2A. Epigenomic analysis finds two groups of conventional high-grade MPNST sharing a frequent loss of neurofibromin. The larger of the two groups shows an additional loss of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The smaller one retains H3K27me3 and is found in spinal locations. Sporadic MPNST with retained neurofibromin expression did not form an epigenetic group and most cases could be reclassified as cellular schwannomas or soft tissue sarcomas. Widespread immunohistochemical loss of H3K27me3 was exclusively seen in MPNST of the main methylation cluster, which defines it as an additional useful marker for the differentiation of cellular schwannoma and MPNST.",10.762,1680

In H3f3a(-/-) and H3f3b(-/-) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), H3.3 deficiency results in reduced levels of H3K9me3, H4K20me3 and ATRX at telomeres. The H3f3b(-/-) cells show increased levels of telomeric damage and sister chromatid exchange (t-SCE) activity when telomeres are compromised by treatment with a G-quadruplex (G4) DNA binding ligand or by ASF1 depletion. Overexpression of wild-type H3.3 (but not a H3.3K9 mutant) in H3f3b(-/-) cells increases H3K9 trimethylation level at telomeres and represses t-SCE activity induced by a G4 ligand.

To investigate the potential relationships between the risk of BC and the capacity to methylate iAs, a hospital-based case-control study (1016 cases/1028 controls) was performed in northern Mexico. Women were directly interviewed about their reproductive histories. The profile of As metabolites in urine was determined by HPLC-ICP-MS and methylation capacity was assessed by metabolite percentages and indexes. Total urinary As, excluding arsenobetaine (TAs-AsB), ranged from 0.26 to 303.29mug/L. Most women (86%) had TAs-AsB levels below As biological exposure index (35mug/L).

In addition, increased hnRNPK expression has been associated with tumor development and progression. A variety of post-translational modifications of hnRNPK have been identified and shown to regulate hnRNPK function, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and methylation. However, the functional significance of hnRNPK arginine methylation remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the methylation of two essential arginines, Arg296 and Arg299, on hnRNPK inhibited a nearby Ser302 phosphorylation that was mediated through the pro-apoptotic kinase PKCdelta. Notably, the engineered U2OS cells carrying an Arg296/Arg299 methylation-defective hnRNPK mutant exhibited increased apoptosis upon DNA damage. While such elevated apoptosis can be diminished through addition with wild-type hnRNPK, we further demonstrated that this increased apoptosis occurred through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and was p53 independent, at least in part. Here, we provide the first evidence that the arginine methylation of hnRNPK negatively regulates cell apoptosis through PKCdelta-mediated signaling during DNA damage, which is essential for the anti-apoptotic role of hnRNPK in apoptosis and the evasion of apoptosis in cancer cells.",9.112,806

The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between TAP1 gene promoter CpG island methylation status and mRNA expression in piglets. In this study, bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to detect the methylation status of the TAP1 gene promoter CpG islands and fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect TAP1 expression in the jejunum of Sutai piglets from birth to weaning age. The fragment of the TAP1 gene promoter region under investigation has no mutation, has 13 putative transcription factor binding sites containing 19 CpG sites, and may be important for regulation of gene expression. With increasing age, the overall methylation levels decreased, while the TAP1 expression levels increased, indicating a negative correlation between TAP1 expression and promoter methylation levels. Variance analysis showed significant differences in the methylation status of CpG_4, CpG_13 and CpG_15 among the different age groups (P<0.05).

Although triploidization has been applied successfully in many salmonid species, little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the maintenance of the normal functions of the new polyploid genome. By means of methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) techniques, genome-wide methylation changes associated with triploidization were assessed in DNA samples obtained from diploid and triploid siblings of brown trout (Salmo trutta). Simple comparative body measurements showed that the triploid trout used in the study were statistically bigger, however, not heavier than their diploid counterparts. The statistical analysis of the MSAP data showed no significant differences between diploid and triploid brown trout in respect to brain, gill, heart, liver, kidney or muscle samples. Nonetheless, local analysis pointed to the possibility of differences in connection with concrete loci.

Here we performed a longitudinal human pilot study in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing RIC by limb ischemia to compare changes in DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles before and after RIC. METHODS: Thirteen patients underwent 4 RIC sessions over 2 to 12 days after rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. We analyzed whole blood transcriptomes using RNA sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylomes using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, both before and after RIC. We tested differential expression and differential methylation using an intraindividual paired study design and then overlapped the differential expression and differential methylation results for analyses of functional categories and protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: We observed 164 differential expression genes and 3493 differential methylation CpG sites after RIC, of which 204 CpG sites overlapped with 103 genes, enriched for pathways of cell cycle (P<3.8x10(-4)) and inflammatory responses (P<1.4x10(-4)). The cell cycle pathway genes form a significant protein-protein interaction network of tightly coexpressed genes (P<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression and DNA methylation changes in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients undergoing RIC are involved in coordinated cell cycle and inflammatory responses.",0,320

We previously discovered over 3300 long non-coding (lnc)RNAs in human cells and demonstrated that specific lncRNAs regulate gene expression via interactions with chromatin-modifying complexes. Here, we tested whether lncRNAs could also associate with DNA methyltransferases to regulate DNA methylation and gene expression. Using RIP-seq, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that interact with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in a colon cancer cell line, HCT116. One lncRNA, TCONS_00023265, which we named DACOR1 (DNMT1-associated Colon Cancer Repressed lncRNA 1), shows high, tissue-specific expression in the normal colon (including colon crypts) but was repressed in a panel of colon tumors and patient-derived colon cancer cell lines. We identified the genomic occupancy sites of DACOR1, which we found to significantly overlap with known differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in colon tumors. Induction of DACOR1 in colon cancer cell lines significantly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro, suggesting a growth suppressor function. Consistent with the observed phenotype, induction of DACOR1 led to the activation of tumor-suppressor pathways and attenuation of cancer-associated metabolic pathways. Notably, DACOR1 induction resulted in down-regulation of Cystathionine beta-synthase, which is known to lead to increased levels of S-adenosyl methionine-the key methyl donor for DNA methylation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that deregulation of DNMT1-associated lncRNAs contributes to aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression during colon tumorigenesis.",6.393,1294

We examined the association between LINE1 %5mC and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk using pre-diagnostic blood DNA from the United States-based, Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (215 cases/436 controls), and the Alpha-tocopherol, Beta-carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC) of Finnish male smokers (191 cases/575 controls). Logistic regression adjusted for age at blood draw, study center, pack-years of smoking, body mass index, hypertension, dietary alcohol intake, family history of cancer, and sex was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using cohort and sex-specific methylation categories. In PLCO, higher, although non-significant, RCC risk was observed for participants at or above median methylation level (M2) compared to those below the median (M1) (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.96-1.95). The association was stronger in males (M2 vs. M1, OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.00-2.39) and statistically significant among male smokers (M2 vs. M1, OR: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.46-4.63). A significant interaction for smoking was also detected (P-interaction: 0.01). No association was found among females or female smokers.

27437217,Global DNA Methylation Level among Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Clinical Isolates of Escherichia coli.,"['Yugendran T', 'Harish BN']",Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,2016,"INTRODUCTION: Fluoroquinolone resistant clinical isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae is a major public health concern in India. Data analysis in JIPMER hospital revealed 10% rise in fluoroquinolone resistance within a span of three years suggestive of the possible involvement of mechanism/s other than QRDR capable of imparting fluoroquinolone resistance. DNA methylation regulates gene expression. Moreover, methylated cytosine is a mutational hotspot. Thus, DNA methylation can alter bacterial gene expression profile as well as facilitate the bacteria in accumulating mutations possibly leading to increased antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the present study was carried out to identify the potential involvement of DNA methylation in ciprofloxacin resistance. AIM: To elucidate and compare the methylation level of genomic and plasmid DNA among clinical isolates of E. coli sensitive and resistant to ciprofloxacin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 40 clinical E. coli isolates of which, 30 were ciprofloxacin-resistant and 10 were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Genomic DNA (gDNA) and plasmid DNA were extracted and quantified. Methylation levels were elucidated using 5-mC DNA ELISA kit (Zymoresearch, California, USA) as per kit protocol and guidelines. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Spearman correlation 2-tailed test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The MIC values of sensitive and resistant strains against ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.125 mug/mL - 0.75 mug/mL and 8 mug/mL - >256 mug/mL respectively. No difference was found in plasmid DNA methylation level but, the gDNA methylation level of the resistant strains significantly differed from that of the sensitive strains. Based on Spearman correlation test gDNA methylation level of bacteria was found to be inversely proportional to its MIC against ciprofloxacin with p= -0.956 (p-value < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The influence of DNA methylation over plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance needs to be further confirmed by bisulphite DNA sequencing of the plasmid-borne genes. Extensive usage of ciprofloxacin has led to rise in ciprofloxacin resistance possibly induced by DNA methylation. Thus rational usage of ciprofloxacin in a clinical setting is essential to combat the further development of ciprofloxacin resistance. Hypomethylated genes and adenine methylation needs to identified to fill up gaps in knowledge concerning the involvement of DNA methylation in fluoroquinolone resistance exhibited by E. coli.",1.212,712

In previous work, we reported genome-wide methylation differences in T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte populations from healthy individuals. Now, using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips to interrogate genome-wide DNA methylation, we have determined disease-associated methylation changes in blood-derived T- and B-lymphocyte populations from 12 female patients with seropositive established RA, relative to 12 matched healthy individuals. Array data were analyzed using NIMBL software and bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to validate array candidates. Genome-wide DNA methylation, determined by analysis of LINE-1 sequences, revealed higher methylation in B-lymphocytes compared with T-lymphocytes (P </= 0.01), which is consistent with our findings in healthy individuals. Moreover, loci-specific methylation differences that distinguished T-lymphocytes from B-lymphocytes in healthy individuals were also apparent in RA patients. However, disease-associated methylation differences were also identified in RA. In these cases, we identified 509 and 252 CpGs in RA-derived T- and B-lymphocytes, respectively, that showed significant changes in methylation compared with their cognate healthy counterparts. Moreover, this included a restricted set of 32 CpGs in T-lymphocytes and 20 CpGs in B-lymphocytes (representing 15 and 10 genes, respectively, and including two, MGMT and CCS, that were common to both cell types) that displayed more substantial changes in methylation. These changes, apparent as hyper- or hypo-methylation, were independently confirmed by pyrosequencing analysis. Validation by pyrosequencing also revealed additional sites in some candidate genes that also displayed altered methylation in RA. In this first study of genome-wide DNA methylation in individual T- and B-lymphocyte populations in RA patients, we report disease-associated methylation changes that are distinct to each cell type and which support a role for discrete epigenetic regulation in this disease.",4.78,1458

This cascade activates transcription of involucrin (hINV) and other genes associated with differentiation. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an arginine methyltransferase that symmetrically dimethylates arginine residues. This protein interacts with a cofactor, methylosome protein 50 (MEP50), and symmetrically dimethylates arginine eight of histone 3 (H3R8me2s) and arginine three of histone 4 (H4R3me2s) to silence gene expression. We use the hINV gene as a tool to understand the relationship between PKCdelta/p38delta and PRMT5/MEP50 signaling. MEP50 suppresses hINV mRNA level and promoter activity. This is associated with increased arginine dimethylation of hINV gene-associated H3/H4. We further show that the PKCdelta/p38delta keratinocyte differentiation cascade reduces PRMT5 and MEP50 expression, association with the hINV gene promoter, and H3R8me2s and H4R2me2s formation. We propose that PRMT5/MEP50-dependent methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that assists in silencing of hINV expression, and that PKCdelta signaling activates gene expression by directly activating transcription and by suppressing PRMT5/MEP50-dependent arginine dimethylation of promoter-associated histones. This is an example of crosstalk between PKCdelta/p38delta signaling and PRMT5/MEP50 epigenetic silencing.",0,1065

Efforts to address this include mutation analysis through whole genome sequencing and through DNA methylation studies. Methylation of DNA is affected by environmental factors; thus, as MZ twins age, their DNA methylation patterns change. This can be characterized by bisulfite treatment followed by pyrosequencing. However, this can be time-consuming and expensive; thus, it is unlikely to be widely used by investigators. If the sequences are different, then in theory the melting temperature should be different. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether high-resolution melt curve analysis can be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Five sets of MZ twins provided buccal swabs that underwent extraction, quantification, bisulfite treatment, polymerase chain reaction amplification and high-resolution melting curve analysis targeting two markers, Alu-E2F3 and Alu-SP. Significant differences were observed between all MZ twins targeting Alu-E2F3 and in four of five MZ twins targeting Alu-SP (P<0.05). Thus, it has been demonstrated that bisulfite treatment followed by high-resolution melting curve analysis could be used to differentiate between MZ twins.",2.219,1762

METHODS: This prospective study examined the methylation status of CDH13 in serum samples obtained from patients with primary prostate cancer and age-matched control subjects, using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Associations between methylation status of CDH13 and various clinicopathological features and patient survival were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients with prostate cancer and 47 control subjects were enrolled in the study. CDH13 promoter methylation was detected in 44 out of 98 (44.9%) patients with prostate cancer; no methylation was found in control subjects. Methylation of CDH13 was significantly associated with an increased Gleason score, an advanced tumour stage, and a high prostate-specific antigen level. CDH13 methylation was associated with a worse survival outcome and a relative risk of death of 6.132 (95% confidence interval: 3.160, 12.187). CONCLUSIONS: Promoter methylation of CDH13 occurred frequently in the serum of patients with prostate cancer, was associated with an increased risk of death, and may become a useful independent predictor of a poor prognosis.",0,1337

RESULTS: Methylated modification on the promoter sequences of cytokines and their receptors were found to be associated with MTB infection in a strain- and host-dependent manner. Our epigenetic analyses revealed that infection with Beijing/W MTB strains enhanced IL6R, IL4R and IL17R hyper-methylations in infected macrophages. Validation of IL6R methylated sequence confirmed that MTB infection induced DNA methylation of CpG67 region in the IL6R promoter. In addition, studies on the human macrophage methylation profiles from the patient cohorts indicated that the methylation rate of IL17 family members and related genes were significantly altered in patients with active MTB infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offered novel insights into the epigenetic changes in the interaction of host macrophages in MTB infections and warrant further explorations into these changes in modulating the immune response in active and latent MTB infections.",0,1134

METHODS: The promoter methylation status of ELF, RASSF1A, p16, and GSTP1 was investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 34 paired HCC and nontumor liver tissue from HCC patients and 10 tissues from patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Plasma samples from 31 HCC patients, 10 LC patients as well as 7 patients with benign hepatic conditions were also collected and characterized using the same method. RESULTS: Among liver specimens, HCC tissues displayed a significantly higher methylation frequency of each gene compared with nontumor tissue (p<0.05). Moreover, the frequency was much higher in tumor tissues than in nontumor tissue, when the data from two or three genes were combined (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Among plasma samples, either the frequency of at least one methylated gene (p<0.001) or the average number of methylated genes (p<0.05) demonstrated a stepwise increase in patients with benign lesions, LC, and HCC. Furthermore, when positive results, that is, plasma methylation status of at least one gene were combined with the elevated AFP400 level (serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] level at a cutoff of 400 ng/mL), the diagnostic sensitivity of HCC could increase to 93.55%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the methylation of tumor suppressor genes may participate in the development and progression of HCC. Additionally, it may be useful to combine the plasma DNA methylation status of a panel of gene markers and the serum AFP for HCC screening.",1.464,545

Sequences obtained from both environments clustered with those from the delta-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Methanomicrobia with significant overlap in hgcA phylogeny between libraries. Clear differences in hgcA distribution were observed between two highly contrasting sites within a tropical wetland in Everglades National Park, USA. hgcA sequences obtained from the northern site clustered primarily with those of methanogens, while sequences from the estuarine site clustered primarily with sulphate-reducing bacteria and syntrophs in the delta-Proteobacteria. Libraries obtained from soils collected from a temperate swamp in Sweden were dominated by hgcA sequences within the delta-Proteobacteria with hgcA sequences clustering primarily with iron reducers in the upstream portion of the swamp and with sulphate reducers in the downstream portion of the swamp. Interestingly, enrichments prepared from the lower portion of this temperate wetland contained a high abundance of hgcA sequences clustering with methanogens.

Inactivation of these genes can also be mediated by hypermethylation of CpGs in the promoter regions. Aim of this study was to analyse the clinical impact of BRCA1 promoter gene methylation status in a homogenous cohort of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. METHODS: The cohort included 257 primary HGSOC patients treated by cytoreduction and platinum-based chemotherapy. DNA was extracted from fresh frozen tissue samples. BRCA1 gene promoter methylation rate was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: 14.8% of patients presented hypermethylation within a selected region of the BRCA1 promoter. The rate of hypermethylation was significantly higher in younger patients (20.8% hypermethylation in the age group  58 years versus 8.7% hypermethylation in the age group >58 years; p = 0.008). Optimal tumour debulking could be reached in 63% of patients, without significant differences in the extent of residual disease with respect to the methylation status. No impact of BRCA1 gene promoter methylation status on progression free- and overall-survival rates was found. No significant differences within BRCA1 promoter methylation status between primary and metastatic tissue could be observed. These results on BRCA1 promoter methylation status were also confirmed in a subgroup of 107 patients found negative for BRCA1 exon 11 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that BRCA1 methylation determines the earlier onset of HGSOC. Furthermore our study supports the idea that BRCAness is not only due to mutations but also to epigenetic changes in BRCA1 promoter gene.",2.649,1579

The role of mRNA cap ribose 2'-O methylation is enigmatic, although recent work has implicated this as a signature to avoid detection of RNA by the innate immune system (S. Daffis, K. J. Szretter, J. Schriewer, J. Q. Li, S. Youn, J. Errett, T. Y. Lin, S. Schneller, R. Zust, H. P. Dong, V. Thiel, G. C. Sen, V. Fensterl, W. B. Klimstra, T. C. Pierson, R. M. Buller, M. Gale, P. Y. Shi, M. S. Diamond, Nature 468:452-456, 2010, doi:10.1038/nature09489). Working with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we previously showed that a panel of recombinant VSVs carrying mutations at a predicted methyltransferase catalytic site (rVSV-K1651A, -D1762A, and -E1833Q) or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site (rVSV-G1670A, -G1672A, and -G4A) were defective in cap methylation and were also attenuated for growth in cell culture. Here, we analyzed the virulence of these recombinants in mice. We found that rVSV-K1651A, -D1762A, and -E1833Q, which are defective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation, were highly attenuated in mice. All three viruses elicited a high level of neutralizing antibody and provided full protection against challenge with the virulent VSV. In contrast, mice inoculated with rVSV-G1670A and -G1672A, which are defective only in G-N-7 methylation, were attenuated in vivo yet retained a low level of virulence. rVSV-G4A, which is completely defective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation, also exhibited low virulence in mice despite the fact that productive viral replication was not detected in lung and brain. Taken together, our results suggest that abrogation of viral mRNA cap methylation can serve as an approach to attenuate VSV, and perhaps other nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, for potential application as vaccines and viral vectors. IMPORTANCE: Nonsegmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses include a wide range of significant human, animal, and plant pathogens. For many of these viruses, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available. mRNA cap methylation is essential for mRNA stability and efficient translation. Our current understanding of mRNA modifications of NNS RNA viruses comes largely from studies of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In this study, we showed that recombinant VSVs (rVSVs) defective in mRNA cap methylation were attenuated in vitro and in vivo. In addition, these methyltransferase (MTase)-defective rVSVs triggered high levels of antibody responses and provided complete protection against VSV infection. Thus, this study will not only contribute to our understanding of the role of mRNA cap MTase in viral pathogenesis but also facilitate the development of new live attenuated vaccines for VSV, and perhaps other NNS RNA viruses, by inhibiting viral mRNA cap methylation.",4.439,969

Recently it has been shown that subtelomeric methylation negatively regulates telomere length in various diseases, including cancers. Here, we evaluated the influence of subtelomeric methylation in telomere dysfunction in gallbladder cancer (GBC), and whether this dysfunction is affected by the presence of gallstones. METHODS: Relative telomere length and subtelomeric methylation levels were assessed using monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing, respectively, in different gallbladder tissue types including different grades of GBC, gallstones and adjacent non-tumor. RESULTS: We found telomere length to shorten significantly in overall GBC, but specifically in early grade cancer. We also found D4Z4 and DNF92 subtelomeric sequences to be hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively, in GBC; however, their methylation levels differed significantly, only in early grade cancer. We could not find any specific correlation between subtelomeric methylation and telomere length in GBC. Interestingly, telomere length and subtelomeric methylation differed significantly in GBC without gallstones but not in GBC with gallstones. CONCLUSIONS: This study, thus, suggests that telomere dysfunction and changes in methylation levels may occur earlier in the progression of GBC, while the presence of gallstones may have no influence on telomere length as well as on methylation levels.",2.994,691

The clinical spectra range from very aggressive metastatic disease to spontaneous regression, even without therapy. Aberrant DNA methylation pattern is a common feature of most cancers. For neuroblastoma, it has been demonstrated both for single genes as well as genome-wide, where a so-called methylator phenotype has been described. Here, we present a study using Illumina 450K methylation arrays on 60 neuroblastoma tumors. We show that aggressive tumors, characterized by International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) as stage M, are hypermethylated compared to low-grade tumors. On the contrary, INRG stage L tumors display more non-CpG methylation. The genes with the highest number of hypermethylated CpG sites in INRG M tumors are TERT, PCDHGA4, DLX5, and DLX6-AS1. Gene ontology analysis showed a representation of neuronal tumor relevant gene functions among the differentially methylated genes. For validation, we used a set of independent tumors previously analyzed with the Illumina 27K methylation arrays, which confirmed the differentially methylated sites. Top candidate genes with aberrant methylation were analyzed for altered gene expression through the R2 platform ( http://r2.amc.nl), and for correlations between methylation and gene expression in a public dataset. Altered expression in nonsurvivors was found for the genes B3GALT4 and KIAA1949, CLIC5, DLX6-AS, TERT, and PIRT, and strongest correlations were found for TRIM36, KIAA0513, and PIRT.

Validated biological markers for disease prognosis available at diagnosis are lacking. No genome-wide DNA methylation studies linked to clinical outcomes have been reported in osteosarcoma to the best of our knowledge. To address this, we tested the methylome at over 1.1 million loci in 15 osteosarcoma biopsy samples obtained prior to the initiation of therapy and correlated these molecular data with disease outcomes. At more than 17% of the tested loci, samples obtained from patients who experienced disease relapse were more methylated than those from patients who did not have recurrence while patients who did not experience disease relapse had more DNA methylation at fewer than 1%. In samples from patients who went on to have recurrent disease, increased DNA methylation was found at gene bodies, intergenic regions and empirically-annotated candidate enhancers, whereas candidate gene promoters were unusual for a more balanced distribution of increased and decreased DNA methylation with 6.6% of gene promoter loci being more methylated and 2% of promoter loci being less methylated in patients with disease relapse. A locus at the TLR4 gene demonstrates one of strongest associations between DNA methylation and 5 y event-free survival (P-value = 1.7 x 10(-6)), with empirical annotation of this locus showing promoter characteristics.

Recently, we discovered numerous novel genes that were aberrantly methylated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array. We utilized a quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) system for the evaluation of PAX6 methylation in 29 normal controls and 160 paired HCC tissues and their adjacent non-tumor tissues. We verified the correlation between the methylation status of PAX6 and clinical characteristics with different viral status. RESULTS: Paired-box 6 promoter methylation was observed in 39.4 %, 15.6 %, and 3.4 % in primary HCCs, adjacent non-tumors, and normal control tissues, respectively. Methylation of the PAX6 promoter region in HCCs significantly increased compared with control tissues. PAX6 was frequently methylated in HCV-positive HCC tissues (61.3 %) and rarely methylated in HBV-positive (22.1 %) and double-negative HCC tissues (33.3 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that promoter hypermethylation of PAX6 is a common event in HCCs and the association of PAX6 methylation in clinicopathological features is divergent with different viral status.",4.543,1253

Research suggests that there may be different developmental pathways to CU (genetic/constitutional vs environmental), and that the absence or presence of co-occurring internalizing problems is a key marker. However, it is unclear whether such a distinction is valid. Intermediate phenotypes such as DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification regulating gene expression, may help to clarify etiological pathways. This is the first study to examine prospective inter-relationships between environmental risk (prenatal/postnatal) and DNA methylation (birth, age 7 and 9) in the prediction of CU (age 13), for youth low vs high in internalizing problems. We focused on DNA methylation in the vicinity of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene as it has been previously implicated in CU. Participants were 84 youth with early-onset and persistent conduct problems drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. For youth with low internalizing problems (46%), we found that (i) OXTR methylation at birth associated with higher CU (age 13) as well as decreased experience of victimization during childhood (evocative epigenetic-environment correlation; birth-age 7), (ii) higher prenatal parental risks (maternal psychopathology, criminal behaviors, substance use) associated with higher OXTR methylation at birth and (iii) OXTR methylation levels were more stable across time (birth-age 9). In contrast, for youth with high internalizing problems, CU were associated with prenatal risks of an interpersonal nature (that is, intimate partner violence, family conflict) but not OXTR methylation. Findings support the existence of distinct developmental pathways to CU.",14.496,1714

To explain its origin and evolution, mainly three mechanisms have been proposed: selection for GC content, mutation bias, and GC-biased gene conversion. At present, the mechanism of GC-biased gene conversion, i.e., short-scale, unidirectional exchanges between homologous chromosomes in the neighborhood of recombination-initiating double-strand breaks in favor for GC nucleotides, is the most widely accepted hypothesis. We here suggest that DNA methylation also plays an important role in the evolution of GC content in vertebrate genomes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated one mammalian (human) and one avian (chicken) genome. We used bisulfite sequencing to generate a whole-genome methylation map of chicken sperm and made use of a publicly available whole-genome methylation map of human sperm. Inclusion of these methylation maps into a model of GC content evolution provided significant support for the impact of DNA methylation on the local equilibrium GC content. Moreover, two different estimates of equilibrium GC content, one that neglects and one that incorporates the impact of DNA methylation and the concomitant CpG hypermutability, give estimates that differ by approximately 15% in both genomes, arguing for a strong impact of DNA methylation on the evolution of GC content. Thus, our results put forward that previous estimates of equilibrium GC content, which neglect the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides, need to be reevaluated.",0,787

However, its function and regulation mechanisms in gastric cancer have not yet been investigated. Here, we showed the low expression of ArgBP2 mRNA level in gastric tumor samples and its repressive function in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Then, we cloned and identified ArgBP2 promoter and verified that MORC2 bound to the promoter. Moreover, we demonstrated that MORC2 enhanced the recruitment of EZH2, which promoted the tri-methylation of H3K27, leading to the transcriptional repression of ArgBP2. Our results might thus contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of ArgBP2 regulation and suggesting ArgBP2 as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.",2.297,388

Our objective was to examine DNA methylation patterns of 4 ASD candidate genes in human fetal membranes from spontaneous PTB and uncomplicated term birth. STUDY DESIGN: A literature search for genes that have been implicated in ASD yielded 14 candidate genes (OXTR, SHANK3, BCL2, RORA, EN2, RELN, MECP2, AUTS2, NLGN3, NRXN1, SLC6A4, UBE3A, GABA, AFF2) that were epigenetically modified in relation to ASD. DNA methylation in fetal leukocyte DNA in 4 of these genes (OXTR, SHANK3, BCL2, and RORA) was associated with PTB in a previous study. This study evaluated DNA methylation, transcription (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), and translation patterns (immunostaining and Western blot) in fetal membrane from term labor (n = 14), term not in labor (TNIL; n = 29), and spontaneous preterm birth (PTB; n = 27). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance; a probability value of < .05 was significant. RESULTS: Higher methylation of the OXTR promoter was seen in fetal membranes from PTB, compared with term labor or TNIL. No other gene showed any methylation differences among groups. Expression of OXTR was not different among groups, but the 70 kDa OXTR protein was seen only in PTB, and immunostaining was more intense in PTB amniocytes than term labor or TNIL. CONCLUSION: Among the 4 genes that were studied, fetal membranes from PTB demonstrate differences in OXTR methylation and regulation and expression, which suggest that epigenetic alteration of this gene in fetal membrane may likely be indicating an in utero programing of this gene and serve as a surrogate in a subset of PTB. The usefulness of OXTR hypermethylation as a surrogate for a link to ASD should be further evaluated in longitudinal and in vitro studies.",4.704,1102

Here we try to clarify whether and how miR-9 takes part in the regulation of paclitaxel sensitivity. METHODS: miR-9 expressions in EOC cells and tissues were detected by Realtime PCR. The target of miR-9 was validated through dual luciferase reporter assay and Western Blot. Methylation study, RNAi technique and cytotoxicity assay were used to determine the intrinsic mechanism of miR-9 in paclitaxel sensitivity regulation. RESULTS: miR-9 is down-regulated in paclitaxel resistant EOC. The patients with lower miR-9, Grade 3, Stage III -IV and suboptimal surgery present shorter survival time. miR-9 and suboptimal surgery are independent prognostic factors of EOC. Modulating miR-9 expression could change paclitaxel sensitivity of EOC cells. CCNG1, validated as a direct target of miR-9, mediates paclitaxel resistance. miR-9-1 and 3 gene hypermethylation would decrease miR-9 expression, while demethylation of miR-9 gene could restore miR-9 expression and improve paclitaxel sensitivity in chemoresistance EOC cells. Furthermore, methylation-associated miR-9 deregulation in EOC cells could be induced by paclitaxel exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation-associated miR-9 down-regulation is probably one of the key mechanisms for paclitaxel resistance in EOC cells, via targeting CCNG1. Our findings may also provide a new potential therapeutic target to reverse paclitaxel resistance in EOC patients.",3.362,262

We conducted a critical review to summarize the evidence regarding aberrant DNA methylation patterns as a potential diagnostic biomarker predicting progression. We identified all relevant human studies published in English prior to 30th April 2015 that examined DNA methylation (%) in oral pre-cancer by searching PubMed, Web-of-Science and Embase databases using combined key-searches. Twenty-one studies (18-cross-sectional; 3-longitudinal) were eligible for inclusion in the review, with sample sizes ranging from 4 to 156 affected cases. Eligible studies examined promoter region hyper-methylation of tumour suppressor genes in pathways including cell-cycle-control (n=15), DNA-repair (n=7), cell-cycle-signalling (n=4) and apoptosis (n=3). Hyper-methylated loci reported in three or more studies included p16, p14, MGMT and DAPK. Two longitudinal studies reported greater p16 hyper-methylation in pre-cancerous lesions transformed to malignancy compared to lesions that regressed (57-63.6% versus 8-32.1%; p<0.01). The one study that explored epigenome-wide methylation patterns reported three novel hyper-methylated loci (TRHDE; ZNF454; KCNAB3). The majority of reviewed studies were small, cross-sectional studies with poorly defined control groups and lacking validation. Whilst limitations in sample size and study design preclude definitive conclusions, current evidence suggests a potential utility of DNA methylation patterns as a diagnostic biomarker for oral pre-cancer progression. Robust studies such as large epigenome-wide methylation explorations of oral pre-cancer with longitudinal tracking are needed to validate the currently reported signals and identify new risk-loci and the biological pathways of disease progression.",3.607,1086

We sought to identify novel regions of variable DNA methylation associated with newborn attention, lethargy, quality of movement, and arousal by performing an epigenome-wide association study in 335 infants from a US birth cohort. Methylation status was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and associations to newborn outcomes assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) were identified while incorporating established bioinformatics algorithms to control for confounding by cell type composition. Methylation of CpGs within FHIT (cg15970800) and ANKRD11 (cg16710656) demonstrated genome-wide significance (P < 1.8 x 10(-7)) in specific associations with infant attention. CpGs whose differential methylation was associated with all 4 neurobehavioral outcomes were common to 50 genes involved in biological processes relating to cellular adhesion and nervous system development. Comprehensive methylation profiling identified relationships between methylation of FHIT and ANKRD11, which have been previously linked to neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in genetic association studies. Subtle changes in DNA methylation of these genes within the placenta may impact normal variation of a newborn's ability to alter and track visual and auditory stimuli. Gene ontology analysis suggested that those genes with variable methylation related to these outcomes are over-represented in biological pathways involved in brain development and placental physiology, supportive of our hypothesis for a key role of the placenta in neurobehavioral outcomes.",4.78,472

The scarcity of reliable PPGL prognostic markers continues to complicate patient management. In this study, we explored genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the context of PPGL malignancy to identify novel prognostic markers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively investigated DNA methylation patterns in PPGL with and without metastases using high-throughput DNA methylation profiling data (Illumina 27K) from two large, well-characterized discovery (n = 123; 24 metastatic) and primary validation (n = 154; 24 metastatic) series. Additional validation of candidate CpGs was performed by bisulfite pyrosequencing in a second independent set of 33 paraffin-embedded PPGLs (19 metastatic). RESULTS: Of the initial 86 candidate CpGs, we successfully replicated 52 (47 genes), associated with metastatic PPGL. Of these, 48 CpGs showed significant associations with time to progression even after correcting for SDHB genotype, suggesting their value as prognostic markers independent of genetic background. Hypermethylation of RDBP (negative elongation factor complex member E) in metastatic tumors was further validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing [Deltabetametastatic-benign = 0.29, P = 0.003; HR, 1.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.0; P = 0.018] and may alter transcriptional networks involving (RERG, GPX3, and PDZK1) apoptosis, invasion, and maintenance of DNA integrity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale study of DNA methylation in metastatic PPGL that identifies and validates prognostic markers, which could be used for stratifying patients according to risk of developing metastasis. Of the three CpGs selected for further validation, one (RDBP) was clearly confirmed and could be used for stratifying patients according to the risk of developing metastases.",8.722,1937

One of the major models for studying cytosine demethylation is the mammalian germ line during the primordial germ cell (PGC) stage of embryo development. It is now understood that oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is required to remove cytosine methylation in a locus-specific manner in PGCs; however, the mechanisms downstream of 5hmC are controversial and hypothesized to involve either active demethylation or replication-coupled loss. In the current study, we used the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) organ culture model to show that this model recapitulates germ line reprogramming, including 5hmC reorganization and loss of cytosine methylation from Snrpn and H19 imprinting control centers (ICCs). To directly address the hypothesis that cell proliferation is required for cytosine demethylation, we blocked PI3-kinase-dependent PGC proliferation and show that this leads to a G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in PGCs, together with retained levels of cytosine methylation at the Snrpn ICC, but not at the H19 ICC. Taken together, the AGM organ culture model is an important tool to evaluate mechanisms of locus-specific demethylation and the role of PI3-kinase-dependent PGC proliferation in the locus-specific removal of cytosine methylation from the genome.",3.727,1193

The activity of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic telomerase subunit, correlates with telomerase activity in tumors. The objective of this study was to investigate TERT promoter methylation and its prognostic impact in gastric cancer (GC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis of TERT promoter methylation was performed in tumors and corresponding normal tissues of 116 patients with GC using a highly sensitive Sequenom Epityper assay. The expression of TERT in GC tissues was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The levels of TERT promoter methylation in GC samples were significantly higher than in normal adjacent tissues (P=0.002). Hypermethylation of TERT promoter was associated with high T-stage (P=0.024), late N-stage (P=0.006), and lymphovascular/neural invasion (P=0.035), without correlation with age, sex, or histological grade. Simple linear regression analysis showed that TERT mRNA correlated positively with TERT methylation (R (2)=0.562, P=0.001). Also, higher TERT mRNA expression was related to hypermethylation of TERT promoter in GC samples (P=0.005). Univariate analysis demonstrated that N-stage (P=0.002) and TERT promoter methylation (P=0.004) were predictive of overall survival. Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed that N-stage (P=0.013) and TERT promoter methylation (P=0.031) were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival.

Reduced KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 gene expression might lead to a loss of inhibitory M-current and an increase in neuronal hyperexcitability in disease. The goal of the present study was to evaluate epigenetic and gene expression associations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes with BPD. METHODS: DNA methylation and gene expression levels of alternative transcripts of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 capable of binding the ankyrin G (ANK3) gene were evaluated using bisulfite pyrosequencing and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the postmortem prefrontal cortex of subjects with BPD and matched controls from the McLean Hospital. Replication analyses of DNA methylation findings were performed using prefrontal cortical DNA obtained from the Stanley Medical Research Institute. RESULTS: Significantly lower expression was observed in KCNQ3, but not KCNQ2. DNA methylation analysis of CpGs within an alternative exonic region of KCNQ3 exon 11 demonstrated significantly lower methylation in BPD, and correlated significantly with KCNQ3 mRNA levels. Lower KCNQ3 exon 11 DNA methylation was observed in the Stanley Medical Research Institute replication cohort, although only after correcting for mood stabilizer status. Mood stabilizer treatment in rats resulted in a slight DNA methylation increase at the syntenic KCNQ3 exon 11 region, which subsequent analyses suggested could be the result of alterations in neuronal proportion. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that epigenetic alterations in the KCNQ3 gene may be important in the etiopathogenesis of BPD and highlight the importance of controlling for medication and cellular composition-induced heterogeneity in psychiatric studies of the brain.",4.965,576

Alternative splicing regulation of a subset of these exons can be explained by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which silences or enhances exon recognition in a position-dependent manner. We constructed an experimental system using site-specific targeting of a methylated/unmethylated gene and demonstrate a direct causal relationship between DNA methylation and alternative splicing.

To present, proposed virulence genotypes are also detected in isolates from asymptomatic carriers, indicating more complex mechanisms underlying variable colonization modes of N. meningitidis. We applied the Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing method from Pacific Biosciences to assess the genome-wide DNA modification profiles of two genetically related N. meningitidis strains, both of serogroup A. The resulting DNA methylomes revealed clear divergences, represented by the detection of shared and of strain-specific DNA methylation target motifs. The positional distribution of these methylated target sites within the genomic sequences displayed clear biases, which suggest a functional role of DNA methylation related to the regulation of genes. DNA methylation in N. meningitidis has a likely underestimated potential for variability, as evidenced by a careful analysis of the ORF status of a panel of confirmed and predicted DNA methyltransferase genes in an extended collection of N. meningitidis strains of serogroup A. Based on high coverage short sequence reads, we find phase variability as a major contributor to the variability in DNA methylation. Taking into account the phase variable loci, the inferred functional status of DNA methyltransferase genes matched the observed methylation profiles. Towards an elucidation of presently incompletely characterized functional consequences of DNA methylation in N. meningitidis, we reveal a prominent colocalization of methylated bases with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) detected within our genomic sequence collection. As a novel observation we report increased mutability also at 6mA methylated nucleotides, complementing mutational hotspots previously described at 5mC methylated nucleotides.

We demonstrate that the 45S particle that accumulates in DeltarlmE is a genuine precursor that can be assembled into the 50S subunit. Indeed, 50S formation from the 45S precursor could be promoted by RlmE-mediated Um2552 formation in vitro. Ribosomal protein L36 (encoded by rpmJ) was completely absent from the 45S precursor in DeltarlmE, and we observed a strong genetic interaction between rlmE and rpmJ. Structural probing of 23S rRNA and high-salt stripping of 45S components revealed that RlmE-mediated methylation promotes interdomain interactions via the association between helices 92 and 71, stabilized by the single 2'-O-methylation of Um2552, in concert with the incorporation of L36, triggering late steps of 50S subunit assembly.",9.674,1030

However, patients have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus 1 is caused by overexpression of the maternally imprinted genes PLAGL1 and HYMAI on chromosome 6q24. One of the mechanisms leading to overexpression of the locus is hypomethylation of the maternal allele of PLAGL1 and HYMAI. A subset of patients with maternal hypomethylation at PLAGL1 have hypomethylation at additional imprinted loci throughout the genome, including GRB10, ZIM2 (PEG3), MEST (PEG1), KCNQ1OT1 and NESPAS (GNAS-AS1). About half of the TNDM1 patients carry mutations in ZFP57, a transcription factor involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation of imprinted loci. Our objective was to investigate whether additional regions are aberrantly methylated in ZFP57 mutation carriers. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on four individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous ZFP57 mutations, three relatives with heterozygous ZFP57 mutations and five controls. Methylation status of selected regions showing aberrant methylation in the patients was verified using bisulfite-sequencing. RESULTS: We found large variability among the patients concerning the number and identity of the differentially methylated regions, but more than 60 regions were aberrantly methylated in two or more patients and a novel region within PPP1R13L was found to be hypomethylated in all the patients. The hypomethylated regions in common between the patients are enriched for the ZFP57 DNA binding motif. CONCLUSIONS: We have expanded the epimutational spectrum of TNDM1 associated with ZFP57 mutations and found one novel region within PPP1R13L which is hypomethylated in all TNDM1 patients included in this study.

This study aims to detect the promoter methylation status and the mRNA expression levels of ATG2B, ATG4D, ATG9A and ATG9B, and then to explore their relationship in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) and matched normal tissues (MNTs) of the breast. Methylation was observed as follows: 61.0% in ATG2B, 46.8% in ATG4D, 56.4% in ATG9A, and 74.0% in ATG9B of IDCs. Meanwhile, their mRNA expression levels of the IDCs was lower than that of the MNTs (P<0.001, P=0.019, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Methylated IDCs of ATG2B, ATG9A, ATG9B and unmethylated ATG4D, ATG9B showed significantly lower expression values compared to the MNTs (P=0.003, P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.014 and P=0.002, respectively). The methylations of ATG2B and ATG9B were related to their lower expression levels in IDCs (P=0.017 and P=0.023). Moreover, ATG2B methylation was positively associated with the grade (P=0.024) and TNM stage (P=0.015); Methylation of ATG4D and ATG9A was positively correlated to lymph node involvement (P=0.012 and P=0.018), while methylation of ATG9B appeared susceptible to CK5/6 positive status and deteriorated TNM stages (P=0.003 and P=0.012). Moreover, the decreased expression of ATG2B was related to the ER and PR status (P=0.004 and P=0.003). The ER, HER-2 and lymph node metastasis status are the determinants to reducing the expression of ATG4D, ATG9A and ATG9B (P=0.026, P=0.010 and P=0.011, respectively).

In addition, social stressors cause plastic molecular changes in the brain that underlie unique behavioral phenotypes that also modulate fitness. In the adult African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni, growth and social status of males are both directly regulated by social interactions in a dynamic social environment, which causes a suite of plastic changes in circuits, cells and gene transcription in the brain. We hypothesized that a possible mechanism underlying some molecular changes might be DNA methylation, a reversible modification made to cytosine nucleotides that is known to regulate gene function. Here we asked whether changes in DNA methylation of the GnRH1 gene, the central regulator of the reproductive axis, were altered during development of A. burtoni. We measured changes in methylation state of the GnRH1 gene during normal development and following the gestational and developmental stress of social crowding. We found differential DNA methylation within developing juveniles between 14-, 28- and 42-day-old. Following gestational crowding of mouth brooding mothers, we saw differential methylation and transcription of GnRH1 in their offspring. Taken together, our data provides evidence for social control of GnRH1 developmental responses to gestational cues through DNA methylation.",3.234,1646

However, no data on the possible association between a higher methylation of this gene and clinical severity is available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between NR3C1 methylation status, the history of childhood trauma, and current clinical severity in subjects with BPD. A sample of 281 subjects with BPD (diagnosed by SCID-II and DIB-R semi-structured diagnostic interviews) was recruited. Clinical variables included previous hospitalizations, self-injurious behavior, and self-reported history of childhood trauma. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. The results indicated a significant positive correlation between NR3C1 methylation status and childhood maltreatment (specifically physical abuse). In addition, a positive correlation between methylation status and clinical severity (DIB-R total score and hospitalizations) was observed.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary lipid sources [various fatty acids (FAs)] modify mtDNA methylation. METHODS: A total of 600 large yellow croakers (Larimichthys crocea) with an average initial weight of 151 +/- 4 g were fed 1 of 5 diets (3 replicate cages/treatment) containing either fish oil (FO) (control), palmitic acid, olive oil (OO), sunflower oil, or perilla oil (PO) as the dietary lipid source (12% dry weight of the diet) for 70 d. Pyrosequencing was used to determine the effects of dietary lipid sources (FAs) on mtDNA methylation. RESULTS: Mitochondrial arginine transfer RNA and NAD(H) dehydrogenase 4L encoding region methylation in the liver was higher in the OO (9.5% +/- 0.52%; P < 0.05) and PO (7.3% +/- 0.33%; P < 0.05) groups than in the FO (5.9% +/- 0.42%) group, whereas 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation in the liver was lower in the OO group (2.7% +/- 0.22%) than in the FO group (4.2% +/- 0.73%) (P < 0.05). Additionally, fish fed the OO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of ND3 (P < 0.05), ND4L (P < 0.05), ND6 (P < 0.05), 12S rRNA (P < 0.05), and 16S rRNA (P < 0.05) than those fed the FO diet, whereas fish fed the PO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of 16S rRNA than those fed the FO diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, fish fed the OO (P < 0.05) or PO (P < 0.05) diet had lower liver mitochondrial complex I activity than did those fed the FO diet. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that dietary lipid sources influence mitochondrial function through mtDNA methylation in large yellow croakers.",0,127

FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and alters its ability to respond to stress signaling. The aim of the present study was to examine methylation of the FKBP5 gene (FKBP5), and the role of an FKBP5 genetic variant, in relation to childhood maltreatment in a sample of impoverished preschool-aged children. One hundred seventy-four families participated in this study, including 69 with child welfare documentation of moderate to severe maltreatment in the past 6 months. The children, who ranged in age from 3 to 5 years, were racially and ethnically diverse. Structured record review and interviews in the home were used to assess a history of maltreatment, other traumas, and contextual life stressors; and a composite variable assessed the number exposures to these adversities. Methylation of two sites in intron 7 of FKBP5 was measured via sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing. Maltreated children had significantly lower levels of methylation at both CpG sites (p < .05). Lifetime contextual stress exposure showed a trend for lower levels of methylation at one of the sites, and a trend for an interaction with the FKBP5 polymorphism. A composite adversity variable was associated with lower levels of methylation at one of the sites as well (p < .05). FKBP5 alters glucocorticoid receptor responsiveness, and FKBP5 gene methylation may be a mechanism of the biobehavioral effects of adverse exposures in young children.",3.24,344

The aim of the present study was to investigate the methylation status of PCDH17 in ccRCC and its potential relevance to clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR was used to examine the methylation status of PCDH17 in 191 ccRCC tumors and matched paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Subsequently, the associations between PCDH17 methylation and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of patients with ccRCC were analyzed. RESULTS: PCDH17 methylation occurred in 66.5% of ccRCC tumors, but in only 12.1% of adjacent noncancerous tissues. PCDH17 methylation is significantly correlated with advanced stage, higher grade, and lymph node metastasis in ccRCC. Moreover, it is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with ccRCC. CONCLUSIONS: PCDH17 methylation occurred more frequently and was associated with malignant clinicopathological characteristics and poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. Thus, PCDH17 methylation may be used as a novel biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with ccRCC.",1.433,316

METHODS: HPV16 physical status, methylation of its early-late promoters and its upstream enhancer sequences were analysed in samples from asymptomatic cervical infections (n=89), pre-neoplastic lesions (low and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions LSIL/HSIL, n=28) and primary CaCx (n=98). RESULTS: In asymptomatic infection (65%, 58/89) and LSIL/HSIL (57%, 16/28) samples, the episomal form of HPV16 was predominant whereas integration of HPV16 was significantly (p=0.01) higher in CaCx (59%, 57/98). The integrated viral form was also present in asymptomatic (27%, 24/89) and LSIL/HSIL (25%, 7/28) samples. The methylation of the enhancer region was comparable (29-34%) among asymptomatic, LSIL/HSIL and CaCx samples. The episomal form exhibited relatively higher methylation of the early promoter (52%) than that of the late promoter (40%) in asymptomatic infection but the integrated form in asymptomatic carriers showed the opposite methylation pattern (early promoter (42%) vs late-promoter (54%)). A similar pattern was observed in LSIL/HSIL samples, with comparable frequencies (44%) of early and late promoter methylation of the episomal form. However, irrespective of HPV16 physical status, higher methylation of late promoter than that of early promoter was observed in CaCx samples. An inverse correlation was observed between HPV16 integration and overall methylation of the early promoter-enhancer region in CaCx (p=0.05), LSIL/HSIL (p=0.09) and asymptomatic samples (p=0.09).

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of fetal troponin I gene (also called slow skeletal troponin I, ssTnI) is predominated in the fetal stage, reduced after birth and disappeared in the adulthood. The mechanism underlying the developmentally related ssTnI gene regulation is not clear. In this study, we have explored the epigenetic role of DNA methylation in the regulation of ssTnI expression in the heart during the development. RESULTS: The DNA methylation levels of CpG island and CpG dinucleotides region were detected using methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequence PCR (BSP) in 2000 bp upstream and 100 bp upstream of ssTnI gene promoter. Real time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect ssTnI mRNA and protein expression levels. We found that DNA methylation levels of the CpG dinucleotides region in ssTnI gene promoter were increased with the development, corresponding to a decreased expression of ssTnI gene in mouse heart. However the DNA methylation levels of CpG islands in this gene were not changed during the development. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 5-Azacytidine, in cultured myocardial cells partially prevented the decline of ssTnI expression. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that DNA methylation, as an epigenetic intervention, plays a role in the regulation of the fetal TnI gene expression in the heat during the development.",2.763,270

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 71 EC tissues from resection and 35 adjacent normal tissues were collected. Methylation status in the promoter region was detected by methylation- and non-methylation-specific primers. Corresponding mRNA levels were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Correlations between the methylations of these 3 genes and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to investigate the relationships between WIF-1, RASSF1A, and CDH13 promoter methylations and the prognosis of EC. RESULTS Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the methylation frequencies of WIF-1, RASSF1A, and CDH13 genes were significantly higher but the mRNA levels of these 3 genes were significantly lower in EC tissues (all P<0.05). WIF-1 and CDH13 promoter methylations were associated with the degree of tumor differentiation and WIF-1 and RASSF1A promoter methylations were associated with age (all P<0.05). The survival rates of patients with WIF-1, RASSF1A, and CDH13 methylations were significantly lower than those of patients without methylation (all P<0.05).

24257323,Maternal micronutrients and brain global methylation patterns in the offspring.,[],Nutritional neuroscience,2015,"OBJECTIVES: Studies have established the association of maternal nutrition and increased risk for non-communicable diseases. It has been suggested that this involves epigenetic modifications in the genome. However, the role of maternal micronutrients in the one-carbon cycle in influencing brain development of the offspring through methylation is unexplored. It is also unclear whether epigenomic marks established during early development can be reversed by a postnatal diet. The present study reports the effect of maternal micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids on global DNA methylation patterns in the brain of the Wistar rat offspring at three timepoints (at birth, postnatal day 21, and 3 months of age). METHOD: Pregnant rats were divided into control (n = 8) and five treatment groups (n = 16 dams in each group) at two levels of folic acid (normal and excess folate) in the presence and absence of vitamin B12 (NFBD, EFB, and EFBD). Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was given to vitamin B12 deficient groups (NFBDO and EFBDO). Following delivery, eight dams from each group were shifted to control diet and remaining continued on the same treatment diet. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that maternal micronutrient imbalance results in global hypomethylation in the offspring brain at birth. At adult age the cortex of the offspring displayed hypermethylation as compared with control, in spite of a postnatal control diet. In contrast, prenatal omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was able to normalize methylation at 3 months of age. DISCUSSION: Our findings provide clues for the role of omega-3 fatty acids in reversing methylation patterns thereby highlighting its contribution in neuroprotection and cognition.",2.274,1733

The effectiveness of differential methylation patterns of DAPK gene for diagnosis of leukemia was verified in the leukemia cell lines and peripheral blood samples by methylation specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: The methylation pattern of DAPK gene in different cell genomes displayed that the degree of unmethylation in normal cell genome was higher than that of leukemia cell lines. The differential CpG sites were found and could be used to differentiate HL-60 and the other 3 cell lines by MSP. Meanwhile, the differential methylation patterns in clinical specimens could distinguish acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and other types of leukemia by MSP. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 59.1%, 100% and 82.7% respectively. No relationship was found between MSP diagnosis results and clinical pathological typing.

Although the aging process and the pathways that regulate it have been extensively studied, only in the last decade have we begun to appreciate that dynamic histone methylation may contribute to this process. In this review, we discuss recent work implicating histone methylation in aging. Loss of certain histone methyltransferases and demethylases changes lifespan in invertebrates, and alterations in histone methylation in aged organisms regulate lifespan and aging phenotypes, including oxidative stress-induced hormesis in yeast, insulin signaling in Caenorhabiditis elegans and mammals, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in mammals. In all cases where histone methylation has been shown to impact aging and aging phenotypes, it does so by regulating transcription, suggesting that this is a major mechanism of its action in this context. Histone methylation additionally regulates or is regulated by other cellular pathways that contribute to or combat aging. Given the numerous processes that regulate aging and histone methylation, and are in turn regulated by them, the role of histone methylation in aging is almost certainly underappreciated.",4.381,105

Reports that DNA methylation differs between the queen and worker castes in social insects [1-4] have implied a role for DNA methylation in regulating division of labor. To better understand the function of DNA methylation in social insects, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on brains of the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, whose colonies alternate between reproductive (queen-like) and brood care (worker-like) phases [5]. Many cytosines were methylated in all replicates (on average 29.5% of the methylated cytosines in a given replicate), indicating that a large proportion of the C. biroi brain methylome is robust. Robust DNA methylation occurred preferentially in exonic CpGs of highly and stably expressed genes involved in core functions. Our analyses did not detect any differences in DNA methylation between the queen-like and worker-like phases, suggesting that DNA methylation is not associated with changes in reproduction and behavior in C. biroi. Finally, many cytosines were methylated in one sample only, due to either biological or experimental variation. By applying the statistical methods used in previous studies [1-4, 6] to our data, we show that such sample-specific DNA methylation may underlie the previous findings of queen- and worker-specific methylation. We argue that there is currently no evidence that genome-wide variation in DNA methylation is associated with the queen and worker castes in social insects, and we call for a more careful interpretation of the available data.",0,1616

METHODS: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a vitamin-D-free diet with ultraviolet-free light during pregnancy (early-VDD group). Insulin resistance in the male offspring was assessed by HOMA-IR, OGTT and euglycaemic clamp. NEFA, oxidative stress and inflammation levels were estimated as risk factors for insulin resistance. DNA methylation was examined by bisulfate sequencing PCR analysis. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the effect of DNA methylation. RESULTS: The offspring in the early-VDD group had significantly higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR levels, markedly reduced glucose tolerance and significantly lower tissue sensitivity to exogenous insulin at 16 weeks (all p < 0.05) compared with control offspring. Significantly higher serum and liver IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations were observed in the offspring of the early-VDD group at 0, 3, 8 and 16 weeks. Expression of hepatic Ikappabalpha (also known as Nfkbia) mRNA and nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor alpha (IkappaBalpha) protein was persistently lower in the early-VDD offspring at all time points, and their hepatic Ikappabalpha methylation levels at the cytosine phosphate guanine site +331 were significantly higher at 0 and 16 weeks (all p < 0.01). Methylation at Ikappabalpha first exon +331 markedly decreased the luciferase activity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy results in insulin resistance in the offspring, which is associated with persistently increased inflammation. Persistently decreased Ikappabalpha expression, potentially caused by changes in Ikappabalpha methylation, plays an important role in persistent inflammation.",6.671,649

This study investigates the molecular causes behind this phenomenon. Genome wide DNA methylation of exposed and unexposed EVT was assessed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450 K array). We identified 444 differentially methylated CpG loci in dNK-treated EVT compared with medium control (P < 0.05). The genes associated with these loci had critical biological roles in cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, cellular assembly and organization by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Furthermore, 23 mobility-related genes were identified by IPA from dNK-treated EVT. Among these genes, CLDN4 (encoding claudin-4) and FUT4 (encoding fucosyltransferase IV) were chosen for follow-up studies because of their biological relevance from research on tumor cells. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of both CLDN4 and FUT4 in dNK-treated EVT were significantly reduced compared with control (P < 0.01 for both CLDN4 and FUT4 mRNA expression; P < 0.001 for CLDN4 and P < 0.01 for FUT4 protein expression), and were inversely correlated with DNA methylation. Knocking down CLDN4 and FUT4 by small interfering RNA reduced trophoblast invasion, possibly through the altered matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and/or MMP-9 expression and activity. Taken together, dNK alter EVT mobility at least partially in association with an alteration of DNA methylation profile. Hypermethylation of CLDN4 and FUT4 reduces protein expression.

Current therapies are often only marginally effective, and improved options will almost certainly benefit from further insight into the various processes contributing to gliomagenesis and pathology. While molecular characterization of these tumours classifies them on the basis of genetic alterations and chromosomal abnormalities, DNA methylation patterns are increasingly understood to play a role in glioma pathogenesis. Indeed, a subset of gliomas associated with improved survival is characterized by the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), which can be induced by the expression of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2). Aberrant methylation of particular genes or regulatory elements, within the context of G-CIMP-positive and/or negative tumours, has also been shown to be associated with differential survival. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of DNA methylation in adult diffuse gliomas.

We observed that astrocytic tumors with lower ATRX expression harbored higher DNA methylation level at chromatin end and astrocytic tumors with ATRX-low had distinct gene expression profile and DNA methylation profile compared with ATRX-high tumors. Then, we uncovered that several ATRX associated biological functions in the DNA methylation and mRNA expression profile (GEP), including apoptotic process, DNA-dependent positive regulation of transcription, chromatin modification, and observed that ATRX expression was companied by MGMT methylation and expression.

 developmental biology",2014,"Drosophila melanogaster is often considered to lack genomic 5-methylcytosine (m(5) C), an opinion reinforced by two whole genome bisulfite-sequencing studies that failed to find m(5) C. New evidence, however, indicates that genomic methylation is indeed present in the fly, albeit in small quantities and in unusual patterns. At embryonic stage 5, m(5) C occurs in short strand-specific regions that cover  approximately 1% of the genome, at tissue levels suggesting a distribution restricted to a subset of nuclei. Its function is not obvious, but methylation in subsets of nuclei would obscure functional associations since transcript levels and epigenetic modifications are assayed in whole embryos. Surprisingly, Mt2, the fly's only candidate DNA methyltransferase, is not necessary for the observed methylation. Full evaluation of the functions of genome methylation in Drosophila must await discovery and experimental inactivation of the DNA methyltransferase, as well as a better understanding of the pattern and developmental regulation of genomic m(5) C.",0,1910

METHODS: Eighty-three patients with cerebral infarction and 94 healthy controls were enrolled. Based on cerebral MR findings, the size of infarction, extent of intracranial atherosclerosis, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and Barthel index were calculated. Methylation-specific PCR was used to analyze the methylation status of the EC-SOD gene in peripheral blood samples and its correlation with cerebral infarction. RESULTS: The rate of EC-SOD gene promoter region methylation of the cerebral infarction group was lower than that of the control group (30.1% vs. 53.2%, P < 0.05). Patients with larger area of cerebral infarction (>4 cm in diameter) showed a lower methylation rate than those with a smaller cerebral infarction (0 vs. 39.1%, P < 0.05). Based on their cerebral MRA, 57 patients were divided into none, mild, moderate, and severe cerebral arteriosclerosis groups. The rate of EC-SOD gene methylation of the four groups showed a downward trend (at 45.5%, 42.9%, 23.8%, and 14.3%, respectively), though no statistical significance was found (P > 0.05). For the cerebral infarction group, those with higher rate of methylation had lower NIHSS scores (P < 0.05) but insignificantly higher Barthel index (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The EC-SOD methylation frequency of case group was lower than the control group. The methylation status is associated with the size of cerebral infarction, degree of cerebral arteriosclerosis and severity of neurological impairment.",0,56

We explored whether natural polyploidization in Dianthus broteri complex resulted in substantial changes in global DNA cytosine methylation associated to ploidy. Global cytosine methylation was estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 12 monocytotypic populations with different ploidies (2x, 4x, 6x, 12x) broadly distributed within D. broteri distribution range. The effects of ploidy level and local variation on methylation were assessed by generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Dianthus broteri exhibited a higher methylation percent ( 33%) than expected by its monoploid genome size and a large variation among study populations (range: 29.3-35.3%). Global methylation tended to increase with ploidy but did not significantly differ across levels due to increased variation within the highest-order polyploidy categories. Methylation varied more among hexaploid and dodecaploid populations, despite such cytotypes showing more restricted geographic location and increased genetic relatedness than diploids and tetraploids. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of an HPLC method in providing precise and genome reference-free global measure of DNA cytosine methylation, suitable to advance current knowledge of the roles of this epigenetic mechanism in polyploidization processes.",0,425

This mechanism involves a transsulfuration pathway. Based on these new data, clinical and experimental models on the relationships between Hcy and folate pathways in vascular disease and information on the Hcy controversy have been reanalyzed in the present review. Most interventional trials focused on Hcy lowering by folate administration did not exclude patients routinely taking the arachidonate inhibitor aspirin. This may have influenced the results of some of these trials. It is also clear that nutritional intake of folate affects several enzymatic reactions of the methionine-Hcy cycle and associated one-carbon metabolism and, thereby, both methylation reactions and redox balance. Hence, it is conceivable that the abnormally high Hcy levels seen in pathologic states reflect a poorly elucidated perturbation of such reactions and of such balance. While it is unknown whether there is an interplay between H2S, methylation reactions, and redox balance, measuring the sole reduction of blood Hcy that follows folate administration may well be an oversimplified approach to a complex biologic perturbation. The need to investigate this complex framework is thoroughly discussed in this article.",3.876,1363

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize AME for possible novel HSD11B2 mutations and to define the role of HSD11B2 promoter methylation in the phenotypic expression of the disease. SUBJECTS: Two proband brothers and 10 relatives participated in the study. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA was used for HSD11B2 exon sequencing, and a new predicted structure of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 was generated by an in silico three-dimensional modeling. Promoter methylation was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Urinary tetrahydrocortisol plus allotetrahydrocortisol to tetrahydrocortisone ratio, a surrogate marker of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity, was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: A novel homozygous variant at HSD11B2 exon 3 site (c.C662G) resulting in an alanine-to-glycine change at position 221 was discovered by sequencing the DNA of the probands. A monoallelic mutation was found in the DNA of the parents and other four relatives. In silico three-dimensional modeling showed that the Ala221Gly substitution could perturb a hydrophobic interaction by reducing the enzymatic affinity for the substrate. The HSD11B2 promoter methylation of normotensive heterozygous relatives was similar to that of wild types, whereas the hypertensive heterozygous subjects showed higher methylation than wild types, consistently with a transcriptional repressive effect of promoter hypermethylation. CONCLUSIONS: A novel HSD11B2 functional mutation accounting for an Ala221Gly substitution causes AME. The hypertension phenotype is also epigenetically modulated by HSD11B2 methylation in subjects heterozygous for the mutation.",0,951

Samples from fifty one patients with MSI positive sporadic colorectal cancer were included. DNA was extracted from tumor samples. Promoter methylation was analyzed using bisulfite modification and was detected by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. BRAF gene was amplified using specific primers and mutations were detected by real time PCR. Simultaneous methylation was transformed in a new variable called CMETH2. Frequency of CMETH2 was analyzed and compared with other clinicopathological variables. 33.3 % of patients were positive for CMETH2 and 25 % had BRAF V600E mutation. CMETH2 was related with proximal location, with poorly differentiated tumors and with BRAF V600E mutation. CMETH2 only showed influence in the overall survival (OS) in patients with distal tumors. However, with regard to the disease free survival (DFS) measure, CMETH2 was independent prognostic factor. We were able to discriminate tumors with high methylation features using a transformation analysis of variables into a new computed one (CMETH2). CMETH2 has demonstrated to be a useful prognostic factor in MSI tumors. The prognostic value of CMETH2 in DFS was independent of other clinicopathological variables.

In children, not much of the toxic outcomes like dermatological lesions are observed but it is thought that the exposure leads to transient alteration in their biological processes that leads to various deleterious health effects later on. We evaluated the global methylation status by analyzing the LINE-1 methylation profile in children from arsenic exposed region between the age group 5-15 years along with the cytogenetic stress induced by arsenic as measured by lymphocyte micronucleus (MN) frequency. A total of 52 arsenic exposed and 32 unexposed children were analyzed. Whole blood DNA was used to measure the LINE-1 methylation by qRT-MSP. We found a significant association of MN-frequency in exposed individuals with highly depleted LINE-1 methylation compared to the exposed individuals with near baseline (which was comparable to unexposed control) methylation index as well as with those with the hypermethylated LINE-1 promoters. From our results, we interpret that LINE-1 methylation index may serve as a potent global epigenetic mark to detect the degree of arsenic genotoxicity at a very early age. We propose that this may be utilized to determine the extent of toxic influence exerted by arsenic, from a very early age.",0,758

To search for epigenetic events we used methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) to compare the methylation status of 64 tissue samples of sinonasal carcinomas with 19 control samples. We also compared the human papilloma virus (HPV) status with DNA methylation. Using a 20% cut-off for methylation, we observed significantly higher methylation in RASSF1, CDH13, ESR1 and TP73 genes in the sinonasal cancer group compared with the control group. HPV positivity was found in 15/64 (23.4 %) of all samples in the carcinoma group and in no sample in the control group. No correlation was found between DNA methylation and HPV status. In conclusion, our study showed that there are significant differences in promoter methylation in the RASSF1, ESR 1, TP73 and CDH13 genes between sinonasal carcinoma and normal sinonasal tissue, suggesting the importance of epigenetic changes in these genes in carcinogenesis of the sinonasal area.

In the present study, semi-quantitative the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses showed MyoD and Myf5 were expressed in activated and quiescent C2C12 cells. MyoG was expressed in a later stage of myogenesis. Pax7 was weakly expressed in differentiated C2C12 cells. To further understand the regulation of expression of these genes, the DNA methylation status of Pax7, MyoD, and Myf5 was determined by bisulfite sequencing PCR. During the C2C12 myoblasts fusion process, the changes of promoter and exon 1 methylation of Pax7, MyoD, and Myf5 genes were observed. In addition, an inverse relationship of low methylation and high expression was found.

Two CpG islands (CGIs) were predicted located in the first exon of CiMDA5, of which the first CpG island was 427 bp in length possessed 29 candidate CpG loci and 34 CpA loci, and the second one was 130 bp in length involving 7 CpG loci as well as 10 CpA loci. By bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP), the methylation statuses were detected in spleen of 70 individuals divided into resistant/susceptible groups post challenge experiment, and the resistance-association analysis was performed with Chi-square test. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to explore the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in CiMDA5. Results indicated that the methylation levels of CpA/CpG sites at +200, +202, +204, +207 nt, which consisted of a putative densely methylated element (DME), were significantly higher in the susceptible group than those in the resistant group. Meanwhile, the average transcription of CiMDA5 was down-regulated in the susceptible individuals compared with the resistant individuals. Evidently, the DNA methylation may be the negative modulator of CiMDA5 antiviral expression. Collectively, the methylation levels of CiMDA5 demonstrated the tight association with the resistance against GCRV and the negative-regulated roles in mRNA expression.

METHODS: We evaluated the methylation of AJAP1, HS3ST2, SOX1, and PTGDR from 61 AH patients undergoing hysterectomy. Endometrial biopsy samples were analyzed by bisulfite conversion and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. A methylation index was used to predict the presence of cancer. To confirm the silencing effects of DNA methylation, immunohistochemical analysis of AJAP1, HS3ST2, and SOX1 was performed using tissue microarray. RESULTS: Fourteen (23%) patients had EC at hysterectomy. AJAP1, HS3ST2, and SOX1 were highly methylated in the EC patients' biopsy samples (p</=0.023). AJAP1, HS3ST2, and SOX1 protein expression was significantly higher in patients with AH only (p</=0.038). The predictive value of AJAP1, HS3ST2, and SOX1 methylation for EC was 0.81, 0.72, and 0.70, respectively. Combined testing of both AJAP1 and HS3ST2 methylation had a positive predictive value of 56%, methylation of any one of AJAP1, SOX1, or HS3ST2 had a 100% negative predictive value.

To test the epigenetic control of apomixis, a study on the distribution of cytosine methylation at the apomixis locus and the effect of artificial DNA demethylation on the mode of reproduction was undertaken in two apomictic Paspalum species. The 5-methylcytosine distribution in the apomixis-controlling genomic region was studied in P. simplex by methylation-sensitive restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and in P. notatum by fluorescene in situ hybridization (FISH). The effect of DNA demethylation was studied on the mode of reproduction of P. simplex by progeny test analysis of apomictic plants treated with the demethylating agent 5'-azacytidine. A high level of cytosine methylation was detected at the apomixis-controlling genomic region in both species. By analysing a total of 374 open pollination progeny, it was found that artificial demethylation had little or no effect on apospory, whereas it induced a significant depression of parthenogenesis.

With the use of isotope internal standards ([2H3]5-mdC and [2H3]5-hmdC) and online solid-phase extraction, the detection limits of 5-mdC and 5-hmdC were estimated to be 0.01 and 0.02 pg respectively, which correspond to a 0.000006% and 0.00001% methylation and hydroxymethylation level. This method was applied to investigate whether DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation exists in C. elegans. The present study for the first time demonstrates that 5-mdC is present in C. elegans genomic DNA (0.0019-0.0033% of cytosine methylated) using LC-MS/MS, whereas another epigenetic modification, 5-hmdC, is not detectable. Furthermore, we found that C. elegans DNA was hypo- or hyper-methylated in a dose-dependent manner by the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-inhibiting drug decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) or cadmium respectively.

Here, we compared human-macaque and human-mouse protein evolutionary rates against experimentally determined single base-resolution DNA methylation data, revealing that promoter methylation level is positively correlated with protein evolutionary rates but negatively correlated with TF/miRNA regulations, whereas the opposite was observed for gene body methylation level. Our results showed that the relative importance of these regulatory factors in determining the rate of mammalian protein evolution is as follows: Promoter methylation  approximately  miRNA regulation > gene body methylation > TF regulation, and further indicated that promoter methylation and miRNA regulation have a significant dependent effect on protein evolutionary rates.

In addition, we measured the expression levels of IGF2, TNF-alpha and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1, 3a and 3b. Our results showed that the genomic DNA methylation levels in the liver, heart and muscle increased during embryonic development and that the methylation level of the liver was significantly higher in mid-anaphase. In both the muscle and liver, the promoter methylation levels of TNF-alpha first increased and then decreased, whereas the gene body methylation levels remained lower at embryonic ages E8, 11 and 14 before increasing notably at E17. The promoter methylation level of IGF2 decreased persistently, whereas the methylation levels in the gene body showed a continuous increase. No differences in the expression of TNF-alpha were found among E8, 11 and 14, whereas a significant increase was observed at E17. IGF2 showed increasing expression level during the examined embryonic stages. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of DNMTs increased with increasing embryonic ages. These results suggest that chicken shows increasing genomic DNA methylation patterns during the embryonic period. Furthermore, the genomic DNA methylation levels in tissues are closely related to the genes expression levels, and gene expression may be simultaneously regulated by promoter hypomethylation and gene body hypermethylation.",3.234,1773

However, there were inconsistent conclusions in the association between APC promoter methylation and breast cancer. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the clinicopathological significance and diagnosis role of APC methylation in breast cancer. In total, 3172 samples from 29 studies were performed in this study. The odds ratio (OR) of APC methylation was 5.92 (95% CI = 3.16-11.07) in breast cancer cases compared to controls,. The APC promoter methylation was associated with cancer stage (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.28-0.80, P = 0.006), lymph node metastases (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.36-0.84, P = 0.005) and ER status (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.03-1.73, P = 0.003) in breast cancer.

These modifications aid in the folding and stabilization of nascent rRNA molecules and their assembly into ribosomal particles. The genomes of hyperthermophilic archaea encode large numbers of C/D box sRNA genes, suggesting an increased necessity for rRNA stabilization at extreme growth temperatures. RESULTS: We have identified the complete sets of C/D box sRNAs from seven archaea using RNA-Seq methodology. In total, 489 C/D box sRNAs were identified, each containing two guide regions. A combination of computational and manual analyses predicts 719 guide interactions with 16S and 23S rRNA molecules. This first pan-archaeal description of guide sequences identifies (i) modified rRNA nucleotides that are frequently conserved between species and (ii) regions within rRNA that are hotspots for 2'-O-methylation. Gene duplication, rearrangement, mutational drift and convergent evolution of sRNA genes and guide sequences were observed. In addition, several C/D box sRNAs were identified that use their two guides to target locations distant in the rRNA sequence but close in the secondary and tertiary structure. We propose that they act as RNA chaperones and facilitate complex folding events between distant sequences. CONCLUSIONS: This pan-archaeal analysis of C/D box sRNA guide regions identified conserved patterns of rRNA 2'-O-methylation in archaea. The interaction between the sRNP complexes and the nascent rRNA facilitates proper folding and the methyl modifications stabilize higher order rRNA structure within the assembled ribosome.",3.986,417

A cohort (n = 118) of male partners of couples who were undergoing fertility assessment because of an idiopathic inability to conceive were recruited. Sperm motility parameters were determined by computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA), while sperm quality was assessed using World Health Organization criteria, mtDNA copy number was measured by real-time PCR, and DNA methylation patterns were analyzed employing high-melting resolution PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. The mtDNA copy number negatively correlated with semen parameters, including sperm motility, concentration, morphology, progression, and motion characteristics (r for -0.19 to -0.54; P < 0.05 for all). As a surrogate marker for global DNA methylation, LINE-1 negatively correlated with sperm motility (r = -0.25; P = 0.009). Meanwhile, after adjustment for age, length of abstinence, smoking, and alcohol intake, there was a suggested association for increased LINE-1 methylation and mtDNA copy number tertiles versus sperm motility (odd ratios were 1.0, 2.6, and 4.7, and 1.0, 2.5, and 4.9, respectively). Altered mtDNA copy number and DNA methylation may serve as genetic and epigenetic markers to assess human sperm quality together with CASA parameters.",3.318,1719

Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and survival curve analyses were utilized to measure the expression and DNA methylation patterns of SIX2 in a cohort of WT tissues, with a view to assessing their diagnostic and prognostic value. Relative expression of SIX2 mRNA was higher, while the promoter methylation level was lower in the WT than control group (P < 0.05) and closely associated with poor survival prognosis of WT children (P < 0.05). Increased expression and decreased methylation of SIX2 were correlated with increasing tumor size, clinical stage, vascular invasion, and unfavorable histological differentiation (P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.579 for methylation and 0.917 for expression in WT venous blood, indicating higher diagnostic yield of preoperative SIX2 expression. The preoperative venous blood SIX2 expression level serves as an underlying biomarker for early diagnosis of WT.

Multiple lesions of different histological grades and duration are frequently present on the cervix. To gain more insight into the possible epigenetic heterogeneity and its consequences for the methylation status in cervical scrapes, we performed an exploratory study of CADM1/MAL methylation in different grades of CIN lesions present in women with multiple cervical biopsies. CADM1-M18 and MAL-M1 methylation was assessed using a standardised, multiplex, quantitative methylation specific PCR on 178 biopsies with various grades of CIN in 65 women, and in their corresponding cervical scrapes. CADM1/MAL methylation positivity increased with disease severity, from 5.5% in normal biopsies to 63.3% and 100% in biopsies with CIN3 and cervical cancer, respectively. In the majority (8/9) of women where besides a CIN2/3 lesion a biopsy from normal cervical tissue was present, the CIN2/3 biopsy was CADM1/MAL methylation positive and the normal biopsy was CADM1/MAL methylation negative. A good concordance (78%) was found between CADM1/MAL methylation results on the scrapes and the biopsy with the worst diagnosis, particularly between samples of women with CIN3 and cervical cancer (92% and 100% concordance, respectively). Thus, in women with multiple cervical biopsies, CADM1/MAL methylation increases with severity of the lesion and is lesion-specific. CADM1/MAL methylation status in cervical scrapes appears to be representative of the worst underlying lesion, particularly for CIN3 and cervical cancer.",5.085,98

A total of 81 women with liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples, histological results, and positive HPV-DNA test for HPV type 16 only were included in this study. HPV-16 L1 methylation and E6/E7 mRNA levels were measured using methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis and Quantivirus(R)HPV E6/E7 RNA 3.0 assay (bDNA), respectively, in the same residue of LBC samples. The current date showed a positive correlation between the HPV-16 L1 methylation and the E6/E7 mRNA levels. The L1 methylation and mRNA levels both increased with disease severity.

Environmental effects were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that the extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic variants in both cis and trans, including a major trans-association close to the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body methylation (GBM) was not affected by growth temperature, but was instead correlated with the latitude of origin. Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant fraction of the genome, and this was associated with increased transcription for the genes affected. GWAS revealed that this effect was largely due to trans-acting loci, many of which showed evidence of local adaptation.",9.322,650

Here genome-wide differential methylation between primary and recurrent HCC cell lines (Hep-11 and Hep-12) from the same patient was characterized. The HCC samples from two independent cohorts, complete with follow-up data, were used to validate the feasibility of the selected methylation biomarkers in predicting HCC prognosis. A methylation array assay identified 30 candidate genes or intergenic-fragments with an absolute methylation fold-change >2.0 between these cell lines; 22 candidates were hypomethylated in Hep-12 cells relative to Hep-11 cells. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed these results. Most importantly, classification of tumors by LINE-2 methylation level was significantly associated with HCC recurrence in both cohorts (P < 0.02). Similarly, MAD1L1 and LINC00682 methylation levels also correlated with HCC recurrence. Survival analysis showed that a combined baseline LINE-2, MAD1L1, and LINC00682 methylation signature was significantly associated with short recurrence-free survival in patients from both cohorts. A synergic effect was observed between these markers on both recurrence-free survival (P < 0.010) and overall survival (P < 0.040). In conclusion, low levels of LINE-2, MAD1L1, and LINC00682 methylation were associated with recurrence and decreased overall survival in HCC patients. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",4.808,534

Longitudinal, prospective studies can aid in the unravelment of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the disease development. High compliance rates can be expected in these studies when data is collected using non-invasive and convenient procedures. Saliva is an attractive biofluid to analyze changes in DNA methylation patterns. We investigated in a pilot study the differential methylation in saliva of RA (n = 5) compared to healthy controls (n = 5) using the Illumina Methylation 450K BeadChip platform. We evaluated the results against the results obtained in mononuclear blood cells from the same individuals. Differences in methylation patterns from saliva and mononuclear blood cells were clearly distinguishable (PAdj<0.001 and |Deltabeta|>0.2), though the methylation status of about 96% of the cg-sites was comparable between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva. When comparing RA cases with healthy controls, the number of differentially methylated sites (DMS) in saliva and blood were 485 and 437 (P<0.05 and |Deltabeta|>0.1), respectively, of which 216 were in common. The methylation levels of these sites were significantly correlated between blood and saliva. The absolute levels of methylation in blood and saliva were confirmed for 3 selected DMS in the PM20D1, STK32C, and FGFR2 genes using pyrosequencing analysis. The differential methylation could only be confirmed for DMS in PM20D1 and STK32C genes in saliva. We show that saliva can be used for genome-wide methylation analysis and that it is possible to identify DMS when comparing RA cases and healthy controls.

Their effect on the initiation and progression of HCC was also investigated by analyzing the clinicopathological data. The results of the present study revealed that the methylation level of RIZ1 and GSTP1 genes in HCC was significantly increased compared with that in the adjacent tissues (P<0.01) and the normal liver tissues (P<0.01). The methylation frequency of P16 and RASSF1A genes was not significantly increased compared with that observed in the adjacent tissues (P>0.05) but was significantly increased compared with the normal tissues (P<0.01). In HCC tissues, the methylation frequency of the GSTP1 gene in tumors with capsular invasion was significantly increased compared with that in tumors without capsular invasion (P<0.05). The methylation frequency of P16 gene in hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg)-positive HCC patients was significantly increased compared with that in HbsAg-negative patients (P<0.05). The methylation status of RIZ1 and RASSF1A genes was not significantly correlated with the clinicopathological data (P>0.05). Previous studies have demonstrated that the methylation status of RIZ1 and GSTP1 genes is HCC-specific, and thus may be used as a biomarker to assist the clinical diagnosis of HCC.

The exposures were performed in spring and autumn, with identical study procedures. In each season, healthy Wistar rats were exposed to TRAP at for 4 h, 7 d, 14 d, or 28 d. Global DNA methylation (LINE-1 and Alu) and specific gene methylation (p16(CDKN2A), APC, and iNOS) in the DNA from blood and lung tissues were quantified by pyrosequencing. Multiple linear regression was applied to assess the influence of air pollutants on DNA methylation levels. The levels of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in the high and moderate groups were significantly higher than in the control group. The DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between spring and autumn.

With next generation sequencing technologies, it is now possible to identify differential methylation patterns by considering methylation at the single CG site level in an entire genome. However, it is challenging to analyze large and complex NGS data. In order to address this difficult question, we have developed a new statistical method using a hidden Markov model and Fisher's exact test (HMM-Fisher) to identify differentially methylated cytosines and regions. We first use a hidden Markov chain to model the methylation signals to infer the methylation state as Not methylated (N), Partly methylated (P), and Fully methylated (F) for each individual sample. We then use Fisher's exact test to identify differentially methylated CG sites. We show the HMM-Fisher method and compare it with commonly cited methods using both simulated data and real sequencing data. The results show that HMM-Fisher outperforms the current available methods to which we have compared. HMM-Fisher is efficient and robust in identifying heterogeneous DM regions.",1.127,1967

Its inherent risks limit its widespread use. Differential liver DNA methylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene promoter has recently been shown to stratify patients in terms of fibrosis severity but requires access to liver tissue. The aim of this study was to assess whether DNA methylation of circulating DNA could be detected in human plasma and potentially used to stratify liver fibrosis severity in patients with NAFLD. DESIGN: Patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and age-matched controls were recruited from the liver and gastroenterology clinics at the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Plasma cell-free circulating DNA methylation of PPARgamma was quantitatively assessed by pyrosequencing. Liver DNA methylation was quantitatively assessed by pyrosequencing NAFLD explant tissue, subjected to laser capture microdissection (LCM). Patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) were also subjected to plasma DNA and LCM pyrosequencing. RESULTS: 26 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included. Quantitative plasma DNA methylation of PPARgamma stratified patients into mild (Kleiner 1-2) and severe (Kleiner 3-4) fibrosis (CpG1: 63% vs 86%, p<0.05; CpG2: 51% vs 65% p>0.05). Hypermethylation at the PPARgamma promoter of plasma DNA correlated with changes in hepatocellular rather than myofibroblast DNA methylation. Similar results were demonstrated in patients with ALD cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Differential DNA methylation at the PPARgamma promoter can be detected within the pool of cell-free DNA of human plasma. With further validation, plasma DNA methylation of PPARgamma could potentially be used to non-invasively stratify liver fibrosis severity in patients with NAFLD. Plasma DNA methylation signatures reflect the molecular pathology associated with fibrotic liver disease.",14.66,1466

METHODS: Differentially labeled primers specific for methylated and unmethylated FMR1 alleles were used to amplify bisulfite-modified DNA, followed by capillary electrophoresis. Twenty-four reference DNAs and 107 patient samples were analyzed to evaluate assay performance. RESULTS: Repeat size, AGG interruption pattern and methylation state were correctly identified in all tested samples. The assay also detected skewed X-inactivation when present in females, and somatic mosaicism in fragile X males.

We used methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) and transposon methylation display (TMD) techniques, to assess the methylation status of random genomic CCGG sites and CCGG sites flanking transposable elements (TEs), respectively. Both techniques were applied to the DNA of 50 emmer accessions which were collected from five different geographically isolated regions. In order to ensure the assessment of heritable epigenetic variation, all accessions were grown under common garden conditions for two generations. In all accessions, the difference in methylation levels of CCGG sites, including CCGG sites that flanked TEs, were not statistically significant and relatively high, ranging between 46 and 76 %. The pattern of methylation was significantly different among accessions, such that clear and statistically significant population-specific methylation patterns were observed. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have observed population-unique heritable methylation patterns in emmer wheat accessions originating from five geographically isolated regions.

We hypothesized that genetic factors involved in these methylation levels may be associated with the genetic risk of SZ susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we used results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SZ genome-wide association study (GWAS). We observe an enrichment of SZ-associated SNPs in the mQTLs of which the associated CpG site is also correlated with differential gene expression in SZ. While this enrichment was already apparent when using nominal significant thresholds, enrichment was even more pronounced when applying more stringent significance levels. One locus, previously identified as susceptibility locus in a SZ GWAS, involves SNP rs11191514:C>T, which regulates DNA methylation of calcium homeostasis modulator 1 that is also associated with differential gene expression in patients. Overall, our results suggest that epigenetic variation plays an important role in SZ susceptibility and that the integration of analyses of genetic, epigenetic and gene expression profiles may be a biologically meaningful approach for identifying disease susceptibility loci, even when using whole blood data in studies of brain-related disorders.",2.649,611
26116422,Dual Targeting of the Protein Methyltransferase PrmA Contributes to Both Chloroplastic and Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L11 Methylation in Arabidopsis.,"['Mazzoleni M', 'Figuet S', 'Martin-Laffon J', 'Mininno M', 'Gilgen A', 'Leroux M', 'Brugiere S', 'Tardif M', 'Alban C', 'Ravanel S']",Plant & cell physiology,2015,"Methylation of ribosomal proteins has long been described in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but our knowledge about the enzymes responsible for these modifications in plants is scarce. The bacterial protein methyltransferase PrmA catalyzes the trimethylation of ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) at three distinct sites. The role of these modifications is still unknown. Here, we show that PrmA from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPrmA) is dually targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria. Mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays indicated that the enzyme methylates RPL11 in plasto- and mitoribosomes in vivo. We determined that the Arabidopsis and Escherichia coli PrmA enzymes share similar product specificity, making trimethylated residues, but, despite an evolutionary relationship, display a difference in substrate site specificity. In contrast to the bacterial enzyme that trimethylates the epsilon-amino group of two lysine residues and the N-terminal alpha-amino group, AtPrmA methylates only one lysine in the MAFCK(D/E)(F/Y)NA motif of plastidial and mitochondrial RPL11. The plant enzyme possibly methylates the N-terminus of plastidial RPL11, whereas mitochondrial RPL11 is N-alpha-acetylated by an unknown acetyltransferase. Lastly, we found that an Arabidopsis prma-null mutant is viable in standard environmental conditions and no molecular defect could be associated with a lack of RPL11 methylation in leaf chloroplasts or mitochondria. However, the conservation of PrmA during the evolution of photosynthetic eukaryotes together with the location of methylated residues at the binding site of translation factors to ribosomes suggests that RPL11 methylation in plant organelles could be involved, in combination with other post-translational modifications, in optimizing ribosome function.",0,104

Here, the methylation status of a salinity-tolerant wheat cultivar (cv. SR3, derived from a somatic hybridization event) and its progenitor parent (cv. JN177) was explored both globally and within a set of 24 genes responsive to salinity stress. A further comparison was made between DNA extracted from plants grown under control conditions and when challenged by salinity stress. The SR3 and JN177 genomes differed with respect to their global methylation level, and methylation levels were reduced by exposure to salinity stress. We found the genetic stress- (triggered by a combination of different genomes in somatic hybridization) induced methylation pattern of 13 loci in non-stressed SR3; the same 13 loci were found to undergo methylation in salinity-stressed JN177. For the salinity-responsive genes, SR3 and JN177 also showed different methylation modifications. C methylation polymorphisms induced by salinity stress were present in both the promoter and coding regions of some of the 24 selected genes, but only the former were associated with changes in transcript abundance. The expression of both TaFLS1 (encoding a flavonol synthase) and TaWRSI5 (encoding a Bowman-Birk-type protease inhibitor), which showed both a different expression and a different DNA methylation level between SR3 and JN177, enhanced the salinity tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana. C methylation changes appear to be a common component of the plant response to stress, and methylation changes triggered by somatic hybridization may contribute to the superior salinity tolerance of SR3.",0,1809

The participants were 463 mother-child pairs of Dutch national origin from a large population-based birth cohort in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In early pregnancy (median 13.0 weeks, 90% range 10.4-17.1), we assessed the maternal folate and homocysteine blood concentrations, folic acid supplement use, and the MTHFR C677T genotype in mothers and newborns. In newborns, DNA methylation was measured in umbilical cord blood white blood cells at 11 regions of the seven genes: NR3C1, DRD4, 5-HTT, IGF2DMR, H19, KCNQ1OT1, and MTHFR. The associations between the 1-C determinants and DNA methylation were examined using linear mixed models. An association was observed between maternal folate deficiency and lower newborn DNA methylation, which attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders. The maternal MTHFR TT genotype was significantly associated with lower DNA methylation. However, maternal homocysteine and folate concentrations, folic acid supplement use, and the MTHFR genotype in the newborn were not associated with newborn DNA methylation. The maternal MTHFR C677T genotype, as a determinant of folate status and 1-C metabolism, is associated with variations in the epigenome of a selection of genes in newborns.

26717574,Epigenetic DNA Methylation Linked to Social Dominance.,"['Lenkov K', 'Lee MH', 'Lenkov OD', 'Swafford A', 'Fernald RD']",PloS one,2015,"Social status hierarchies are ubiquitous in vertebrate social systems, including humans. It is well known that social rank can influence quality of life dramatically among members of social groups. For example, high-ranking individuals have greater access to resources, including food and mating prerogatives that, in turn, have a positive impact on their reproductive success and health. In contrast low ranking individuals typically have limited reproductive success and may experience lasting social and physiological costs. Ultimately, social rank and behavior are regulated by changes in gene expression. However, little is known about mechanisms that transduce social cues into transcriptional changes. Since social behavior is a dynamic process, we hypothesized that a molecular mechanism such as DNA methylation might play a role these changes. To test this hypothesis, we used an African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, in which social rank dictates reproductive access. We show that manipulating global DNA methylation state strongly biases the outcomes of social encounters. Injecting DNA methylating and de-methylating agents in low status animals competing for status, we found that animals with chemically increased methylation states were statistically highly likely to ascend in rank. In contrast, those with inhibited methylation processes and thus lower methylation levels were statistically highly unlikely to ascend in rank. This suggests that among its many roles, DNA methylation may be linked to social status and more generally to social behavior.",3.234,1584

The imprinted genes, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19, are involved in fetal growth and each is regulated by DNA methylation. This study aimed to determine the association between maternal mental well-being during pregnancy and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of IGF2 (DMR0) and the IGF2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR) in newborn offspring. Maternal depression, anxiety and perceived stress were assessed at 28 weeks of pregnancy in the Barwon Infant Study (n=576). DNA methylation was measured in purified cord blood mononuclear cells using the Sequenom MassArray Platform. Maternal anxiety was associated with a decrease in average ICR methylation (Delta=-2.23%; 95% CI=-3.68 to -0.77%), and across all six of the individual CpG units in anxious compared with non-anxious groups. Birth weight and sex modified the association between prenatal anxiety and infant methylation. When stratified into lower (3530 g) and higher (>3530 g) birth weight groups using the median birth weight, there was a stronger association between anxiety and ICR methylation in the lower birth weight group (Delta=-3.89%; 95% CI=-6.06 to -1.72%), with no association in the higher birth weight group. When stratified by infant sex, there was a stronger association in female infants (Delta=-3.70%; 95% CI=-5.90 to -1.51%) and no association in males. All the linear regression models were adjusted for maternal age, smoking and folate intake. These findings show that maternal anxiety in pregnancy is associated with decreased IGF2/H19 ICR DNA methylation in progeny at birth, particularly in female, low birth weight neonates. ICR methylation may help link poor maternal mental health and adverse birth outcomes, but further investigation is needed.",5.62,1964

A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an enhancer in the MGMT promoter was previously identified to be highly significantly associated with risk for MGMT methylation in lung cancer and sputum from smokers. To further genetic investigations, a genome-wide association and replication study was conducted in two smoker cohorts to identify novel loci for MGMT methylation in sputum that were independent of the MGMT enhancer polymorphism. Two novel trans-acting loci (15q15.2 and 17q24.3) that were identified acted together with the enhancer SNP to empower risk prediction for MGMT methylation. We found that the predisposition to MGMT methylation arising from the 15q15.2 locus involved regulation of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component UBR1. UBR1 attenuation reduced turnover of MGMT protein and increased repair of O6-methylguanine in nitrosomethylurea-treated human bronchial epithelial cells, while also reducing MGMT promoter activity and abolishing MGMT induction. Overall, our results substantiate reduced gene transcription as a major mechanism for predisposition to MGMT methylation in the lungs of smokers, and support the importance of UBR1 in regulating MGMT homeostasis and DNA repair of alkylated DNA adducts in cells.",9.329,48

MMP expression may be regulated by DNA methylation. The purpose of the present investigation was to analyze the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in periapical granulomas and radicular cysts and to test the hypothesis that, in these lesions, their transcription may be modulated by DNA methylation. METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the DNA methylation pattern of the MMP2 gene in 13 fresh periapical granuloma samples and 10 fresh radicular cyst samples. Restriction enzyme digestion was used to assess methylation of the MMP9 gene in 12 fresh periapical granuloma samples and 10 fresh radicular cyst samples. MMP2 and MMP9 messenger RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All periapical lesions and healthy mucosa samples showed partial methylation of the MMP2 gene; however, periapical granulomas showed higher MMP2 mRNA expression levels than healthy mucosa (P = .014). A higher unmethylated profile of the MMP9 gene was found in periapical granulomas and radicular cysts compared with healthy mucosa. In addition, higher MMP9 mRNA expression was observed in the periapical lesions compared with healthy tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the unmethylated status of the MMP9 gene in periapical lesions may explain the observed up-regulation of messenger RNA transcription in these lesions.",3.375,1758

To assess the extent of epigenetic modifications and gene expression on the differentially methylated region (DMR) in ZBED6, we simultaneously examined DNA methylation and expression in six tissues from two different developmental stages (fetal bovine and adult bovine). The DNA methylation pattern was compared using bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP) and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA). The result of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that ZBED6 has a broad tissue distribution and is highly expressed in adult bovine (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The DNA methylation level was significantly different in liver, lung and spleen between the two cattle groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The adult bovine group exhibited a significantly higher mRNA level and lower DNA methylation level than the fetal bovine group in liver, lung, and spleen. No significant association was detected between DNA methylation level and muscle, heart, and kidney at two different stages. In this study, the statistical analyses indicated that DNA methylation patterns are associated with mRNA level in some tissues, these results may be a useful parameter to investigate muscle developmental in cattle and as a model for studies in other species, potentially contributing to an improvement of growth performance selection in beef cattle breeding program.",0.755,464

Since <2% of CpG sites are covered by the Illumina 450K array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing is still too expensive for many samples, computationally predicting DNA methylation levels based on 450K data would be valuable to discover more RA-related genes. RESULTS: We developed a computational model that is trained on 14 tissues with both whole genome bisulfite sequencing and 450K array data. This model integrates information derived from the similarity of local methylation pattern between tissues, the methylation information of flanking CpG sites and the methylation tendency of flanking DNA sequences. The predicted and measured methylation values were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 in leave-one-tissue-out cross-validations. Importantly, the majority (76%) of the top 10% differentially methylated loci among the 14 tissues was correctly detected using the predicted methylation values. Applying this model to 450K data of RA, osteoarthritis and normal FLS, we successfully expanded the coverage of CpG sites 18.5-fold and accounts for about 30% of all the CpGs in the human genome. By integrative omics study, we identified genes and pathways tightly related to RA pathogenesis, among which 12 genes were supported by triple evidences, including 6 genes already known to perform specific roles in RA and 6 genes as new potential therapeutic targets.

25609794,MethylMix: an R package for identifying DNA methylation-driven genes.,['Gevaert O'],"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2015,"DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an alternative mechanism to deregulate gene expression in a wide range of diseases. At the same time, high-throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of genome wide DNA methylation measurements. Yet, few tools exist that can formally identify hypo and hypermethylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally relevant for a particular disease. To accommodate this lack of tools, we developed MethylMix, an algorithm implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. MethylMix is based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix introduces a novel metric, the 'Differential Methylation value' or DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data are used to identify, besides differential, transcriptionally predictive methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.

MEP50 is hypothesized to be required for protein substrate recruitment to the catalytic domain of PRMT5. Here we demonstrate that the cross-dimer MEP50 is paired with its cognate PRMT5 molecule to promote histone methylation. We employed qualitative methylation assays and a novel ultrasensitive continuous assay to measure enzyme kinetics. We demonstrate that neither full-length human PRMT5 nor the Xenopus laevis PRMT5 catalytic domain has appreciable protein methyltransferase activity. We show that histones H4 and H3 bind PRMT5-MEP50 more efficiently compared with histone H2A(1-20) and H4(1-20) peptides. Histone binding is mediated through histone fold interactions as determined by competition experiments and by high density histone peptide array interaction studies. Nucleosomes are not a substrate for PRMT5-MEP50, consistent with the primary mode of interaction via the histone fold of H3-H4, obscured by DNA in the nucleosome. Mutation of a conserved arginine (Arg-42) on the MEP50 insertion loop impaired the PRMT5-MEP50 enzymatic efficiency by increasing its histone substrate Km, comparable with that of Caenorhabditis elegans PRMT5. We show that PRMT5-MEP50 prefers unmethylated substrates, consistent with a distributive model for dimethylation and suggesting discrete biological roles for mono- and dimethylarginine-modified proteins. We propose a model in which MEP50 and PRMT5 simultaneously engage the protein substrate, orienting its targeted arginine to the catalytic site.",0,582

However, it was not clear what the molecular mechanisms were promoting these GR programming changes or if these changes occurred in arsenic-exposed females. In the present studies, we assessed the effects of arsenic on protein and mRNA of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd) isozymes and compared the levels of methylation within the promoters of the Nr3c1 and Hsd11b1 genes in female fetal brain at embryonic days (E) 14 and 18. Prenatal arsenate exposure produced sex specific effects on the glucocorticoid system. Compared to males, females were resistant to arsenic induced changes in GR, 11beta-Hsd-1 and 11beta-Hsd-2 protein levels despite observed elevations in Nr3c1 and Hsd11b2 mRNA. This sex-specific effect was not due to differences in the methylation of the GR promoter as methylation of the Nr3c1 gene was either unchanged (region containing the egr-1 binding site) or similarly reduced (region containing the SP-1 transcription factor binding site) in both males and females exposed to arsenic. Arsenic did produce sex and age-specific changes in the methylation of Hsd11b1 gene, producing increased methylation in females at E14 and decreased methylation at E18. These changes were not attributed to changes in DNMT levels. Since arsenate metabolism could interfere with the generation of methyl donor groups, we assessed glutathione (GSH), s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and As 3 methyltransferase (As3MT). Exposed males and females had similar levels of As3MT and SAM; however, females had higher levels of GSH/GSSH. It is possible that this greater anti-oxidative capacity within the females provides protection against low to moderate arsenate. Our data suggest that the GR signaling system in female offspring was not as affected by prenatal arsenic and predicts that female arsenic-exposed mice should have normal GR feedback regulation.",0,1749

The ability of both bacteria for reducing iron was tested, and Fe(III) reduction occurred with the highest rate when ferric oxyhydroxide was used as a terminal electron acceptor. G. sulfurreducens had proven to mediate the production of methylmercury (MeHg), and a notable increase of MeHg following the addition of inorganic Hg was observed. When the initial concentration of HgCl2 was 500nM, about 177.03nM of MeHg was determined at 8d after G. sulfurreducens inoculation. S. oneidensis was tested negligible for Hg methylation and only 12.06nM of MeHg was determined. Iron reduction could potentially influence Hg methylation rates. The increase in MeHg was consistent with high rate of iron reduction, indicating that Fe(III) reduction stimulated the formation of MeHg. Furthermore, the net MeHg concentration increased at low Fe(III) additions from 1.78 to 3.57mM, and then decreased when the added Fe(III) was high from 7.14 to 17.85mM. The mercury methylation rate was suppressed with high Fe(III) additions, which might have been attributable to mercury complexation and low availability.",3.34,86

The endosperm genomic DNA hypomethylation has been identified in angiosperm, but it is difficult to dissect the mechanism of how this hypomethylation is established and maintained because endosperm is ephemeral and disappears with seed development in most dicots. Castor bean (Ricinus communis), unlike Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), endosperm is persistent throughout seed development, providing an excellent model in which to dissect the mechanism of endosperm genomic hypomethylation in dicots. We characterized the DNA methylation-related genes encoding DNA methyltransferases and demethylases and analyzed their expression profiles in different tissues. We examined genomic methylation including CG, CHG, and CHH contexts in endosperm and embryo tissues using bisulfite sequencing and revealed that the CHH methylation extent in endosperm and embryo was, unexpectedly, substantially higher than in previously studied plants, irrespective of the CHH percentage in their genomes. In particular, we found that the endosperm exhibited a global reduction in CG and CHG methylation extents relative to the embryo, markedly switching global gene expression. However, CHH methylation occurring in endosperm did not exhibit a significant reduction. Combining with the expression of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mapped within transposable element (TE) regions and genes involved in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, we demonstrate that the 24-nucleotide siRNAs played a critical role in maintaining CHH methylation and repressing the activation of TEs in persistent endosperm development. This study discovered a novel genomic DNA methylation pattern and proposes the potential mechanism occurring in dicot seeds with persistent endosperm.",6.841,1037

Here, we report a method that enables more accurate methylation analysis, by rebuilding bisulfite-damaged components of a DNA library. This recovery after bisulfite treatment (ReBuilT) approach enables PCR-free bisulfite sequencing from low nanogram quantities of genomic DNA. We apply the ReBuilT method for the first whole methylome analysis of the highly AT-rich genome of Plasmodium berghei.

Analysis of DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism that can regulate gene expression, could help to explain racial differences in breast tumor clinical biology and outcomes. METHODS: DNA methylation was evaluated at 1,287 CpGs in the promoters of cancer-related genes in 517 breast tumors of AA (n = 216) or non-AA (n = 301) cases in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression analysis of all tumors, controlling for age, menopausal status, stage, intrinsic subtype, and multiple comparisons [false discovery rate (FDR)], identified seven CpG probes that showed significant (adjusted P < 0.05) differential methylation between AAs and non-AAs. Stratified analyses detected an additional four CpG probes differing by race within hormone receptor-negative (HR(-)) tumors. Genes differentially methylated by race included DSC2, KCNK4, GSTM1, AXL, DNAJC15, HBII-52, TUSC3, and TES; the methylation state of several of these genes may be associated with worse survival in AAs. TCGA breast tumor data confirmed the differential methylation by race and negative correlations with expression for most of these genes. Several loci also showed racial differences in methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from CBCS cases, indicating that these variations were not necessarily tumor-specific. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in the methylation of cancer-related genes are detectable in both tumors and PBLs from breast cancer cases. IMPACT: Epigenetic variation could contribute to differences in breast tumor development and outcomes between AAs and non-AAs.",2.711,508

With lipid oversupply, increases in NRF-1, NRF-2, PPARalpha, and PPARdelta expression were dampened in skeletal muscle from severely obese compared with lean women. The expression of genes downstream of the PPARs and NRFs also exhibited a pattern of not increasing as robustly upon lipid exposure with obesity. Increases in CpG methylation near the transcription start site with lipid oversupply were positively related to PPARdelta expression; increases in methylation with lipid were depressed in HSkMC from severely obese women. With severe obesity, there is an impaired ability to upregulate global transcriptional regulators of FAO in response to lipid exposure. Transient changes in DNA methylation patterns and differences in the methylation signature with severe obesity may play a role in the transcriptional regulation of PPARdelta in response to lipid. The persistence of differential responses to lipid in HSkMC derived from lean and obese subjects supports the possibility of stable epigenetic programming of skeletal muscle cells by the respective environments.",2.374,398

These modifiers also control methylation levels of various non-histone proteins, such as effector proteins that play critical roles in cellular signaling networks. Dysregulated histone methylation modifiers alter expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and change methylation states of effector proteins, frequently resulting in aberrant cellular signaling cascades and cellular transformation. In this review, we summarize the role of histone methylation modifiers in regulating the following signaling pathways: NF-kappaB, RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Wnt/beta-catenin, p53, and ERalpha.",5.808,8

In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation and gene expression profiles at successive human thymus developmental stages. Gain and loss of methylation occurred during thymocyte differentiation, but DNA demethylation was much more frequent than de novo methylation and more strongly correlated with gene expression. These changes took place in CpG-poor regions and were closely associated with T-cell differentiation and TCR function. Up to 88 genes that encode transcriptional regulators, some of whose functions in T-cell development are as yet unknown, were differentially methylated during differentiation. Interestingly, no reversion of accumulated DNA methylation changes was observed as differentiation progressed, except in a very small subset of key genes (RAG1, RAG2, CD8A, PTCRA, etc.), indicating that methylation changes are mostly unique and irreversible events. Our study explores the contribution of DNA methylation to T-cell lymphopoiesis and provides a fine-scale map of differentially methylated regions associated with gene expression changes. These can lay the molecular foundations for a better interpretation of the regulatory networks driving human thymopoiesis.",9.112,1599

The aim of this study was to evaluate DNA methylation profiles according to liquid-based Pap (LBP) test results and to assess their diagnostic value in a Korean population. METHODS: A total of 205 patients with various Papanicolaou test results were enrolled to this study (negative, 26; atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 39; low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 44; high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 48; and cancer, 48). DNA methylation analysis of four genes, ADCYAP1, PAX1, MAL, and CADM1, was performed on residual cervical cells from LBP samples using a quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing method. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the four methylated genes for cancer detection, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn. Sensitivities and specificities were also tested at cutoffs determined from the ROC curves. RESULTS: Cervical cancer cells showed dramatically increased methylation levels for the four genes analyzed. ADCYAP1 and PAX1 also trended toward elevated methylation levels in HSIL samples, although the levels were much lower than those in cancer cells. The sensitivities of methylated ADCYAP1, PAX1, MAL, and CADM1 for the detection of cancer were 79.2%, 75.0%, 70.8%, and 52.1%, and the specificities were 92.0%, 94.0%, 94.7%, and 94.0%, respectively. Methylated ADCYAP1 and PAX1 demonstrated relatively better discriminatory ability than did methylated MAL and CADM1 (area under the curves 0.911 and 0.916 vs. 0.854 and 0.756, respectively). CONCLUSION: DNA methylation status, especially in the ADCYAP1 and PAX1 genes, showed relatively good specificity, ranging from 90% to 94%. The possible additive and complementary roles of DNA methylation testing with respect to conventional cervical cancer screening programs will need to be validated in prospective population-based studies.",2.494,964

Therefore, this study aims at establishing novel prognostic tumor DNA methylation biomarkers. In total, 396 low- and high-risk primary tumors were analyzed, of which 87 were profiled using methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) sequencing for differential methylation analysis between prognostic patient groups. Subsequently, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays were developed for 78 top-ranking differentially methylated regions and tested on two independent cohorts of 132 and 177 samples, respectively. Further, a new statistical framework was used to identify a robust set of MSP assays of which the methylation score (i.e. the percentage of methylated assays) allows accurate outcome prediction. Survival analyses were performed on the individual target level, as well as on the combined multimarker signature. As a result of the differential DNA methylation assessment by MBD sequencing, 58 of the 78 MSP assays were designed in regions previously unexplored in neuroblastoma, and 36 are located in non-promoter or non-coding regions. In total, 5 individual MSP assays (located in CCDC177, NXPH1, lnc-MRPL3-2, lnc-TREX1-1 and one on a region from chromosome 8 with no further annotation) predict event-free survival and 4 additional assays (located in SPRED3, TNFAIP2, NPM2 and CYYR1) also predict overall survival. Furthermore, a robust 58-marker methylation signature predicting overall and event-free survival was established.

Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, we obtained a chronological profile of the genome-wide DNA methylation status in a human myoblast differentiation model, where myoblasts were cultured in low-serum medium to stimulate myogenic differentiation. As the differentiation of the myoblasts proceeded, their global DNA methylation level increased and their methylation patterns became more distinct from those of mesenchymal stem cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes whose promoter region was hypermethylated upon myoblast differentiation were highly significantly enriched with muscle-related terms such as 'muscle contraction' and 'muscle system process'. Sequence motif analysis identified 8-bp motifs somewhat similar to the binding motifs of ID4 and ZNF238 to be most significantly enriched in hypermethylated promoter regions. ID4 and ZNF238 have been shown to be critical transcriptional regulators of muscle-related genes during myogenic differentiation. An integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles revealed that de novo DNA methylation of non-CpG island (CGI) promoters was more often associated with transcriptional down-regulation than that of CGI promoters. These results strongly suggest the existence of an epigenetic mechanism in which DNA methylation modulates the functions of key transcriptional factors to coordinately regulate muscle-related genes during myogenic differentiation.",6.393,1180

An aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachment results in chromosome instability, which leads to cellular transformation or apoptosis. In this article, we show that ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) is necessary for correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Depletion of UBAP2L inhibited chromosome alignment in metaphase and delayed progression to anaphase by activating spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. In addition, UBAP2L knockdown increased side-on attachment of kinetochores along the microtubules and suppressed stable kinetochore fiber formation. A proteomics analysis identified protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)1 as a direct interaction partner of UBAP2L. UBAP2L has an arginine- and glycine-rich motif called the RGG/RG or GAR motif in the N terminus. Biochemical analysis confirmed that arginine residues in the RGG/RG motif of UBAP2L were directly methylated by PRMT1. Finally, we demonstrated that the RGG/RG motif of UBAP2L is essential for the proper alignment of chromosomes in metaphase for the accurate distribution of chromosomes. Our results show a possible role for arginine methylation in UBAP2L for the progression of mitosis.",0,1066

We evaluated methylation levels at promoter regions of candidate genes in biological ageing pathways (SIRT1, TP53, PPARG, PPARGC1A, and TFAM), a subtelomeric region (D4Z4) and the mitochondrial genome (MT-RNR1, D-loop). METHODS: Ninety individuals were randomly chosen from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort to evaluate methylation concordance between cord blood and placenta using highly quantitative bisulfite-PCR pyrosequencing. In a subset of nineteen individuals, a more extensive sampling scheme was performed to examine within-placenta variation. RESULTS: The DNA methylation levels of the subtelomeric region and mitochondrial genome showed concordance between cord blood and placenta with correlation coefficients ranging from r = 0.31 to 0.43, p </= 0.005, and also between the maternal and foetal sides of placental tissue (r = 0.53 to 0.72, p </= 0.05). For the majority of targets, an agreement in methylation levels between four foetal biopsies was found (with intra-class correlation coefficients ranging from 0.16 to 0.72), indicating small within-placenta variation. CONCLUSIONS: The methylation levels of the subtelomeric region (D4Z4) and mitochondrial genome (MT-RNR1, D-loop) showed concordance between cord blood and placenta, suggesting a common epigenetic signature of these targets between tissues. Concordance was lacking between the other genes that were studied.

Yet, our understanding of this relationship can contribute significant knowledge on how and why organisms target specific gene bodies for methylation. Here, we studied gene body methylation patterns in two Daphnia species. We observed both highly methylated genes and genes devoid of methylation in a background of low global methylation levels. A small but highly significant number of genes was highly methylated in both species. Remarkably, functional analyses indicate that variation in methylation within and between Daphnia species is primarily targeted to small gene families whereas large gene families tend to lack variation. The degree of sequence similarity could not explain the observed pattern. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between gene family size and the degree of methylation suggests that gene body methylation may help regulate gene family expansion and functional diversification of gene families leading to phenotypic variation.",4.229,851

Reciprocal triploid F1 isogenic plants generated from interploidy crosses in the same genetic background allow investigation on parent-of-origin-specific (parental) genome-dosage effects without confounding effects of hybridity involving heterozygous mutations. Whole-genome transcriptome profiling was conducted on reciprocal F1 isogenic triploid (3x) seedlings of A. thaliana. The genetically identical reciprocal 3x genotypes had either an excess of maternally inherited 3x(m) or paternally inherited 3x(p) genomes. We identify a major parent-of-origin-dependent genome-dosage effect on transcript levels, whereby 602 genes exhibit differential expression between the reciprocal F1 triploids. In addition, using methylation-sensitive DNA tiling arrays, constitutive and polymorphic CG DNA methylation patterns at CCGG sites were analysed, which revealed that paternal-excess F1 triploid seedling C(m)CGG sites are overall hypermethylated. However, no correlation exists between C(m)CGG methylation polymorphisms and transcriptome dysregulation between the isogenic reciprocal F1 triploids. Overall, our study indicates that parental genome-dosage effects on the transcriptome levels occur in paternal-excess triploids, which are independent of C(m)CGG methylation polymorphisms. Such findings have implications for understanding parental effects and genome-dosage effects on gene expression and phenotypes in polyploid plants.",0,1797

METHODS: The DNMT3b was genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 108 sporadic CRC patients and 185 healthy controls and methylation of genes' promoter was determined by methylation specific PCR. RESULTS: In comparison to controls, the TT genotype was strongly associated with a high risk of cancer incidence (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.6-6.9). The frequency of methylated hMLH1 was significantly higher in patients with the DNMT3bCT genotype (p= 0.03), especially in male subjects. The frequency of hMLH1 methylation was significantly higher in young patients (< 60 years) with the CT/TT genotypes. The combined CT/TT genotypes also showed significant associations with the ECAD methylation in the entire group of patients (p= 0.04), in patients with distal tumors, and in old cases. The DNMT3b genotype was not associated with methylation of other genes examined in this study.

STUDY DESIGN: HPV16 DNA methylation, integration and gene expression were assessed using pyrosequencing, ligation-mediated PCR and QPCR, in biopsies from 25 patients attending a specialist vulval neoplasia clinic and in short-term clonal cell lines derived from vulval and vaginal neoplasia. RESULTS: Increased methylation of the HPV16 L1/L2 and E2 regions was associated with integration of viral DNA into the host genome. This relationship was observed both in vivo and in vitro. Increased methylation of E2 binding sites did not appear to be associated with greater expression of viral early genes. Expression of HPV E6 and E7 did not correlate with either integration state or increased L1/L2 methylation.

Recent studies have revealed widespread associations between genetic variation and methylation levels. However, the mechanistic links between genetic variation and methylation remain unclear. To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at  approximately 300,000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide bisulfite sequence data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10%) 13,915 cis methylation QTLs (meQTLs)-i.e., CpG sites in which changes in DNA methylation are associated with genetic variation at proximal loci. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes in all of these regulatory phenotypes. One plausible driver of coordinated changes in different regulatory mechanisms is variation in transcription factor (TF) binding. Indeed, we found that SNPs that change predicted TF binding affinities are significantly enriched for associations with DNA methylation at nearby CpGs.",7.528,1892

Insulin-like growth factor 2 and H19 are two of the imprinted candidate genes that are involved in fetal growth and development. Change in methylation at differentially methylated region of the insulin-like growth factor 2 and H19 has been proved to be an early event related to the programming of metabolic profile, including macrosomia and small for gestational age in offspring. Here we hypothesize that alteration in methylation at differentially methylated region of the insulin-like growth factor 2 and H19 is associated with macrosomia induced by intrauterine hyperglycemia. RESULTS: The expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 is significant higher in gestational diabetes mellitus group (GDM group) compared to normal glucose tolerance group (NGT group) both in umbilical cord blood and placenta, while the expression of H19 is significant lower in GDM group in umbilical cord blood. The expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 is significant higher in normal glucose tolerance with macrosomia group (NGT-M) compared to normal glucose tolerance with normal birthweight group (NGT-NBW group) both in placenta and umbilical cord blood. A model with interaction term of gene expression of IGF2 and H19 found that IGF2 and the joint action of IGF2 and H19 in placenta showed significantly relationship with GDM/NGT and GDM-NBW/NGT-NBW. A borderline significant association was seen among IGF2 and H19 in cord blood and GDM-M/NGT-M. The methylation level at different CpG sites of insulin-like growth factor 2 and H19 in umbilical cord blood was also significantly different among groups. Based on the multivariable linear regression analysis, the methylation of the insulin-like growth factor 2 / H19 is closely related to birth weight and intrauterine hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the existence of alteration in DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia and reported a functional role in regulating gene associated with insulin-like growth factor 2/H19.

We show that Vcpkmt is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined and confirm the sub-cellular localization to the cytoplasm. We show by (I) mass spectrometric analysis, (II) VCPKMT-mediated in vitro methylation of VCP in cell extracts and (III) immunostaining with a methylation specific antibody, that in Vcpkmt-/- mice the methylation of lysine 315 in VCP is completely abolished.

Furthermore, we investigated the specificity of VCPKMT with in vitro methylation assays using as source of substrate protein extracts from Vcpkmt-/- mouse organs or three human Vcpkmt-/- cell lines. The results show that VCPKMT is a highly specific enzyme, and suggest that VCP is its sole substrate. The Vcpkmt-/- mice were viable, fertile and had no obvious pathological phenotype.

 Society of Hypertension",2015,"Angiotensinogen (AGT) has a central role in maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. DNA methylation is an epigenomic modification maintaining a steady pattern in somatic cells. Herein we summarize the link between AGT regulation and DNA methylation. DNA methylation negatively regulates AGT expression and dynamically changes in response to continuous AGT promoter stimulation. High-salt intake and excess circulating aldosterone cause DNA demethylation around the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-binding sites, thereby converting the phenotype of AGT expression from an inactive to an active state in visceral adipose tissue. Salt-dependent hypertension may be partially affected by increased adipose AGT expression. Because angiotensin II is a well-established aldosterone-releasing hormone, stimulation of adipose AGT by aldosterone creates a positive feedback loop. This effect is pathologically associated with obesity-related hypertension, although it would be physiologically favorable for humans to efficiently retain their body fluid. The clear difference in DNA demethylation patterns between aldosterone and cortisol indicates a difference in the respective target DNA-binding sites between mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in the AGT promoter. Stimulation-induced interactions between transcription factors and target DNA-binding sites trigger DNA demethylation. Dynamic changes in DNA methylation occur in relaxed chromatin regions both where transcription factors actively interact and where transcription is initiated. In contrast to rapid histone modifications, DNA demethylation and remethylation will progress relatively slowly over days or years. A wide variety of stimuli in daily life will continue to slowly and dynamically change DNA methylation patterns throughout life. Wise choices of beneficial stimuli will improve health.",2.658,1075

The present review aims to summarize current knowledge on the link between DNA methylation and physical activity in humans. We have critically reviewed the literature and only papers focused on physical activity and its influence on DNA methylation status were included; a total of 25 papers were selected. We concluded that both acute and chronic exercises significantly impact DNA methylation, in a highly tissue- and gene-specific manner. This review also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of exercise-induced DNA methylation changes, and recommendations for future research.",1.584,837
26690922,Methylation of C9orf72 expansion reduces RNA foci formation and dipeptide-repeat proteins expression in cells.,['Bauer PO'],Neuroscience letters,2016,"A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), together referred to as c9FTD/ALS. It has been suggested that a loss of C9orf72 protein expression, the formation of toxic RNA foci and dipeptide-repeat proteins contribute to C9orf72-related diseases. Interestingly, it has been shown that trimethylation of histones and methylation of CpG islands near the repeat expansion may play a role in the pathogenesis c9FTD/ALS. Recently, methylation of expanded repeat itself has been reported. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these diseases, the influence of epigenetic modification in the repeat expansion on its pathogenic effect was assessed. Here, a reduced formation of toxic RNA foci and dipeptide-repeat proteins upon methylation of the GGGGCC repeat in a cellular model of c9FTD/ALS is shown. Additionally, a novel methylcytosine-capture DNA hybridization immunoassay for semi-quantitative detection of the repeat methylation levels is presented, potentially usable for methylation analysis in patients carrying C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers as a diagnostic tool. Presented results suggest that increased level of pathogenic GGGGCC expansion methylation may be sufficient to alleviate the molecular pathology of the C9orf72-related diseases.",2.03,82

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laryngeal cancer and normal laryngeal mucosa specimens were obtained from our paraffin block archives, and then subjected to pyrosequencing. Different cut-off values were used to detect methylation. Clinicopathological data for the patients that provided specimens were obtained from archive records. RESULTS: When 5% was used as the cut-off value, 78% of the laryngeal cancer specimens (64 of 82), and 27.3% of normal laryngeal mucosa specimens (3 of 11) were considered methylated. When 10% was used as the cut-off value, 47% of the laryngeal cancer specimens (39 of 82), and none of the normal laryngeal mucosa specimens were considered methylated. There was not a significant relationship between the methylation status of MGMT, and clinicopathological parameters, including age, tumor stage, histopathological differentiation, chemoradiotherapy protocol used, recurrence, or disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing is a reliable semiquantitative technique that can be used to detect the methylation pattern. Methylation was common in the laryngeal cancer specimens, but there was not a significant relationship between the methylation status of MGMT and clinicopathological parameters.",1.397,722

Among these markers, a predictive value was reported in glioblastomas (GBM) for MGMT promoter methylation, in particular in elderly GBM patients. In this study, methylation data from 46 glioma samples with the Illumina 450K platform were obtained and extended using external data to include a total of 247 glioma samples. Methylation analysis of the whole MGMT gene with this platform revealed two strongly survival-associated CpG regions within the promoter and the gene body, which were confirmed in a reported dataset of high grade-gliomas. Methylation at the promoter (CpG 25, cg12981137 and the prognostic model MGMT-STP27) and at the gene body CpG 165 (cg07933035), were significantly associated with better overall survival, and strongly correlated with G-CIMP+ status. In this series, the prognostic value of MGMT methylation at the promoter was not observed in G-CIMP- cases, although around 50 % of them were MGMT-methylated. These results were also obtained in an homogeneously-treated series of chemoradiated G-CIMP- GBMs analyzed by MSP and qMSP, and confirmed in a reported pyrosequencing-analyzed series of gliomas. Interestingly, in contrast to the MGMT promoter, gene body methylation was of prognostic value in G-CIMP-patients older than 65 years. Our study highlights the relevance of the prognostic value of the different regions of methylation throughout the MGMT gene that could be affected by specific G-CIMP profiles and age groups.",3.07,621

Considering the low transformation efficiency of soybean, we aimed to determine the effect of 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA), shoot induction time, and infection time of Agrobacterium on the clonal propagation of Glycine max. Results showed that 1.6 mg/L 6-BA could be optimal to promote the induction of adventitious shoots. An induction time of 15 d was considered optimal for the actual experiment involving soybean shoot induction. Agrobacterium was cultured until an OD600 = 0.8 was reached for an infection time of 30 min; this infection time may be optimal to promote soybean transformation. Whole genome DNA methylation was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-assisted quantification, and DNA methylation result is consistent with the phenotypic data of shoot development. In addition, two methylation-related genes (Decrease in DNA methylation 1 and DNA methyltransferases chromomethylase 2) were analyzed to determine expression differences by qRT-PCR in the shoots that were developed under different experimental conditions. In general, the expression values of these genes were normally downregulated under the recommended experimental conditions of soybean regeneration. This study showed the overall methylation changes in the in vitro culture of soybean, as affected by several variable parameters, which is useful to promote the transformation efficiency of soybean.",0.347,282

RUNX1 expression is essential for the initiation of definitive haematopoiesis, for steady-state thrombopoiesis, and for normal lymphocytes development. Recent studies revealed that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which accounts for the majority of the type I PRMT activity in cells, methylates two arginine residues in RUNX1 (R206 and R210), and these modifications inhibit corepressor-binding to RUNX1 thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity. In order to elucidate the biological significance of these methylations, we established novel knock-in mouse lines with non-methylable, double arginine-to-lysine (RTAMR-to-KTAMK) mutations in RUNX1. Homozygous Runx1(KTAMK) (/) (KTAMK) mice are born alive and appear normal during adulthood. However, Runx1(KTAMK) (/) (KTAMK) mice showed a reduction in CD3(+) T lymphoid cells and a decrease in CD4(+) T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs, in comparison to their wild-type littermates, leading to a reduction in the CD4(+) to CD8(+) T-cell ratio. These findings suggest that arginine-methylation of RUNX1 in the RTAMR-motif is dispensable for the development of definitive haematopoiesis and for steady-state platelet production, however this modification affects the role of RUNX1 in the maintenance of the peripheral CD4(+) T-cell population.",4.711,570

At the early landfill stage, the total mercury (THg) and the monomethyl mercury (MMHg) released rapidly and significantly, the THg concentration of the semi-aerobic landfill leachate was obviously higher than that of the anaerobic landfill leachate, while compared with the semi-aerobic landfill, the MMHg concentration in the anaerobic landfill was higher. As the landfill time increased, both of THg and MMHg concentration decreased quickly, the THg concentration in the anaerobic landfill was much higher than that in semi-aerobic landfill, while the MMHg concentration in the anaerobic landfill was lower than that in the semi-aerobic landfill. Generally, the concentrations of dimethyl mercury (DMHg) in the anaerobic landfill leachate were slightly higher than in the semi-aerobic landfill leachate during the stabilization process. A significant positive correlation was found between the DMHg concentrations and the pH value in anaerobic landfill leachate, but this correlation was opposite in the semi-aerobic landfill. The oxidative-reductive potential (ORP) condition was found to be the controlling factor of the methylation process during the early stage. However, the chemical characteristics, especially the TOC concentration, appeared to be the dominant factor affecting the methylation process as the landfill time increased.",3.34,477

One group displayed hypermethylation of a developmental promoter set, genome-wide demethylation, increased proliferation and activity of the SWI/SNF complex. A second group had a methylation pattern resembling stromal and leukocyte cells, over-expressed an immune signature and had improved survival rates in metastatic tumors (p < 0.05).

Until now, however, no methylation alterations of target genes have been connected with congenital hydrocephalus in humans. Frizzled 3(FZD3) is a planar cell polarity (PCP) gene required for PCP signaling. Partial restoration of frizzled 3 activities in FZD3 mutant mice results in hydrocephalus. To analyze the possible roles of epigenetic modifications of the FZD3 gene in congenital hydrocephalus pathogenesis, DNA methylation in the promoter region of FZD3 was assayed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility were also determined to assess the role of methylation alterations. Our study found methylation levels of the FZD3 gene were increased in congenital hydrocephalus, especially in males (10.57 +/- 3.90 vs. 7.08 +/- 0.94, p=0.001). Hypermethylation of FZD3 increased congenital hydrocephalus risk, with an odds ratio of 10.125 (p=0.003). Aberrant methylation modification of FZD3 altered both chromatin structure in this region and FZD3 expression levels. Totally, aberrant methylation modification of the FZD3 gene increases the risk of congenital hydrocephalus by altering chromatin structure and disturbing gene expression.",2.843,1953

We sought to investigate the biological significance of DNA methylation in lung cancer. RESULTS: We integrated the gene expression profiles and data of gene promoter methylation for a large panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, and identified 578 candidate genes with expression levels that were inversely correlated to the degree of DNA methylation. We found these candidate genes to be differentially methylated in normal lung tissue versus non-small cell lung cancer tumors, and segregated by histologic and tumor subtypes. We used gene set enrichment analysis of the genes ranked by the degree of correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation to identify gene sets involved in cellular migration and metastasis. Our unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the candidate genes segregated cell lines according to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype. Genes related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, such as AXL, ESRP1, HoxB4, and SPINT1/2, were among the nearly 20% of the candidate genes that were differentially methylated between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Greater numbers of genes were methylated in the mesenchymal cells and their expressions were upregulated by 5-azacytidine treatment. Methylation of the candidate genes was associated with erlotinib resistance in wild-type EGFR cell lines. The expression profiles of the candidate genes were associated with 8-week disease control in patients with wild-type EGFR who had unresectable non-small cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib, but not in patients treated with sorafenib.

Evidence suggests mercury exposure may alter DNA methylation levels, but to date, the effects in early life on a genome-wide scale have not been investigated. METHODS: A study sample of 141 newborns was recruited in Baltimore, MD, USA and total mercury and methylmercury were measured in cord blood samples. We quantified genome-wide DNA methylation data using CHARM 2.0, an array-based method, and used region-finding analyses to identify concentration-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs). To test for replication of these identified DMRs in the pilot, or Vanguard, phase of the National Children's Study (NCS), we compared bisulfite-pyrosequenced DNA at candidate regions from 85 whole cord blood samples with matched first trimester maternal mercury concentration measures. RESULTS: Total mercury concentration was associated with methylation at DMRs inside ANGPT2 and near PRPF18 genes [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05], as well as DMRs near FOXD2 and within TCEANC2 (FDR< 0.1) genes. Methylmercury concentration was associated with an overlapping DMR within TCEANC2 (FDR< 0.05). In NCS replication analyses, methylation levels at three of four cytosine-guanine DNA dinucleotides (CpG sites) within the TCEANC2 DMR were associated with total mercury concentration (P < 0.05), and this association was diminished after adjusting for estimated cell proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for an association between mercury and DNA methylation at the TCEANC2 region was found, which may represent a mercury-associated shift in cord blood cell composition or a change in methylation within blood cell types.

Premature aging and disturbed methylation are components of Down syndrome (DS). We studied blood biomarkers and DNA methylation (DNAm) of three CpG sites (ASPA, ITGA2B, and PDE4C) in 60 elderly subjects (mean age = 68 years), 31 subjects with DS (12.1 years) and 44 controls (12.8 years). Plasma concentrations of amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 and biomarkers of methylation were measured in the young groups. Subjects with DS had significantly higher concentrations of plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and Abeta and reduced S-adenosylmethionine/SAH ratio compared with the controls. Methylations (%) of ASPA and ITGA2B were lower in DS [mean difference; 95 % confidence intervals = -2.2 (-4.5, 0.1) for ASPA and -5.0 (-8.9, -1.1) for ITGA2B]. Methylation of PDE4C did not differ between the groups. The sum of z-scores for methylations of ASPA and ITGA2B, both of which declined with age, was significantly lower in DS [-1.01 (-1.93, -0.20), p = 0.017]. Subjects with DS were found to be 3.1 (1.5-4.6) years older than their predicted age based on a regression model of the controls. Elevated SAH levels predicted lower DNAm of ASPA and ITGA2B in stepwise regression analysis. Therefore, methylation of three CpGs combined with plasma Abeta has shown a 3-year accelerated aging in subjects with DS at the age of 12 years. Disorders in the methylation cycle explained pathoepigenetic modifications in subjects with DS. The influence of modifications in the methylation cycle on epigenetic markers of aging warrants further investigations.",3.678,717

Endothelial Kruppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) is an important anti-inflammatory atheroprotective transcription factor that is suppressed in regions of DF. OBJECTIVE: The plasticity of epigenomic KLF4 transcriptional regulation by flow-mediated DNA methylation was investigated in vitro and in arterial tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: To recapitulate dominant flow characteristics of atheroprotected and atherosusceptible arteries, human aortic endothelial cells were subjected to pulsatile undisturbed flow or oscillatory DF containing a flow-reversing phase. Differential CpG site methylation was measured by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, bisulfite pyrosequencing, and restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. The methylation profiles of endothelium from disturbed and undisturbed flow sites of adult swine aortas were also investigated. In vitro, DF increased DNA methylation of CpG islands within the KLF4 promoter that significantly contributed to suppression of KLF4 transcription; the effects were mitigated by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and knockdown of DNMT3A. Contributory mechanisms included DF-induced increase of DNMT3A protein (1.7-fold), DNMT3A enrichment (11-fold) on the KLF4 promoter, and competitive blocking of a myocyte enhancer factor-2 binding site in the KLF4 promoter near the transcription start site. DF also induced DNMT-sensitive propathological expression of downstream KLF4 transcription targets nitric oxide synthase 3, thrombomodulin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In support of the in vitro findings, swine aortic endothelium isolated from DF regions expressed significantly lower KLF4 and nitric oxide synthase 3, and bisulfite sequencing of KLF4 promoter identified a hypermethylated myocyte enhancer factor-2 binding site. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamics influence endothelial KLF4 expression through DNMT enrichment/myocyte enhancer factor-2 inhibition mechanisms of KLF4 promoter CpG methylation with regional consequences for atherosusceptibility.",11.019,1954

It is a common, complex, non-malignant disease and develops due to interactions between the genes and the environment. DNA methylation can act as a downstream effector of environmental signals; analysis of this process therefore holds substantial promise for identifying mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to disease risk. To assess the effects of excessive weight and obesity on gene-specific methylation levels of promoter regions, we determined the methylation status of four genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress [interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and glucose transport 4 (GLUT4)] in blood cell-derived DNA from healthy women volunteers with a range of body mass indices (BMIs) by methylation-specific PCR. Interestingly, the samples from obese individuals (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)) showed significantly increased hypermethylation for IL6 gene compared to normal weight (BMI < 23 kg/m(2)) and overweight samples (23 kg/m(2) </= BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) (P = 0.034 and P = 0.026). However, there was no statistically significant difference in promoter methylation of the other 3 genes between each group. These findings suggest that aberrant DNA methylation of IL6 gene promoter may play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of obesity and IL6 methylation could be used as molecular biomarker for obesity risk assessment. Further studies are required to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.",2.09,382

Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated alterations in methylation of DNA associated with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene within the amygdala and hippocampus of infant and adult rats that were repeatedly exposed to caregiver maltreatment outside the home cage during their first week of life. In the current study we examine changes in global levels of DNA methylation (5-mC) and hydroxymethylation (5-hmC), as well as gene-specific changes in methylation patterns of the candidate gene bdnf (at exons I and IV) within the adolescent amygdala and hippocampus resulting from exposure to maltreatment. While adolescent females exposed to maltreatment showed no significant alterations in global 5-mC or 5-hmC levels, examination of bdnf DNA methylation revealed that maltreated females had greater methylation of exon IV DNA in the amygdala and ventral hippocampus. While adolescent males exposed to maltreatment showed no significant alterations in bdnf DNA methylation, maltreated males had significantly higher 5-mC levels in the dorsal hippocampus and lower 5-hmC levels in the amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the effects of the early caregiving environment are detectable in the adolescent brain at the level of the epigenome, with brain-region specific and sexually-dimorphic epigenetic consequences that could have relevance to adolescent mental health and behavior.",3.028,1092

Array based DNA methylation analysis showed that the impacts of Cr(VI) on DNA methylation were limited, only about 40 differentially methylated CpG sites, with an overlap of 15CpG sites, were induced by both potassium dichromate and lead chromate. The results of mRNA expression showed that after Cr(VI) treatment, mRNA expression changes of four genes (TBL1Y, FZD5, IKZF2, and KIAA1949) were consistent with their DNA methylation alteration, but DNA methylation changes of other six genes did not correlate with mRNA expression. In conclusion, both of soluble and particulate Cr(VI) could induce a small amount of differentially methylated sites in human B lymphoblastoid cells, and the correlations between DNA methylation changes and mRNA expression varied between different genes.",2.415,171

We designed a longitudinal study among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with six repeated health measurements in Shanghai, China. We applied linear mixed-effect models to evaluate the associations. We observed that the inverse association between PM2.5 and methylation at position 1 was limited within 24 h, and the positive association between PM2.5 and FeNO was the strongest at lag 1 day.

In this study, we identified an important posttranslational mechanism by which SREBP1a is regulated during metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Mass spectrometry revealed protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a binding partner of SREBP1a that symmetrically dimethylated it on R321, thereby promoting transcriptional activity. Furthermore, PRMT5-induced methylation prevented phosphorylation of SREBP1a on S430 by GSK3beta, leading to its disassociation from Fbw7 (FBXW7) and its evasion from degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Consequently, methylation-stabilized SREBP1a increased de novo lipogenesis and accelerated the growth of cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Clinically, R321 symmetric dimethylation status was associated with malignant progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma, where it served as an independent risk factor of poor prognosis. By showing how PRMT5-induced methylation of SREBP1a triggers hyperactivation of lipid biosynthesis, a key event in tumorigenesis, our findings suggest a new generalized strategy to selectively attack tumor metabolism.",9.329,138

In males, this involves erasure of the maternal methylation marks and establishment of paternal-specific methylation to appropriately guide normal development.

We previously found an association between paternal obesity and altered DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood, suggesting that the father's endocrine, nutritional, or lifestyle status could potentiate intergenerational heritable epigenetic abnormalities. In these analyses, we examine the relationship between male overweight/obesity and DNA methylation status of imprinted gene regulatory regions in the gametes. METHODS: Linear regression models were used to compare sperm DNA methylation percentages, quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing, at 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from 23 overweight/obese and 44 normal weight men. Our study population included 69 volunteers from The Influence of the Environment on Gametic Epigenetic Reprogramming (TIEGER) study, based in NC, USA. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and fertility patient status, semen from overweight or obese men had significantly lower methylation percentages at the MEG3 (beta = -1.99; SE = 0.84; p = 0.02), NDN (beta = -1.10; SE = 0.47; p = 0.02), SNRPN (beta = -0.65; SE = 0.27; p = 0.02), and SGCE/PEG10 (beta = -2.5; SE = 1.01; p = 0.01) DMRs. Our data further suggest a slight increase in DNA methylation at the MEG3-IG DMR (beta = +1.22; SE = 0.59; p = 0.04) and H19 DMR (beta = +1.37; SE = 0.62; p = 0.03) in sperm of overweight/obese men. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that male overweight/obesity status is traceable in the sperm epigenome. Further research is needed to understand the effect of such changes and the point of origin of DNA methylation differences between lean and overweight/obese men. Together with our earlier reports on paternal obesity and epigenetic shifts in the offspring, our studies set the groundwork for future studies investigating male gametic methylation aberrations due to paternal lifestyle factors such as obesity.",4.543,1250

Protein arginine methylation is a crucial post-translational modification and generates monomethylarginine (MMA) and dimethylarginine (asymmetric, ADMA, and symmetric, SDMA) residues. We aimed at determining whether protein arginine methylation status is disturbed in an animal model of diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). HHcy was achieved by dietary manipulation of Wistar rats: methionine-enrichment (HM), B vitamins deficiency (LV), or both (HMLV). Total Hcy, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), AdoHcy, MMA, ADMA and SDMA concentrations in plasma or tissues (heart, brain and liver) were determined by adequate high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Moreover, in tissues from the HMLV group, histone arginine asymmetric dimethylation was evaluated by Western blotting, and the histone methylation marks H3R17me2a, H3R8me2a and H4R3me2a were studied. HHcy was induced by all special diets, with elevation of AdoHcy concentrations in liver (LV and HMLV) and heart (HMLV) (all versus control). Plasma ADMA levels were lower in all hyperhomocysteinemic animals. Protein-incorporated ADMA levels were decreased in brain and in heart (both for the LV and HMLV groups). Moreover, in brain of animals exposed to the HMLV diet, the H3R8me2a mark was profoundly decreased. In conclusion, our results show that diet-induced Hcy elevation disturbs global protein arginine methylation in a tissue-specific manner and affects histone arginine methylation in brain. Future research is warranted to disclose the functional implications of the global protein and histone arginine hypomethylation triggered by Hcy elevation.",4.381,1497

With methylation data, measured by the Infinium Human Methylation 450 array, from 993 participants (age ranging from 18 to 87 years) in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study, and from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium, combined with published methylation datasets, we described the methylation pattern of 13 CpG sites within APOE locus, their correlations with gene expression across cell types, and their relationships with age, plasma lipids, and sequence variants. Based on methylation levels and the genetic regions, we categorized the 13 APOE CpG sites into three groups: Group 1 showed hypermethylation (> 50%) and were located in the promoter region, Group 2 exhibited hypomethylation (< 50%) and were located in the first two exons and introns, and Group 3 showed hypermethylation (> 50%) and were located in the exon 4. APOE methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression (minimum r = -0.66, P = 0.004). APOE methylation was significantly associated with age (minimum P = 2.06E-08) and plasma total cholesterol (minimum P = 3.53E-03). Finally, APOE methylation patterns differed across APOE epsilon variants (minimum P = 3.51E-05) and the promoter variant rs405509 (minimum P = 0.01), which further showed a significant interaction with age (P = 0.03).

We dissected the role of DNA methylation in trophoblast development by performing mRNA and DNA methylation profiling of Dnmt3a/3b mutants. We find that oocyte-derived methylation plays a major role in regulating trophoblast development but that imprinting of the key placental regulator Ascl2 is only partially responsible for these effects. We have identified several methylation-regulated genes associated with trophoblast differentiation that are involved in cell adhesion and migration, potentially affecting trophoblast invasion. Specifically, trophoblast-specific DNA methylation is linked to the silencing of Scml2, a Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 protein that drives loss of cell adhesion in methylation-deficient trophoblast. Our results reveal that maternal DNA methylation controls multiple differentiation-related and physiological processes in trophoblast via both imprinting-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",9.708,163

Gata3 also directly transactivates the interleukin-5 (Il5) gene via additional mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. We herein identified a mechanism whereby the methylation of Gata3 at Arg-261 regulates the transcriptional activation of the Il5 gene in Th2 cells. Although the methylation-mimicking Gata3 mutant retained the ability to induce IL-4 and repress IFNgamma production, the IL-5 production was selectively impaired. We also demonstrated that heat shock protein (Hsp) 60 strongly associates with the methylation-mimicking Gata3 mutant and negatively regulates elongation of the Il5 transcript by RNA polymerase II. Thus, arginine methylation appears to play a pivotal role in the organization of Gata3 complexes and the target gene specificity of Gata3.",0,1096

To evaluate variability in DNA methylation levels at 8q24 and the relationship with cancer susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region, we quantified DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood at 145 CpG sites nearby 8q24 cancer susceptibility SNPs or MYC using pyrosequencing among 80 Caucasian men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. For the 60 CpG sites meeting quality control, which also demonstrated temporal stability over a 5-year period, we calculated pairwise Spearman correlations for DNA methylation levels at each CpG site with 42 8q24 cancer susceptibility SNPs. To account for multiple testing, we adjusted P values into q values reflecting the false discovery rate (FDR). In contrast to the MYC CpG sites, most sites nearby the SNPs demonstrated good reproducibility, high methylation levels, and moderate-high between-individual variation. We observed 10 statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) CpG site-SNP correlations. These included correlations between an intergenic CpG site at Chr8:128393157 and the prostate cancer SNP rs16902094 (rho = -0.54; P = 9.7 x 10(-7); q = 0.002), a PRNCR1 CpG site at Chr8:128167809 and the prostate cancer SNP rs1456315 (rho = 0.52; P = 1.4 x 10(-6); q = 0.002), and two POU5F1B CpG sites and several prostate/colorectal cancer SNPs (for Chr8:128498051 and rs6983267, rho = 0.46; P = 2.0 x 10(-5); q = 0.01).

Allele-specific DNA methylation of the ICRs is faithfully maintained at the imprinted loci throughout development, even in early embryos where genomes undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming, including DNA demethylation, to acquire totipotency. We previously found that an ectopically introduced H19 ICR fragment in transgenic mice acquired paternal allele-specific methylation in the somatic cells of offspring, whereas it was not methylated in sperm, suggesting that its gametic and postfertilization modifications were separable events. We hypothesized that this latter activity might contribute to maintenance of the methylation imprint in early embryos. Here, we demonstrate that methylation of the paternally inherited transgenic H19 ICR commences soon after fertilization in a maternal DNMT3A- and DNMT3L-dependent manner. When its germline methylation was partially obstructed by insertion of insulator sequences, the endogenous paternal H19 ICR also exhibited postfertilization methylation. Finally, we refined the responsible sequences for this activity in transgenic mice and found that deletion of the 5' segment of the endogenous paternal H19 ICR decreased its methylation after fertilization and attenuated Igf2 gene expression. These results demonstrate that this segment of the H19 ICR is essential for its de novo postfertilization DNA methylation, and that this activity contributes to the maintenance of imprinted methylation at the endogenous H19 ICR during early embryogenesis.",0,126

Herein, we describe eMethylsorb, an electrochemical assay for quantitative detection of regional DNA methylation on a single-use and cost-effective screen-printed gold electrode (SPE-Au) platform. The eMethylsorb approach is based on the inherent differential adsorption affinity of DNA bases to gold (i.e. adenine > cytosine >/= guanine > thymine). Through bisulfite modification and asymmetric PCR of DNA, methylated and unmethylated DNA in the sample becomes guanine-enriched and adenine-enriched respectively. Under optimized conditions, adenine-enriched unmethylated DNA (higher affinity to gold) adsorbs more onto the SPE-Au surface than methylated DNA. Higher DNA adsorption causes stronger coulombic repulsion and hinders reduction of ferricyanide [Fe(CN)6](3-)ions on the SPE-Au surface to give a lower electrochemical response. Hence, the response level is directly proportional to the methylation level in the sample. The applicability of this methodology was tested by detecting the regional methylation status in a cluster of eight CpG sites within the engrailed (EN1) gene promoter of the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. A 10% methylation level sensitivity with good reproducibility (RSD = 5.8%, n = 3) was achieved rapidly in 10 min. Furthermore, eMethylsorb also has advantages over current methylation assays such as being inexpensive, rapid and does not require any electrode surface modification. We thus believe that the eMethylsorb assay could potentially be a rapid and accurate diagnostic assay for point-of-care DNA methylation analysis.",0,1411

The aims of this study are to assess the methylation profile in DCIS for a panel of well-characterized genes that are frequently methylated in breast cancer, to investigate the relationship of methylation with pathological features, and to perform a proof-of-principle study to evaluate the practicality of methylation as a biomarker in diagnostic DCIS material. METHODS: Promoter CpG island methylation for a panel of 11 breast cancer-related genes was performed by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies from 72 samples of pure DCIS (DCIS occurring in the absence of synchronous invasive carcinoma), 10 samples of mixed DCIS (DCIS adjacent to invasive carcinoma), and 18 samples of normal breast epithelium adjacent to a DCIS lesion were micro-dissected prior to DNA extraction. RESULTS: Methylation was seen for all the tested genes except BRCA1. RASSF1A was the most frequently methylated gene (90% of DCIS samples) and its methylation was associated with comedo necrosis (p = 0.018). Cluster analysis based on the methylation profile revealed four groups, the highly methylated cluster being significantly associated with high nuclear grade, HER2 amplification, negative estrogen receptor (ER) alpha status, and negative progesterone receptor (PgR) status, (p = 0.038, p = 0.018, p <0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). Methylation of APC (p = 0.017), CDH13 (p = 0.017), and RARbeta (p <0.001) was associated with negative ERalpha status. Methylation of CDH13 (p <0.001), and RARbeta (p = 0.001) was associated with negative PgR status. Methylation of APC (p = 0.013) and CDH13 (p = 0.026) was associated with high nuclear grade. Methylation of CDH13 (p = 0.009), and RARbeta (p = 0.042) was associated with HER2-amplification. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation can be assessed in FFPE-derived samples using suitable methodologies. Methylation of a panel of genes that are known to be methylated in invasive breast cancer was able to classify DCIS into distinct groups and was differentially associated with phenotypic features in DCIS.",1.585,1689

The methylation of SFRP1, SFRP2, PPP2R2B, DKK1, SOX17, and DACH1 was analyzed in 64 glioma samples using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The results were analyzed in correlation with clinicopathological data. Promoter methylation in at least one of the analyzed genes was found in 81.3 % of the tumors. All benign tumors [grade I according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification] lacked the methylation of the studied genes, whereas grade II, III, and IV tumors were, in most cases, methylation-positive. The methylation index correlated with the patient's age. The most frequently methylated genes were SFRP1 and SFRP2 (73.4 % and 46.9 %, respectively), followed by SOX17 (20.3 %) and PPP2R2B (10.9 %); DKK1 and DACH1 were basically unmethylated (1.6 %). SFRP1 methylation negatively correlated with patients' survival time, and was significantly more frequent in older patients and those with higher grade tumors. Overall, the results of this study indicate that aberrant promoter methylation of Wnt pathway antagonists is common in gliomas, which may be the possible cause of up-regulation of this signaling pathway often observed in these tumors.

METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 92 cases of different cervical lesions during March 2011 to August 2012 treated in our hospital were collected. There were pathologically confirmed 10 cases of normal cervix, 26 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 20 cases of CIN II, 15 cases of CIN III, and 21 cases of cervical cancer. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to detect the TSLC1 gene methylation status in cervical lesions, immunohistochemistry (SP) was used to detect the expressions of TSLC1 protein in cervical lesions, and the second generation hybrid capture (HC2) method was used to detect the high-risk HPV in cervical lesions. RESULTS: The expression rate of TSLC1 gene methylation in normal cervical tissue, CIN I, CIN II, CIN III and SCC were 10.0%, 30.8%, 55.0%, 60.0%, 66.7%, respectively, showing a statistically significant difference (P = 0.004). The positive expression rate of TSLC1 protein in normal cervical tissue, CIN I, CIN II, CIN III and SCC were 100.0%, 80.8%, 65.0%, 33.3%, and 23.8%, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.004).

Actions of SIRT1 are pleiotropic, and effects on healthspan may include effects on DNA methylation. Polycomb group protein target genes (PCGTs) are suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms in stem cells, partly through the actions of the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), and have been shown previously to correspond with loci particularly susceptible to age-related changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that SIRT1 would affect DNA methylation particularly at PCGTs. To map the sites in the genome where SIRT1 affects DNA methylation, we altered SIRT1 expression in human intestinal (Caco-2) and vascular endothelial (HuVEC) cells by transient transfection with an expression construct or with siRNA. DNA was enriched for the methylated fraction then sequenced (HuVEC) or hybridised to a human promoter microarray (Caco-2). RESULTS: The profile of genes where SIRT1 manipulation affected DNA methylation was enriched for PCGTs in both cell lines, thus supporting our hypothesis. SIRT1 knockdown affected the mRNA for none of seven PRC components nor for DNMT1 or DNMT3b. We thus find no evidence that SIRT1 affects DNA methylation at PCGTs by affecting the expression of these gene transcripts. EZH2, a component of PRC2 that can affect DNA methylation through association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), did not co-immunoprecipitate with SIRT1, and SIRT1 knockdown did not affect the expression of EZH2 protein. Thus, it is unlikely that the effects of SIRT1 on DNA methylation at PCGTs are mediated through direct intermolecular association with EZH2 or through effects in its expression. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 affects DNA methylation across the genome, but particularly at PCGTs. Although the mechanism through which SIRT1 has these effects is yet to be uncovered, this action is likely to contribute to extended healthspan, for example under conditions of dietary restriction.",2.146,503

To investigate the association between methylation of COX-2 in blood leukocyte DNA and risk of gastric cancer (GC), a nested case-control study was conducted in Linqu County, Shandong Province, a high risk area of GC in China. METHODS: Association between blood leukocyte DNA methylation of COX-2 and risk of GC was investigated in 133 GCs and 285 superficial gastritis (SG)/ chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The temporal trend of COX-2 methylation level during GC development was further explored in 74 pre-GC and 95 post-GC samples (including 31 cases with both pre- and post-GC samples). In addition, the association of DNA methylation and risk of progression to GC was evaluated in 74 pre-GC samples and their relevant intestinal metaplasia (IM)/dysplasia (DYS) controls. Methylation level was determined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The medians of COX-2 methylation levels were 2.3% and 2.2% in GC cases and controls, respectively. No significant association was found between COX-2 methylation and risk of GC (OR, 1.15; 95% CI: 0.70-1.88). However, the temporal trend analysis showed that COX-2 methylation levels were elevated at 1-4 years ahead of clinical GC diagnosis compared with the year of GC diagnosis (3.0% vs. 2.2%, p=0.01). Further validation in 31 GCs with both pre- and post-GC samples indicated that COX-2 methylation levels were significantly decreased at the year of GC diagnosis compared with pre-GC samples (1.5% vs. 2.5%, p=0.02). No significant association between COX-2 methylation and risk of progression to GC was found in subjects with IM (OR, 0.50; 95% CI: 0.18-1.42) or DYS (OR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.23-2.18). Additionally, we found that elder people had increased risk of COX-2 hypermethylation (OR, 1.55; 95% CI: 1.02-2.36) and subjects who ever infected with H. pylori had decreased risk of COX-2 hypermethylation (OR, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.34-0.88).

Cell physiology,2015,"cAMP is a highly regulated secondary messenger involved in many biological processes. Chronic activation of the cAMP pathway by catecholamines results in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis; however, the mechanism by which elevated cAMP leads to cardiomyopathy is not fully understood. To address this issue, we increased intracellular cAMP levels in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, a cell line derived from adult mouse atrium, using either the stable cAMP analog N(6),2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP) or phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors caffeine and theophylline. Elevated cAMP levels increased cell size and altered expression levels of cardiac genes and micro-RNAs associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), including Myh6, Myh7, Myh7b, Tnni3, Anp, Bnp, Gata4, Mef2c, Mef2d, Nfatc1, miR208a, and miR208b. In addition, DBcAMP altered the expression of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases (Tets), enzymes that regulate genomic DNA methylation levels. Changes in expression of DNA methylation genes induced by elevated cAMP led to increased global DNA methylation in HL-1 cells. In contrast, inhibition of DNMT activity with 5-azacytidine treatment decreased global DNA methylation levels and blocked the increased expression of several HCM genes (Myh7, Gata4, Mef2c, Nfatc1, Myh7b, Tnni3, and Bnp) observed with DBcAMP treatment. These results demonstrate that cAMP induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and altered HCM gene expression in vitro and that DNA methylation patterns mediate the upregulation of HCM genes induced by cAMP. These data identify a previously unknown mechanism by which elevated levels of cAMP lead to increased expression of genes associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",3.78,204

However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ICAM-1 are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms on the regulation of ICAM-1 by NOP2/Sun domain family, member 2 (NSun2)-mediated mRNA methylation and the impact of NSun2-ICAM-1 regulatory process in vascular inflammation and allograft arteriosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: By using in vitro, in cells, and in vivo methylation assays, we showed that the tRNA methyltransferase NSun2 methylated the ICAM-1 mRNA. Methylation by NSun2 promoted the translation of ICAM-1, thereby increasing the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or homocysteine activated the methyltransferase activity of NSun2 by repressing the phosphorylation of NSun2 by Aurora-B. The levels of ICAM-1 induction and of leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium observed with homocysteine treatment in wild-type rats were markedly decreased in NSun2(-/-) rats. In a rat model of aortic allograft, the lack of donor NSun2 impaired the formation of allograft arteriosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: NSun2 upregulates the expression of ICAM-1 by methylating ICAM-1 mRNA.

L-methionine (MET) administration has been reported to cause a recrudescence of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and similar symptoms have been generated in MET-induced mice. In this study, a zebrafish animal model was used to evaluate the relationship between the gabrb2 mRNA expression and its promoter DNA methylation in developmental and MET-induced schizophrenia-like zebrafish. The results indicated developmental increases in global DNA methylation and decreases in gabrb2 promoter methylation in zebrafish. A significant increase in gabrb2 mRNA levels was observed after GABA was synthesized. Additionally, the MET-triggered schizophrenia-like symptoms in adult zebrafish, involving social withdrawal and cognitive dysfunction analyzed with social interaction and T-maze behavioral tests, were accompanied by significantly increased DNA methylation levels in the global genome and the gabrb2 promoter. Furthermore, the significant correlation between gabrb2 mRNA expression and gabrb2 promoter methylation observed in the developmental stages became non-significant in MET-triggered adult zebrafish. These findings demonstrate that gabrb2 mRNA expression is associated with DNA methylation varies by developmental stage and show that these epigenetic association mechanisms are disrupted in MET-triggered adult zebrafish with schizophrenia-like symptoms. In conclusion, these results provide plausible epigenetic evidence of the GABAA receptor beta2 subunit involvement in the schizophrenia-like behaviors and demonstrate the potential use of zebrafish models in neuropsychiatric research.",3.661,467

Although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, epigenetic dysregulation in fetal programming has been implicated. With regard to energy homoeostasis, PGC-1alpha (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha, encoded by the PPARGC1A gene) plays a regulatory role in several biochemical processes. We hypothesized that maternal gestational glucose levels would positively correlate with DNA methylation of the PPARGC1A promoter in placental tissue. We undertook a cross-sectional study of 58 mothers who underwent uncomplicated Caesarean delivery in a university hospital. Maternal gestational glucose concentration was determined after a 75-g OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Placenta tissue and cord blood were collected immediately after delivery. Genomic DNA was extracted and thereafter bisulfite conversion was performed. After PCR amplification, the DNA methylation of the PPARGC1A promoter was quantified using a pyrosequencing technique. The protein level of PGC-1alpha was evaluated by Western blotting. For all participants as a whole, including the GDM (gestational diabetes mellitus) and normoglycaemia groups, the maternal gestational glucose level was positively correlated with placental DNA methylation, and negatively correlated with cord blood DNA methylation of the PPARGC1A promoter in a CpG site-specific manner. In the GDM group alone, the placental CpG site-specific methylation of the PPARGC1A promoter strongly correlated with gestational 2-h post-OGTT glycaemia. Epigenetic alteration of the PPAGRC1A promoter may be one of the potential mechanisms underlying the metabolic programming in offspring exposed to intrauterine hyperglycaemia.",0,1073

 Toxicology",2015,"Cadmium is an established human lung carcinogen with weak mutagenicity. However, the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced carcinogenesis remain obscure. It has been suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in cadmium-induced carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of cadmium on histone methylation and histone demethylases, and the role of histone methylation in transformation of immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. Exposure to 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 muM of cadmium for 6, 24, and 48 h increased global trimethylated histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and dimethylated histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) in BEAS-2B cells compared with untreated cells, and most of these changes remained after the removal of cadmium (P < .05 or P < .01 for most modifications). Meanwhile, cadmium inhibited the activities of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4) and histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) demethylases which were detected by histone demethylation assay. However, there was no significant change in the protein levels of the H3K4 demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 5A (KDM5A) and the H3K9 demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 3A (KDM3A). Interestingly, during transformation of BEAS-2B cells by 20 weeks of exposure to 2.0 muM cadmium as assessed by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, global H3K4me3, and H3K9me2 were significantly increased at 4 weeks (P < .05 or P < .01), whereas no significant change was observed at 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks compared with control. Our study suggests that cadmium increases global H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 by inhibiting the activities of histone demethylases, and aberrant histone methylation that occurs early (48 h) and at 4 weeks is associated with cadmium-induced transformation of BEAS-2B cells at the early stage.",0.825,245

However, its sensitivity is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate DNA methylation biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of benign (ascites in patients without malignancy), malignant (ascites in cancer patients directly caused by malignancy), and paramalignant (ascites in cancer patients caused by comorbidities but not by malignancy) ascites. METHODS: A cohort of 283 patients (134 cancer patients, 149 patients with benign diseases) presenting with ascites was prospectively enrolled. Ascites was evaluated by means of cytopathological investigation and DNA methylation of SHOX2 and SEPT9 in the cell-free and cellular fraction. DNA methylation in bisulfite-converted DNA was determined using quantitative methylation specific real-time PCR. Cytopathological and DNA methylation results were evaluated with regard to diagnosis and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Patients with positive DNA methylation had a poor overall survival compared to methylation-negative patients (hazard ratio: HR = 1.97, p = 0.001). In multivariate survival analysis, DNA methylation was an independent prognostic parameter (p = 0.003) together with age (HR = 1.03, p < 0.001) and the presence of malignant disease (HR = 1.87, p < 0.001). The combination of methylation with cytopathological analyses led to a 42 % increase in the detection rate of malignant ascites, resulting in 37 % positively diagnosed cancer patients and a specificity of 97 %. Among cancer patients, patients with DNA methylation-positive ascites showed an adverse clinical course (HR = 1.63, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation testing adds diagnostic and prognostic information and might constitute an effective ancillary method for the differential diagnosis of malignant, paramalignant, and benign ascites.",4.543,91

Arsenic is another neurotoxicant that can affect intellectual function in children. This study was designed to explore the difference of arsenic methylation capacity indices between with and without developmental delay in preschool children. We also aimed to identify whether blood levels of lead or mercury modify the effect of arsenic methylation capacity indices. A cross sectional study was conducted from August 2010 to March 2012. All participants recruited from the Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Teaching Hospital. In all, 63 children with developmental delay and 35 children without developmental delay were recruited. Urinary arsenic species, including arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) were measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry. Lead and mercury levels of red blood cells were measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. All participants underwent developmental assessments to confirm developmental delays, including evaluations of gross motor, fine motor, speech-language, cognition, social, and emotional domains. Urinary total arsenic and MMA(V) percentage were significantly positively associated and DMA(V) percentage was negatively associated with the risk of developmental delay in a dose-dependent manner after adjustment for blood lead or mercury levels and other risk factors. A multivariate regression analysis indicated that blood lead level and arsenic methylation capacity each independently contributed to the risk of developmental delay.

Recent advances in technology have permitted the profiling of high-throughput methylomes in large numbers of biological samples. Various computational tools have been developed to identify and analyze DNA methylation dynamics in a variety of critical biological processes. As DNA methylation is becoming increasingly viewed as a dynamic process, the mechanisms governing DNA methylation dynamics and its roles in the transcriptional regulatory network are of great interest. It has been reported that DNA methylation dynamics plays essential roles in multiple biological processes, including development and cancer. As a functional event, the dynamics of DNA methylation have become increasingly relevant to many researchers.

Little is known about how cells manage the balance between DNA methylation and active demethylation activities. Here, we report the identification of a unique RdDM target sequence, where DNA methylation is required for maintaining proper active DNA demethylation of the Arabidopsis genome. In a genetic screen for cellular antisilencing factors, we isolated several REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ros1) mutant alleles, as well as many RdDM mutants, which showed drastically reduced ROS1 gene expression and, consequently, transcriptional silencing of two reporter genes. A helitron transposon element (TE) in the ROS1 gene promoter negatively controls ROS1 expression, whereas DNA methylation of an RdDM target sequence between ROS1 5' UTR and the promoter TE region antagonizes this helitron TE in regulating ROS1 expression. This RdDM target sequence is also targeted by ROS1, and defective DNA demethylation in loss-of-function ros1 mutant alleles causes DNA hypermethylation of this sequence and concomitantly causes increased ROS1 expression. Our results suggest that this sequence in the ROS1 promoter region serves as a DNA methylation monitoring sequence (MEMS) that senses DNA methylation and active DNA demethylation activities. Therefore, the ROS1 promoter functions like a thermostat (i.e., methylstat) to sense DNA methylation levels and regulates DNA methylation by controlling ROS1 expression.",9.674,884

Identifying tumors with greater malignant potential can have significant clinical value. This validated genome-wide methylation study comparing Grade I with Grade II and III meningiomas aims to discover genes that are aberrantly methylated in atypical meningiomas. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed meningioma were identified as part of the Ohio Brain Tumor Study. The Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) was used to interrogate 27,578 CpG sites in 14,000 genes per sample for a discovery set of 33 samples (3 atypical). To verify the results, the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) was used to interrogate 450,000 cytosines at CpG loci throughout the genome for a verification set containing 7 replicates (3 atypical), as well as 12 independent samples (6 atypical). A nonparametric Wilcoxon exact test was used to test for difference in methylation between benign and atypical meningiomas in both sets. Heat maps were generated for each set. Methylation results were validated for the 2 probes with the largest difference in methylation intensity by performing Western blot analysis on a set of 20 (10 atypical) samples, including 11 replicates. RESULTS: The discovery array identified 95 probes with differential methylation between benign and atypical meningiomas, creating 2 distinguishable groups corresponding to tumor grade when visually examined on a heat map. The validation array evaluated 87 different probes and showed that 9 probes were differentially methylated. On heat map examination the results of this array also suggested the existence of 2 major groups that corresponded to histological grade. IGF2BP1 and PDCD1, 2 proteins that can increase the malignant potential of tumors, were the 2 probes with the largest difference in intensity, and for both of these the atypical meningiomas had a decreased median production of protein, though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.970 for IGF2BP1 and p = 1 for PDCD1). CONCLUSIONS: A genome-wide methylation analysis of benign and atypical meningiomas identified 9 genes that were reliably differentially methylated, with the strongest difference in IGF2BP1 and PDCD1. The mechanism why increased methylation of these sites is associated with an aggressive phenotype is not evident. Future research may investigate this mechanism, as well as the utility of IGF2BP1 as a marker for pathogenicity in otherwise benign-appearing meningiomas.",3.737,1870

Here, six anthocyanins were identified in peach (Prunus persica), and their structural diversity is attributed to glycosylation and methylation. Interestingly, peach is quite similar to the wild species Prunus ferganensis but differs from both Prunus davidiana and Prunus kansueasis in terms of anthocyanin composition in flowers. This indicates that peach is probably domesticated from P. ferganensis. Subsequently, genes responsible for both methylation and glycosylation of anthocyanins were identified, and their spatiotemporal expression results in different patterns of anthocyanin accumulation in flowers, leaves, and fruits. Two tandem-duplicated genes encoding flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (F3GT) in peach, PpUGT78A1 and PpUGT78A2, showed different activity toward anthocyanin, providing an example of divergent evolution of F3GT genes in plants. Two genes encoding anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT), PpAOMT1 and PpAOMT2, are expressed in leaves and flowers, but only PpAOMT2 is responsible for the O-methylation of anthocyanins at the 3' position in peach. In addition, our study reveals a novel branch of UGT78 genes in plants that lack the highly conserved intron 2 of the UGT gene family, with a great variation of the amino acid residue at position 22 of the plant secondary product glycosyltransferase box. Our results not only provide insights into the mechanisms underlying anthocyanin glycosylation and methylation in peach but will also aid in future attempts to manipulate flavonoid biosynthesis in peach as well as in other plants.",6.841,1140

Intermediate methylation regions average 57% methylation, are predominantly allele-independent and are conserved across individuals and between mouse and human, suggesting a conserved function. These regions have an intermediate level of active chromatin marks and their associated genes have intermediate transcriptional activity.

Alterations in DNA methylation patterns have been associated with different types of tumor. In order to detect markers of susceptibility for the development of cutaneous melanoma and breast cancer in the Uruguayan population, we integrated genetic and epigenetic information of patients and controls. METHODS: We performed two case-control studies that included 49 individuals with sporadic cutaneous melanoma and 73 unaffected controls, and 179 women with sporadic breast cancer and 209 women controls. We determined the level of global leukocyte DNA methylation using relative quantification of 5mdC by HPLC, and we compared methylation levels between cases and controls with nonparametric statistical tests. Since the Uruguayan population is admixed and both melanoma and breast cancer have very high incidences in Uruguay compared to other populations, we examined whether individual ancestry influences global leucocyte DNA methylation status. We carried out a correlation analysis between the percentage of African, European and Native American individual ancestries, determined using 59 ancestry informative markers, and global DNA methylation in all participants. RESULTS: We detected global DNA hypomethylation in leukocytes of melanoma and breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Additionally, we found a negative correlation between African ancestry and global DNA methylation in cancer patients (p <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the potential use of global DNA methylation as a biomarker for cancer risk. In addition, our findings suggest that the ancestral genome structure generated by the admixture process influences DNA methylation patterns, and underscore the importance of considering genetic ancestry as a modifying factor in epigenetic association studies in admixed populations such as Latino ones.",3.362,613

To address the need for a quantitative and highly multiplexed bisulfite sequencing method with long read lengths for targeted CpG methylation analysis, we developed single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing (SMRT-BS). RESULTS: Optimized bisulfite conversion and PCR conditions enabled the amplification of DNA fragments up to ~1.5 kb, and subjecting overlapping 625-1491 bp amplicons to SMRT-BS indicated high reproducibility across all amplicon lengths (r=0.972) and low standard deviations (</=0.10) between individual CpG sites sequenced in triplicate. Higher variability in CpG methylation quantitation was correlated with reduced sequencing depth, particularly for intermediately methylated regions. SMRT-BS was validated by orthogonal bisulfite-based microarray (r=0.906; 42 CpG sites) and second generation sequencing (r=0.933; 174 CpG sites); however, longer SMRT-BS amplicons (>1.0 kb) had reduced, but very acceptable, correlation with both orthogonal methods (r=0.836-0.897 and r=0.892-0.927, respectively) compared to amplicons less than ~1.0 kb (r=0.940-0.951 and r=0.948-0.963, respectively). Multiplexing utility was assessed by simultaneously subjecting four distinct CpG island amplicons (702-866 bp; 325 CpGs) and 30 hematological malignancy cell lines to SMRT-BS (average depth of 110X), which identified a spectrum of highly quantitative methylation levels across all interrogated CpG sites and cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: SMRT-BS is a novel, accurate and cost-effective targeted CpG methylation method that is amenable to a high degree of multiplexing with minimal clonal PCR artifacts. Increased sequencing depth is necessary when interrogating longer amplicons (>1.0 kb) and the previously reported bisulfite sequencing PCR bias towards unmethylated DNA should be considered when measuring intermediately methylated regions. Coupled with an optimized bisulfite PCR protocol, SMRT-BS is capable of interrogating ~1.5 kb amplicons, which theoretically can cover ~91% of CpG islands in the human genome.",3.986,999

However, the exact mechanism by which HGF regulates HCC initiation and development via epigenetic reprogramming has remained elusive. The present study focused on the epigenetic modification and target tumor-suppressive genes of HGF treatment in HCC. Expression profiling and DNA methylation array were performed to investigate the function of HGF and examine global genomic DNA methylation changes, respectively. Integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation revealed potential tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in HCC.

 States of America",2016,"RNA silencing at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels regulates endogenous gene expression, controls invading transposable elements (TEs), and protects the cell against viruses. Key components of the mechanism are small RNAs (sRNAs) of 21-24 nt that guide the silencing machinery to their nucleic acid targets in a nucleotide sequence-specific manner. Transcriptional gene silencing is associated with 24-nt sRNAs and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) at cytosine residues in three DNA sequence contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH). We previously demonstrated that 24-nt sRNAs are mobile from shoot to root in Arabidopsis thaliana and confirmed that they mediate DNA methylation at three sites in recipient cells. In this study, we extend this finding by demonstrating that RdDM of thousands of loci in root tissues is dependent upon mobile sRNAs from the shoot and that mobile sRNA-dependent DNA methylation occurs predominantly in non-CG contexts. Mobile sRNA-dependent non-CG methylation is largely dependent on the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASES 1/2 (DRM1/DRM2) RdDM pathway but is independent of the CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT)2/3 DNA methyltransferases. Specific superfamilies of TEs, including those typically found in gene-rich euchromatic regions, lose DNA methylation in a mutant lacking 22- to 24-nt sRNAs (dicer-like 2, 3, 4 triple mutant). Transcriptome analyses identified a small number of genes whose expression in roots is associated with mobile sRNAs and connected to DNA methylation directly or indirectly. Finally, we demonstrate that sRNAs from shoots of one accession move across a graft union and target DNA methylation de novo at normally unmethylated sites in the genomes of root cells from a different accession.",9.674,72

We have thus hypothesized that LEP and ADIPOQ DNA methylation changes might be involved in obesity development and its related complications. The objective of this study was to assess whether LEP and ADIPOQ DNA methylation levels measured in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissues (VAT) are associated with anthropometric measures and metabolic profile in severely obese men and women. These analyses were repeated with DNA methylation profiles from blood cells obtained from the same individuals to determine whether they showed similarities. METHODS: Paired SAT, VAT and blood samples were obtained from 73 severely obese patients undergoing a bioliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. LEP and ADIPOQ DNA methylation and mRNA levels were quantified using bisulfite-pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients were computed to determine the associations between LEP and ADIPOQ DNA methylation levels, anthropometric measures and metabolic profile. RESULTS: DNA methylation levels at the ADIPOQ gene locus in SAT was positively associated with BMI and waist girth whereas LEP DNA methylation levels in blood cells were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI). Fasting LDL-C levels were found to be positively correlated with DNA methylation levels at LEP-CpG11 and -CpG17 in blood and SAT and with ADIPOQ DNA methylation levels in SAT (CpGE1 and CpGE3) and VAT (CpGE1). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that LEP and ADIPOQ epigenetic profiles are associated with obesity. We also report associations between LDL-C levels and both LEP and ADIPOQ DNA methylation levels suggesting that LDL-C might regulate their epigenetic profiles in adipose tissues.

Here, we review the effect of stress-induced DNA methylation changes on physiological mechanisms that govern behavior and cognition, dysregulation of which can be harmful to mental health. A literature review was performed in the areas of DNA methylation, stress, and their impact on the brain and psychiatric illness. Key findings center on genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neurotransmission and neuroplasticity. Using animal models of different stress paradigms and clinical studies, we detail how DNA methylation changes to these genes can alter physiological mechanisms that influence behavior. Appropriate levels of gene expression in the brain play an important role in mental health. This dynamic control can be disrupted by stress-induced changes to DNA methylation patterns.

The etiological viewpoint is also essential for the study of gastric cancers, and two distinct pathogens, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are known to participate in gastric carcinogenesis. Chronic inflammation of the gastric epithelium due to H. pylori infection induces aberrant polyclonal methylation that may lead to an increased risk of gastric cancer. In addition, EBV infection is known to cause extensive methylation, and EBV-positive gastric cancers display a high methylation epigenotype, in which aberrant methylation extends to not only Polycomb repressive complex (PRC)-target genes in embryonic stem cells but also non-PRC-target genes.

The effects of cytokines on methylation and expression of the insulin gene were studied in humans and mice. RESULTS: During disease progression in NOD mice, there was an inverse relationship between the proportion of infiltrating lymphocytes and the beta cell mass. In beta cells, methylation marks in the Ins1 and Ins2 genes changed over time. Insulin gene expression appears to be most closely regulated by the methylation of Ins1 exon 2 and Ins2 exon 1. Cytokine transcription increased with age in NOD mice, and these cytokines could induce methylation marks in the insulin DNA by inducing methyltransferases. Similar changes were induced by cytokines in human beta cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Epigenetic modification of DNA by methylation in response to immunological stressors may be a mechanism that affects insulin gene expression during the progression of type 1 diabetes.",6.671,1137
26789724,Effects of Gestational Magnetic Resonance Imaging on Methylation Status of Leptin Promoter in the Placenta and Cord Blood.,"['Wang Y', 'Yan FS', 'Lian JM', 'Dou SW']",PloS one,2016,"Over the past two decades, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for diagnosis in gestational women. Though it has several advantages, animal and human studies on the safety of MRI for the fetus remain inconclusive. Epigenetic modifications, which are crucial for cellular functioning, are prone to being affected by environmental changes. Therefore, we hypothesized that MRI during gestation may cause epigenetic modification alterations. Here, we investigated DNA methylation patterns of leptin promoter in the placenta and cord blood of women exposed to MRI during gestation. Results showed that average methylation levels of leptin in the placenta and cord blood were not affected by MRI. We also found that the methylation levels in the placenta and cord blood were not affected by different magnetic fields (1.5T and 3.0T MRI). However, if pregnant women were exposed to MRI at 15 to 20 weeks of gestation, the methylation level of leptin in cord blood was visibly lower than that of pregnant women exposed to MRI after 20-weeks of gestation (P = 0.037). mRNA expression level of leptin in cord blood was also altered, though mRNA expression of leptin in the placenta was not significantly affected. Therefore, we concluded that gestational MRI may not have major effects on the methylation level of leptin in cord blood and the placenta except for MRI applied before 20 weeks of gestation.",3.234,479

The role of inter-individual genetic variation in influencing DNA methylation, leading to the possibility of confounding or bias of such associations, has not been assessed. We investigated whether the DNA methylation levels at the top ten CpG sites previously associated with exposure to maternal smoking during gestation were associated with individual genetic variation at the genome-wide level. Genome-wide association tests between DNA methylation at the top ten candidate CpG and genome-wide SNPs were performed in 736 case and control participants of the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Three of the strongest maternal-smoking sensitive CpG sites in newborns were significantly associated with SNPs located proximal to each gene: cg18146737 in the GFI1 gene with rs141819830 (P = 8.2x10-44), cg05575921 in the AHRR gene with rs148405299 (P = 5.3x10-10), and cg12803068 in the MYO1G gene with rs61087368 (P = 1.3x10-18). For the GFI1 CpG cg18146737, the underlying genetic variation at rs141819830 confounded the association between maternal smoking and DNA methylation in our data [OR changed from 0.89 (0.75-1.06, P = 0.184) to 0.78 (0.63-0.97, P = 0.024) after including the genotype]. Our results suggest that further studies using DNA methylation at cg18146737, cg05575921, or cg12803068 that aim to assess exposure to maternal smoking during gestation should include genotype at the corresponding SNP. New methods are required for adequate and routine inclusion of genotypic influence on DNA methylation in epigenome-wide association studies to control for potential confounding.",4.78,563
27303433,"Emerging Molecular and Biological Functions of MBD2, a Reader of DNA Methylation.","['Wood KH', 'Zhou Z']",Frontiers in genetics,2016,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is essential for many biological processes and is linked to diseases such as cancer. Methylation is usually associated with transcriptional silencing, but new research has challenged this model. Both transcriptional activation and repression have recently been found to be associated with DNA methylation in a context-specific manner. How DNA methylation patterns are interpreted into different functional output remains poorly understood. One mechanism involves the protein 'readers' of methylation, which includes the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) family of proteins. This review examines the molecular and biological functions of MBD2, which binds to CpG methylation and is an integral part of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex. MBD2 has been linked to immune system function and tumorigenesis, yet little is known about its functions in vivo. Recent studies have found the MBD2 protein is ubiquitously expressed, with relatively high levels in the lung, liver, and colon. Mbd2 null mice surprisingly show relatively mild phenotypes compared to mice with loss of function of other MBD proteins. This evidence has previously been interpreted as functional redundancy between the MBD proteins. Here, we examine and contextualize research that suggests MBD2 has unique properties and functions among the MBD proteins. These functions translate to recently described roles in the development and differentiation of multiple cell lineages, including pluripotent stem cells and various cell types of the immune system, as well as in tumorigenesis. We also consider possible models for the dynamic interactions between MBD2 and NuRD in different tissues in vivo. The functions of MBD2 may have direct therapeutic implications for several areas of human disease, including autoimmune conditions and cancer, in addition to providing insights into the actions of NuRD and chromatin regulation.",0,1753

Recently, epigenetic processes including SLC6A4 promoter methylation were shown to be affected by stress, trauma, or maltreatment and are regarded to be involved in the etiology of affective disorders. However, neurobiological correlates of SLC6A4 promoter methylation have never been studied or compared to genotype effects by means of human neuroimaging hitherto METHODS: Healthy subjects were recruited in two independent samples (N = 94, N = 95) to obtain structural gray matter images processed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM8), focusing on hippocampal, amygdala, and anterior cingulate gyrus gray matter structure. SLC6A4 promoter methylation within an AluJb element and 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotypes were analyzed in view of a possible impact on local gray matter volume RESULTS: Strong associations of AluJb methylation and hippocampal gray matter volumes emerged within each sample separately, which in the combined sample withstood most conservative alpha-corrections for the entire brain. The amygdala, insula, and caudate nucleus showed similar associations. The 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 showed no main effect on gray matter, and the effect of methylation rates on hippocampal structure was comparable among the genotype groups CONCLUSIONS: Methylation within the AluJb appears to have strong effects on hippocampal gray matter volumes, indicating that epigenetic processes can alter brain structures crucially involved in stress-related disorders. Different ways of regulating SLC6A4 expression might involve exonization or transcription factor binding as potentially underlying mechanisms, which, however, is speculative and warrants further investigation.",5.969,1082

It is helpful for distinguishing the specificity of diagnosis and therapeutic targets for cancers based on characteristics of DNA methylation patterns across cancers. High throughput DNA methylation analysis provides the possibility to comprehensively filter the epigenetics diversity across various cancers. We integrated whole-genome methylation data detected in 798 samples from seven cancers. The hierarchical clustering revealed the existence of cancer-specific methylation pattern. Then we identified 331 differentially methylated genes across these cancers, most of which (266) were specifically differential methylation in unique cancer. A DNA methylation correlation network (DMCN) was built based on the methylation correlation between these genes. It was shown the hubs in the DMCN were inclined to cancer-specific genes in seven cancers. Further survival analysis using the part of genes in the DMCN revealed high-risk group and low-risk group were distinguished by seven biomarkers (PCDHB15, WBSCR17, IGF1, GYPC, CYGB, ACTG2, and PRRT1) in breast cancer and eight biomarkers (ZBTB32, OR51B4, CCL8, TMEFF2, SALL3, GPSM1, MAGEA8, and SALL1) in colon cancer, respectively. At last, a protein-protein interaction network was introduced to verify the biological function of differentially methylated genes. It was shown that MAP3K14, PTN, ACVR1 and HCK sharing different DNA methylation and gene expression across cancers were relatively high degree distribution in PPI network. The study suggested that not only the identified cancer-specific genes provided reference for individual treatment but also the relationship across cancers could be explained by differential DNA methylation.",3.234,1167

Gastrointestinal and liver
 physiology",2015,"Alcohol exposure worsens the course and outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Activation of protective antiviral genes is induced by IFN-alpha signaling, which is altered in liver cells by either HCV or ethanol exposure. However, the mechanisms of the combined effects of HCV and ethanol metabolism in IFN-alpha signaling modulation are not well elucidated. Here, we explored a possibility that ethanol metabolism potentiates HCV-mediated dysregulation of IFN-alpha signaling in liver cells via impairment of methylation reactions. HCV-infected Huh7.5 CYP2E1(+) cells and human hepatocytes were exposed to acetaldehyde (Ach)-generating system (AGS) and stimulated with IFN-alpha to activate IFN-sensitive genes (ISG) via the Jak-STAT-1 pathway. We observed significant suppression of signaling events by Ach. Ach exposure decreased STAT-1 methylation via activation of protein phosphatase 2A and increased the protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 (PIAS-1)-STAT-1 complex formation in both HCV(+) and HCV(-) cells, preventing ISG activation. Treatment with a promethylating agent, betaine, attenuated all examined Ach-induced defects. Ethanol metabolism-induced changes in ISGs are methylation related and confirmed by in vivo studies on HCV(+) transgenic mice. HCV- and Ach-induced impairment of IFN signaling temporarily increased HCV RNA levels followed by apoptosis of heavily infected cells. We concluded that Ach potentiates the suppressive effects of HCV on activation of ISGs attributable to methylation-dependent dysregulation of IFN-alpha signaling. A temporary increase in HCV RNA sensitizes the liver cells to Ach-induced apoptosis. Betaine reverses the inhibitory effects of Ach on IFN signaling and thus can be used for treatment of HCV(+) alcohol-abusing patients.",3.798,1447

The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR) and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were calculated by Meta-DiSc1.4 (http://www.hrc.es/investigacion/metadisc.html) software. RESULTS: Nine studies involving 487 gastric cancer patients and 271 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. The median methylation rate for gastric cancer group was 43.3% with its range of 28.3-64.4%. And the median methylation rate for healthy control group was 0.0% with its range of 0.0-13.3%.

The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is an anadromous species that experiences metamorphosis all the way up to the adult stage. Although representing a gradual process, metamorphosis in this species involves dramatic conversions with regard to physiological together with structural body changes preparing individuals for a marine and parasitic life; in consequence, multiple gene expression modifications are expected. The implications of thyroid hormones and HOX gene expression changes have previously been reported in this species and also in other vertebrate species. Nonetheless, information lacks on how these genes are regulated in lampreys. We here report about the existence of methylation pattern differences between the adult and the larvae sea lamprey life cycle stages making use of the Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) technique. Differentially methylated fragment sequencing allowed to establish homologous identities with HOX genes involved in morphogenesis, along with genes related to the water balance and to the osmotic homoeostasis, all associated to a marine environment adaptation. These results provide evidences revealing that DNA methylation plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of the P. marinus post-natal development representing a starting point for future studies.

In this study, we investigate short-term effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on DNA methylation levels at CpG sites across the genome in circulating blood in asthmatics. METHODS: A double-blind crossover study of filtered air and diesel exhaust exposures was performed on sixteen non-smoking asthmatic subjects. Blood samples were collected pre-exposure, and then 6 and 30 hours post-exposure. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA methylation was interrogated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array. Exposure-related changes in DNA methylation were identified. In addition, CpG sites overlapping with Alu or LINE1 repetitive elements and candidate microRNA loci were also analyzed. RESULTS: DNA methylation at 2827 CpG sites were affected by exposure to diesel exhaust but not filtered air; these sites enriched for genes involved in protein kinase and NFkB pathways. CpG sites with significant changes in response to diesel exhaust exposure primarily became less methylated, with a site residing within GSTP1 being among the significant hits. Diesel exhaust-associated change was also found for CpG sites overlapping with Alu and LINE1 elements as well as for a site within miR-21. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to diesel exhaust resulted in DNA methylation changes at CpG sites residing in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress response, repetitive elements, and microRNA.

Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome.

High concentrations of Hcy in a condition called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are an independent risk factor for several disorders including cardiovascular diseases and osteoporotic fractures. Since Hcy is produced as a byproduct of the methyltransferase reaction, alteration in DNA methylation is studied as one of the underlying mechanisms of HHcy-associated disorders. In animal models, elevated Hcy concentrations are induced either by diet (high methionine, low B-vitamins, or both), gene knockouts (Mthfr, Cbs, Mtrr or Mtr) or combination of both to investigate their effects on DNA methylation or its markers. In humans, most of the literature involves case-control studies concerning patients. The focus of this review is to study existing literature on HHcy and its role in relation to DNA methylation.

It may potentially be used as a prognostic marker in studies for patients with breast cancer and plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Numerous studies have suggested that the methylation of the BRCA1 promoter is associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. However, the prognosis of BRCA1 promoter methylation in breast cancer patients of different ethnicities remains ambiguous. The present meta-analysis was performed to adjust and augment a previously published study, which estimated the correlations between promoter methylation of BRCA1 and the clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients. These results indicated that BRCA1 methylation was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis of breast cancer, particularly for Asian patients, but the correlation was over-estimated in the previous study. The combined hazard ratios (HRs) in the present study were 1.76 (1.15-2.68) and 1.97 (1.12-3.44) for univariate and multivariate analysis of overall survival, which were different from 2.02 (1.35-3.03) and 1.38 (1.04-1.84) in the previous study.

Although deficiencies in FA factors are commonly associated with germ cell defects, it remains unknown whether the FA pathway is involved in unique epigenetic events in germ cells. In this study, we generated Fancb mutant mice, the first mouse model of X-linked FA, and identified a novel function of the FA pathway in epigenetic regulation during mammalian gametogenesis. Fancb mutant mice were infertile and exhibited primordial germ cell (PGC) defects during embryogenesis. Further, Fancb mutation resulted in the reduction of undifferentiated spermatogonia in spermatogenesis, suggesting that FANCB regulates the maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Additionally, based on functional studies, we dissected the pathway in which FANCB functions during meiosis. The localization of FANCB on sex chromosomes is dependent on MDC1, a binding partner of H2AX phosphorylated at serine 139 (gammaH2AX), which initiates chromosome-wide silencing. Also, FANCB is required for FANCD2 localization during meiosis, suggesting that the role of FANCB in the activation of the FA pathway is common to both meiosis and somatic DNA damage responses. H3K9me2, a silent epigenetic mark, was decreased on sex chromosomes, whereas H3K9me3 was increased on sex chromosomes in Fancb mutant spermatocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that FANCB functions at critical stages of germ cell development and reveal a novel function of the FA pathway in the regulation of H3K9 methylation in the germline.",6.393,1669

Functional significance of genic- and intergenic-CpG methylation status was tested using protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions and gene-ontology enrichment to infer networks. Combined, the results suggest that methylation has the potential to affect HDI mass transport, permeation, and HDI metabolism.

As randomized trials are not feasible in this context, we included observational (cohort and case-control) studies comparing outcomes in children conceived through ART with those conceived spontaneously, irrespective of the language of publication. The outcome measures were DNA methylation and the incidence of imprinting disorders. RESULTS: A total of 351 publications were identified by the initial search. Of these, 26 were excluded as duplicates and 241 were excluded after reviewing the abstracts, then of those remaining 66 were excluded after review of the full text. A total of 18 papers were included in the review. Apart from one case-control study, all were cohort studies. There was a degree of clinical heterogeneity in terms of the study population, type of infertility treatment, and samples obtained from exposed and unexposed children. DNA methylation levels were either presented as categorical data (hypo-, hyper- or normally methylated DNA) or continuous data (i.e. percentage of methylated DNA). The combined odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of any imprinting disorder in children conceived through ART was 3.67 (1.39, 9.74) in comparison with spontaneously conceived children. Meta-analysis of data from relevant studies revealed that the weighted mean difference (95% confidence intervals) in methylation percent between IVF/ICSI versus spontaneously conceived children were as follows: H19: -0.46(-1.41, 0.49), PEG1-MEST: 0.47 (-2.07, 3.01), GRB10: -0.05 (-0.43, 0.33), IGF2: -0.15 (-1.09, 0.79), SNRPN: -0.55 (-1.55, 0.46), KvDMR/KCNQ10T1: -0.16 (-0.34, 0.02) and PEG3: -0.24 (-1.72, 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in imprinting disorders in children conceived though IVF and ICSI but insufficient evidence for an association between ART and methylation in other imprinted genes. Heterogeneity in the types of fertility treatment, the imprinted regions studied, the tissues used and the methods of measurement, reduce our ability to assess the full effect of ART on DNA methylation and imprinting. More controlled studies, using standardized methodologies, in larger, better clinically defined populations are needed.",10.165,1112

 experimental and clinical research",2014,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) has been reported in several human cancers. However, the methylation status of PCDH17 in prostate cancer and its clinical significance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of PCDH17 and its clinical significance in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. MATERIAL/METHODS: The methylation status of PCDH17 in 152 prostate cancer tissues and 51 non-tumoral prostate tissues was examined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Then the association between PCDH17 methylation and clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis were used to analyze the correlation between PCDH17 methylation and prognosis of patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that PCDH17 methylation occurred frequently in prostate cancer. PCDH17 methylation was significantly associated with higher pathological Gleason score (P=0.0315), advanced pathological stage (P=0.0260), higher level of preoperative PSA (P=0.0354), positive angiolymphatic invasion (P=0.0461), positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.0362), and biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P=0.0018). In addition, PCDH17 methylation was an independent predictor of poor biochemical recurrence-free (BCR-free) survival and overall survival for patients with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: PCDH17 methylation is a frequent tumor-specific event in prostate cancer, and is significantly correlated with shorter BCR-free survival and overall survival of patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. PCDH17 methylation in tumor samples after radical prostatectomy may be used as an independent prognostic biomarker.",1.433,1994

A total of 48 patients with IAs, 22 patients with BAVMs, and 26 control individuals were enrolled in the study. DNA methylation was tested using bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. We detected significantly higher DNA methylation levels in BAVM patients than in IA patients based on the multiple testing correction (CpG4-5 methylation: 5.86+/-1.04% vs. 4.37+/-2.64%, P=0.006). In women, CpG4-5 methylation levels were much lower in IA patients (3.64+/-1.97%) than in BAVM patients (6.11+/-1.20%, P<0.0001). However, in men, CpG1-3 methylation levels were much higher in the controls (6.92+/-0.78%) than in BAVM patients (5.99+/-0.70%, P=0.008). Additionally, there was a gender-based difference in CpG1 methylation within the controls (men vs. women: 5.75+/-0.50% vs. 4.99+/-0.53%, P=0.003) and BAVM patients (men vs. women: 4.70+/-0.74% vs. 5.50+/-0.87%, P=0.026). A subgroup analysis revealed significantly higher CpG3 methylation in patients who smoked than in those who did not (P=0.041). Our results suggested that gender modulated the interaction between NOS1AP promoter DNA methylation in IA and BAVM patients. Our results also confirmed that regular tobacco smoking was associated with increased NOS1AP methylation in humans. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to replicate and extend these findings.",2.03,721

 Pathophysiology",2015,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of DNA methyhransferase l (DNMT1) gene silencing on methylation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1) in multiple myeloma RPMI 8226 cells. METHODS: Recombinant plasmid pshRNA-DNMTl was transfected into multiple myeloma RPMI 8226 cells by lipofectamine 2000. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of DNMTl in RPMI 8226 cells respectively before and after transfection. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the methylation level change of SOCS-1 gene in RPMI8226 cells transfected. RESULTS: DNMTl targeted short hairpin RNA(shRNA) was successfully inserted into the plasmid vector pshRNA. RT-PCR results showed that the relative mRNA expression level of DNMTI gene in RPMI 8226 cells transfected with pshRNA was 0.176+/-0.004 which was significantly lower than that in cells transfected by empty vector (0.956+/-0.033, P<0.01). Western blot analysis showed that the relative expression level of DNMT1 protein of RPMI 8226 cells transfected by pshRNA was 0.065+/-0.014, which was significantly lower than that in transfected cells by empty vector(0.415+/-0.027) (P<0.05). These results indicated that the recombinant plasmid pshRNA could effectively knock down the expression of DNMT1 gene in RPMI 8226 cells. Methylation analysis showed that the methylation level of SOCS-1 gene was obviously reduced after transfection. CONCLUSION: DNMT1 gene in RPMI 8226 cell can be silenced by shRNA. DNMT1 gene silencing can significantly induce SOCS-1 gene hypomethylation, which indicates that DNMT1 may play an important role in the process of SOCS-1 hypermethylation.",0,1419

However, current knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics in human tissue specification and organ development largely stems from the extrapolation of studies in vitro and animal models. Here, we report on the DNA methylation landscape using the 450k array of four human tissues (amnion, muscle, adrenal and pancreas) during the first and second trimester of gestation (9,18 and 22 weeks). We show that a tissue-specific signature, constituted by tissue-specific hypomethylated CpG sites, was already present at 9 weeks of gestation (W9). Furthermore, we report large-scale remodelling of DNA methylation from W9 to W22. Gain of DNA methylation preferentially occurred near genes involved in general developmental processes, whereas loss of DNA methylation mapped to genes with tissue-specific functions. Dynamic DNA methylation was associated with enhancers, but not promoters. Comparison of our data with external fetal adrenal, brain and liver revealed striking similarities in the trajectory of DNA methylation during fetal development. The analysis of gene expression data indicated that dynamic DNA methylation was associated with the progressive repression of developmental programs and the activation of genes involved in tissue-specific processes. The DNA methylation landscape of human fetal development provides insight into regulatory elements that guide tissue specification and lead to organ functionality.",7.528,289

We aimed to test the association between breast cancer risk and epigenome-wide methylation in DNA from peripheral blood. Nested case-control study within the prospective Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. DNA was extracted from before-diagnosis blood samples (420 incident cases and matched controls). Methylation was measured with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip array. Odds ratio (OR) for epigenome-wide methylation, quantified as the mean beta values across the CpGs, in relation to breast cancer risk were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Overall, the OR for breast cancer was 0.42 (95% CI 0.20-0.90) for the top versus bottom quartile of epigenome-wide DNA methylation and the OR for a one standard deviation increment was 0.69 (95% CI 0.50-0.95; test for linear trend, p = 0.02). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation of CpGs within functional promoters was associated with an increased risk, whereas epigenome-wide DNA methylation of genomic regions outside promoters was associated with decreased risk (test for heterogeneity, p = 0.0002). The increased risk associated with epigenome-wide DNA methylation in functional promoters did not vary by time between blood collection and diagnosis, whereas the inverse association with epigenome-wide DNA methylation outside functional promoters was strongest when the interval from blood collection to diagnosis was less than 5 years and weakest for the longest interval.

To date, only snapshots of different mouse and human cell types have been generated, providing a static view on DNA methylation. To enable monitoring of methylation status as it changes over time, we establish a reporter of genomic methylation (RGM) that relies on a minimal imprinted gene promoter driving a fluorescent protein. We show that insertion of RGM proximal to promoter-associated CpG islands reports the gain or loss of DNA methylation. We further utilized RGM to report endogenous methylation dynamics of non-coding regulatory elements, such as the pluripotency-specific super enhancers of Sox2 and miR290. Loci-specific DNA methylation changes and their correlation with transcription were visualized during cell-state transition following differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and during reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. RGM will allow the investigation of dynamic methylation changes during development and disease at single-cell resolution.",32.242,325

Curiously, however, prostatic bud initiation lags behind the onset of gonadal testosterone synthesis by about three days. This study's objective was to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation controls the timing and scope of prostate ductal development by regulating Ar expression in the urogenital sinus (UGS) from which the prostate derives. We determined that Ar DNA methylation decreases in UGS mesenchyme during prostate bud formation in vivo and that this change correlates with decreased DNA methyltransferase expression in the same cell population during the same time period. To examine the role of DNA methylation in prostate development, fetal UGSs were grown in serum-free medium and 5 alpha dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the DNA methylation inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC) were introduced into the medium at specific times. As a measure of prostate development, in situ hybridization was used to visualize and count Nkx3-1 mRNA positive prostatic buds. We determined that inhibiting DNA methylation when prostatic buds are being specified, accelerates the onset of prostatic bud development, increases bud number, and sensitizes the budding response to androgens. Inhibition of DNA methylation also reduces Ar DNA methylation in UGS explants and increases Ar mRNA and protein in UGS mesenchyme and epithelium. Together, these results support a novel mechanism whereby Ar DNA methylation regulates UGS androgen sensitivity to control the rate and number of prostatic buds formed, thereby establishing a developmental checkpoint.",3.547,1408

We investigate the genome-wide methylation profile of 250 samples including 125 EAC, 19 Barrett's esophagus (BE), 85 squamous esophagus and 21 normal stomach. Transcriptome data of 70 samples (48 EAC, 4 BE and 18 squamous esophagus) were used to identify changes in methylation associated with gene expression. BE and EAC showed similar methylation profiles, which differed from squamous tissue. Hypermethylated sites in EAC and BE were mainly located in CpG-rich promoters. A total of 18575 CpG sites associated with 5538 genes were differentially methylated, 63% of these genes showed significant correlation between methylation and mRNA expression levels. Pathways involved in tumorigenesis including cell adhesion, TGF and WNT signaling showed enrichment for genes aberrantly methylated. Genes involved in chromosomal segregation and spindle formation were aberrantly methylated. Given the recent evidence that chromothripsis may be a driver mechanism in EAC, the role of epigenetic perturbation of these pathways should be further investigated. The methylation profiles revealed two EAC subtypes, one associated with widespread CpG island hypermethylation overlapping H3K27me3 marks and binding sites of the Polycomb proteins. These subtypes were supported by an independent set of 89 esophageal cancer samples. The most hypermethylated tumors showed worse patient survival.",5.334,158

However, there was no report on the correlation of genome-wide DNA methylation with survival benefit from chemotherapy in NSCLC. METHODS: A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was first established, optimized and validated. A total of 191 NSCLC samples were analyzed using the sandwich ELISA for the association between the relative genome-wide DNA methylation level and the survival outcomes from chemotherapy. RESULTS: The analytical performance of the sandwich ELISA method was satisfying and suitable for analysis. Using the sandwich ELISA method, we found that the genome-wide DNA methylation level in NSCLC cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissues, which further validated the assay. We found that there was no significant correlation between genome-wide DNA methylation level and patients' histology, stage and progression free survivals. However, in patients with high methylation level, those without chemotherapy had significantly better overall survival than those receiving chemotherapy. In patients receiving chemotherapy, those with low genome-wide DNA methylation level had significantly better overall survival than those with relatively high DNA methylation level.

Active demethylation of the paternal genome occurs in the zygote, passive demethylation occurs during cleavage stages, and de novo methylation occurs by the blastocyst stage. It is believed that the paternal genome has lower levels of methylation during early development than the maternal genome. However, in this study, we provide direct and indirect evidence of genome-wide de novo DNA methylation of the paternal genome after the first cell cycle in mouse embryos. Although very little methylation was detected within the male pronucleus in zygotes, an intense methylation signal was clearly visible within the androgenetic 2-cell embryos. Moreover, the DNA methylation level of the paternal genome in the post-zygotic metaphase embryos was similar to that of the maternal genome. Using indirect immunofluorescence with an antibody to methylated lysine 9 in histone H3, we provided new evidence to support the concept of spatial compartmentalization of parental genomes in 2-cell mouse embryos. Nevertheless, the transient segregation of parental genomes was not observed by determining the DNA methylation distribution in the 2-cell embryos even though DNA methylation asymmetry between the maternal and paternal pronucleus existed in the 1-cell stage. The disappearance of separate immunofluorescence signals of 5-methyl cytosine in the 2-cell embryos might be attributed to the de novo methylation of the paternal genome during the first mitotic cycle.",0.775,1688

The expression of the 2 genes was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in 10 methylation-positive and 10 methylation-negative cervical tissues. We found that both HS3ST2 and CCNA1 genes were methylated in 38 of the 40 cervical cancer tissues, 9 of the 10 CIN3, and 6 of the 10 CIN2. In contrast, methylation of these 2 genes was found in only 1 of the 40 normal tissues and none of 10 CIN1. Furthermore, hypermethylated HS3ST2 and CCNA1 genes were correlated with infection with HPV16 and HPV18 in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and cervical cancer (both p<0.05). The expression of HS3ST2 and CCNA1 genes was lower in the methylation-positive cervical tissues than in the methylation-negative cervical tissues.

Memory T cells are heterogeneous populations. Human effector memory (EM) CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood contain two cell subsets with distinct traits that express low and high levels of the IL-7Ralpha. However, epigenetic mechanisms involved in defining such cellular traits are largely unknown. In this study, we use genome-wide DNA methylation and individual gene expression to show the possible role of DNA methylation in conferring distinct traits of chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in human IL-7Ralpha(low) and IL-7Ralpha(high) EM CD8(+) T cells. In particular, IL-7Ralpha(low) EM CD8(+) T cells had increased expression of CX3CR1 along with decreased DNA methylation in the CX3CR1 gene promoter compared with IL-7Ralpha(high) EM CD8(+) T cells. Altering the DNA methylation status of the CX3CR1 gene promoter changed its activity and gene expression. IL-7Ralpha(low) EM CD8(+) T cells had an increased migratory capacity to the CX3CR1 ligand fractalkine compared with IL-7Ralpha(high) EM CD8(+) T cells, suggesting an important biological outcome of the differential expression of CX3CR1. Moreover, IL-7Ralpha(low) EM CD8(+) T cells induced fractalkine expression on endothelial cells by producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, forming an autocrine amplification loop. Overall, our study shows the role of DNA methylation in generating unique cellular traits in human IL-7Ralpha(low) and IL-7Ralpha(high) EM CD8(+) T cells, including differential expression of CX3CR1, as well as potential biological implications of this differential expression.",1.82,514

A cross-sectional study was conducted in which the methylation status of DAPK, CDKN2A (p16) and RASSF1A genes in sputum and bronchial washing (BW) from subjects at risk for LC was analyzed. The methylation results of both samples were compared, considering BW as the reference. Results obtained by methylation-sensitive PCR (MSP) were validated by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM). The methylation results obtained in sputum and BW samples did not show statistically significant differences for any of the three genes analyzed in 65 subjects (McNemar test>0.05). Concordant results between sputum and BW were found in 40 patients for DAPK (61%), in 52 patients for p16 (80%) and in 63 patients for RASSF1 (97%). More methylated samples were found in BW, however, and sputum sensitivities and specificities for the identification of methylation status were 44 and 72% for DAPK gene, 21 and 94% for p16 and 100 and 98% for RASSF1A, respectively. When MSP results were validated by MS-HRM, DAPK and p16 gene samples methylated by MSP appeared to be unmethylated by MS-HRM. One sample showing methylation of RASSF1A gene also showed methylation when tested following MS-HRM procedure. Sputum and BW samples may be considered equally valid for the identification of methylated genes in bronchial secretions. The low sensitivity of sputum for the assessment of the methylation status of DAPK and p16 genes, however, suggests that the analysis of two or more sputum samples, or of a BW obtained semi-invasively, would be needed to attain higher reliability, together with the use of confirmatory techniques for positive results.",2.301,1692

This pilot study examined the association between socioeconomic status (SES), attachment, and methylation of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). METHODS: Attachment classification and SLC6A4 methylation was determined in 100 late adolescents. We hypothesized that (1) SES would interact with methylation to predict higher unresolved loss (UL) or trauma scores on the Adult Attachment Interview; (2) across SES, participants with unresolved attachment would have lower levels of methylation than organized or secure participants; and (3) within the unresolved classification, SES would predict methylation. RESULTS: Results showed that lower methylation and low-SES were associated with higher UL, and higher methylation and low-SES were associated with higher unresolved trauma. Across SES, unresolved participants had lower levels of methylation than organized participants. Within the unresolved category, low-SES unresolved participants had higher levels of methylation than mid/upper-SES participants. SES was unrelated to methylation within the secure and organized categories. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the quality of attachment relationships may impact epigenetic processes.",2.243,524

A nested case-control study was conducted to investigate the importance of cervical cell folate concentration and tumour suppressor gene methylation as risk factors for HR-HPV persistence. METHODS: Cervical cell samples from 955 women with HR-HPV infection and normal, borderline or mild dyskaryosis were retrieved from the archive of a population-based screening trial. Women were classified as cases or controls, reflecting the presence or absence [respectively] of any HR-HPV infection at a follow-up clinic at least 6 months from baseline. Cervical cell folate concentration and promoter methylation of five tumour suppressor genes were measured in independent samples from cases and controls. RESULTS: A higher cervical cell folate concentration [P = 0.015] was an independent predictor of infection at follow-up, together with infection with HPV-16 or infection with multiple HR-HPV types. Methylation of the tumour suppressor gene DAPK was associated with a 2.64-fold [95% CI, 1.35-5.17] increased likelihood of HPV infection whilst CDH1 methylation was associated with a 0.53-fold [95% CI, 0.331-0.844] likelihood of HR-HPV infection at follow-up. When considering women with normal or abnormal cytology, the predictive effect of higher cervical cell folate was only seen in women with mild cytology [P = 0.021]; similarly the effect of DAPK methylation was seen in women with mild or borderline cytology [P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Higher cervical cell folate concentration and promoter methylation of the tumour suppressor gene, DAPK, in women with cervical cell dyskaryosis, are associated with increased risk of HR-HPV persistence.",3.362,1949

Until now structural information about this enzyme family was only available for the catalytic SPOUT domain of Trm10 proteins that show specificity toward guanosine. Here, we present the first crystal structure of a full length Trm10 orthologue specific for adenosine, revealing next to the catalytic SPOUT domain also N- and C-terminal domains. This structure hence provides crucial insights in the tRNA binding mechanism of this unique monomeric family of SPOUT methyltransferases.

The objective of this study was to quantify methylation within a select panel of genes previously identified as targets for epigenetic silencing in cervical cancer and to identify genes with elevated methylation that can distinguish cancer from normal cervical tissues. We identified 49 women with invasive squamous cell cancer of the cervix and 22 women with normal cytology specimens. Bisulfite-modified genomic DNA was amplified and quantitative pyrosequencing completed for 10 genes (APC, CCNA, CDH1, CDH13, WIF1, TIMP3, DAPK1, RARB, FHIT, and SLIT2). A Methylation Index was calculated as the mean percent methylation across all CpG sites analyzed per gene (~4-9 CpG site) per sequence. A binary cut-point was defined at >15% methylation. Sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve (AUC) of methylation in individual genes or a panel was examined. The median methylation index was significantly higher in cases compared to controls in 8 genes, whereas there was no difference in median methylation for 2 genes. Compared to HPV and age, the combination of DNA methylation level of DAPK1, SLIT2, WIF1 and RARB with HPV and age significantly improved the AUC from 0.79 to 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00, p-value = 0.003). Pyrosequencing analysis confirmed that several genes are common targets for aberrant methylation in cervical cancer and DNA methylation level of four genes appears to increase specificity to identify cancer compared to HPV detection alone. Alterations in DNA methylation of specific genes in cervical cancers, such as DAPK1, RARB, WIF1, and SLIT2, may also occur early in cervical carcinogenesis and should be evaluated.",3.234,1165

We sought to test whether prenatal dietary supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy may modulate epigenetic states at birth. This study was based on a randomized intervention trial conducted in Mexican pregnant women supplemented daily with 400 mg of DHA or a placebo from gestation week 18-22 to parturition. We applied quantitative profiling of DNA methylation states at IGF2 promoter 3 (IGF2 P3), IGF2 differentially methylated region (DMR), and H19 DMR in cord blood mononuclear cells of the DHA-supplemented group (n = 131) and the control group (n = 130). In stratified analyses, DNA methylation levels in IGF2 P3 were significantly higher in the DHA group than the control group in preterm infants (P = 0.04). We also observed a positive association between DNA methylation levels and maternal body mass index; IGF2 DMR methylation was higher in the DHA group than the control group in infants of overweight mothers (P = 0.03). In addition, at H19 DMR, methylation levels were significantly lower in the DHA group than the control group in infants of normal weight mothers (P = 0.01). Finally, methylation levels at IGF2/H19 imprinted regions were associated with maternal BMI. These findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may be modulated by DHA, with potential impacts on child growth and development.",2.374,1824

The present study provides evidence for the involvement of radioresistance-induced DNA methylation changes in tumor radioresistance. We established radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells via long-term fractionated irradiation, and examined differences in DNA methylation between control and radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that the promoter-CpG islands of 5 previously identified radioresistance-related genes (TOPO2A, PLXDC2, ETNK2, GFI1, and IL12B) were significantly altered in the radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells. Furthermore, the demethylation of these gene promoters with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) increased their transcription levels. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine also sensitized the radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells to irradiation, indicating that changes in DNA methylation contributed to their radioresistance. Of the tested genes, the expression and activity levels of TOPO2A were tightly associated with the radioresistant phenotype in our system, suggesting that the hypermethylation of TOPO2A might be involved in this radioresistance. Collectively, our data suggest that radiation-induced epigenetic changes can modulate the radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells, and thus may prove useful as prognostic indicators for radiotherapy.",3.072,1183

It is well known that DNA methylation plays an important role in gene expression regulation during biological development in wheat. However, no reports are available on DNA methylation affected by different male sterile cytoplasms in hybrid wheat. We employed a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism technique to characterize nuclear DNA methylation in three male sterile cytoplasms. A and B lines share the same nucleus, but have different cytoplasms which is male sterile for the A and fertile for the B. The results revealed a relationship of DNA methylation at these sites specifically with male sterile cytoplasms, as well as male sterility, since the only difference between the A lines and B line was the cytoplasm. The DNA methylation was markedly affected by male sterile cytoplasms. K-type cytoplasm affected the methylation to a much greater degree than T-type and S-type cytoplasms, as indicated by the ratio of methylated sites, ratio of fully methylated sites, and polymorphism between A lines and B line for these cytoplasms. The genetic distance between the cytoplasm and nucleus for the K-type is much greater than for the T- and S-types because the former is between Aegilops genus and Triticum genus and the latter is within Triticum genus between Triticum spelta and Triticum timopheevii species. Thus, this difference in genetic distance may be responsible for the variation in methylation that we observed.",2.138,1339

Despite recent reports confirming the presence of low DNA methylation in Drosophila; little is known about the methyltransferase. Therefore, in this study, we have aimed to investigate the possible functioning of DNA methyltransferase in Drosophila. The 14 K oligo microarray slide was incubated with native cell extract from adult Drosophila to check the presence of the methyltransferase activity. After incubation under appropriate conditions, the methylated oligo sequences were identified by the binding of anti 5-methylcytosine monoclonal antibody. The antibody bound to the methylated oligos was detected using Cy3 labeled secondary antibody. Methylation sensitive restriction enzyme mediated PCR was used to assess the methylation at a few selected loci identified on the array. It could be seen that a few of the total oligos got methylated under the assay conditions. Analysis of methylated oligo sequences provides evidence for the presence of de novo methyltransferase activity and allows identification of its sequence specificity in adult Drosophila. With the help of methylation sensitive enzymes we could detect presence of CpC methylation in the selected genomic regions. This study reports presence of an active DNA methyltransferase in adult Drosophila, which exhibits sequence specificity confirmed by presence of asymmetric methylation at corresponding sites in the genomic DNA. It also provides an innovative approach to investigate methylation specificity of a native methyltransferase.",2.024,114

This study simultaneously investigated associations of smoking-associated and LC-related methylation markers with LC mortality. DNA methylation was determined by HM450K assay in baseline blood samples of 1,565 older adults in a population-based case-cohort study. The associations of 151 smoking-associated CpGs (smoCpGs) and 3,806 LC-related CpGs (caCpGs) with LC mortality were assessed by weighted Cox regression models, controlling for potential confounders. Multi-loci methylation scores were separately constructed based on smoCpGs and caCpGs. During a median follow-up of 13.8 years, 60 participants who had a first diagnosis of LC died from LC. The average time between sample collection and LC diagnosis was 5.8 years. Hypomethylation at 77 smoCpGs and 121 caCpGs, and hypermethylation at 4 smoCpGs and 66 caCpGs were associated with LC mortality. The associations were much stronger for smoCpGs than for caCpGs. Hazard ratios (95% CI) were 7.82 (2.91-21.00) and 2.27 (0.75-6.85), respectively, for participants in highest quartile of Score I (based on 81 smoCpGs) and Score II (based on 187 caCpGs), compared with participants in the corresponding lower three quartiles. Score I outperformed Score II, with an optimism-corrected C-index of 0.87 vs. 0.77. In conclusion, although methylation changes of both smoking-associated and LC-related genes are associated with LC mortality, only smoking-associated methylation markers predict LC mortality with high accuracy, and may thus serve as promising candidates to identify high risk populations for LC screening.",5.085,424

The relationship between renal function and indicators of As methylation capacity has not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVES: Our two aims were to examine (1) associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and %As metabolites in blood and urine, and (2) whether renal function modifies the relationship of blood %As metabolites with respective urinary %As metabolites. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 375 As-exposed Bangladeshi adults, we measured blood and urinary As metabolites, and calculated eGFR from plasma cystatin C. RESULTS: In covariate-adjusted linear models, a 1 ml/min/1.73 m(2) increase in eGFR was associated with a 0.39% increase in urinary %InAs (p<0.0001) and a mean decrease in urinary %DMA of 0.07 (p=0.0005). In the 292 participants with measurable blood As metabolites, the associations of eGFR with increased blood %InAs and decreased blood %DMA did not reach statistical significance. eGFR was not associated with urinary or blood %MMA in covariate-adjusted models. For a given increase in blood %InAs, the increase in urinary %InAs was smaller in those with reduced eGFR, compared to those with normal eGFR (p=0.06); this effect modification was not observed for %MMA or %DMA. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary excretion of InAs may be impaired in individuals with reduced renal function. Alternatively, increased As methylation capacity (as indicated by decreased urinary %InAs) may be detrimental to renal function.",4.373,62

Water column, sediment, and pore water concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (THg), as well as related aquatic chemical parameters were examined. Inorganic Hg(II)-methylation rates were determined in selected water column and sediment subsamples spiked with inorganic divalent mercury (204Hg(II)). Net production of Me204Hg was expressed as apparent first-order rate constants for methylation (kmeth), which were also expanded to MeHg production potential (MPP) rates via combination with tin reducible 'reactive' Hg(II) (Hg(II)R) as a proxy for bioavailable Hg(II). Notable findings include: 1) elevated Hg concentrations previously reported in birds and brine flies were spatially proximal to the measured highest MeHg concentrations, the latter occurring in the anoxic deep brine layer (DBL) of the Great Salt Lake; 2) timing of reduced Hg(II)-methylation rates in the DBL (according to both kmeth and MPP) coincides with reduced Hg burdens among aquatic invertebrates (brine shrimp and brine flies) that act as potential vectors of Hg propagation to the terrestrial ecosystem; 3) values of kmeth were found to fall within the range reported by other studies; and 4) MPP rates were on the lower end of the range reported in methodologically comparable studies, suggesting the possibility that elevated MeHg in the anoxic deep brine layer results from its accumulation and persistence in this quasi-isolated environment, due to the absence of light (restricting abiotic photo demethylation) and/or minimal microbiological demethylation.",0,404

Assessment of aberrant DNA methylation in urine might complement currently used clinical prognostic factors and serve as a noninvasive tool for early prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Promoter methylation of 7 genes was evaluated by methylation sensitive polymerase chain reaction in 149 prostate cancer tissues, 37 noncancerous prostate tissues and 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for DNA methylation analysis of the urine of 253 patients with prostate cancer and 32 with benign prostatic hyperplasia. RESULTS: In prostate cancer tissue the most frequently methylated genes were RASSF1, GSTP1 and RARB, which combined were positively identified in 85% of cases. These genes were also methylated in the urine of 60% of patients with prostate cancer. RASSF1 was methylated in 45% of prostate cancer urine samples with methylation intensity significantly higher in prostate cancer than in benign prostatic hyperplasia cases (p = 0.018). In a univariate model RASSF1 methylation and the total number of methylated genes in prostate cancer tissue were predictive of time to biochemical recurrence (p = 0.019 and 0.043, respectively). On multivariate analysis RASSF1 methylation together with pathological stage was the most significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in patients with Gleason score 6 tumors when analyzed in tissue and urine (p </=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of RASSF1 in cancerous tissue and urine from patients with prostate cancer correlated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

In animal models, early environmental cues affect neuropsychological phenotypes via epigenetic processes but, as yet, there is little direct evidence for such mechanisms in humans. METHOD: We examined the relation between DNA methylation at birth and child neuropsychological outcomes in two culturally diverse populations using a genome-wide methylation analysis and validation by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Within the UK Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) we first identified 41 differentially methylated regions of interest (DMROI) at birth associated with child's full-scale IQ at age 4 years. Associations between HES1 DMROI methylation and later cognitive function were confirmed by pyrosequencing in 175 SWS children. Consistent with these findings, higher HES1 methylation was associated with higher executive memory function in a second independent group of 200 SWS 7-year-olds. Finally, we examined a pathway for this relationship within a Singaporean cohort (n = 108). Here, HES1 DMROI methylation predicted differences in early infant behaviour, known to be associated with academic success. In vitro, methylation of HES1 inhibited ETS transcription factor binding, suggesting a functional role of this site. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our findings suggest that perinatal epigenetic processes mark later neurocognitive function and behaviour, providing support for a role of epigenetic processes in mediating the long-term consequences of early life environment on cognitive development.",9.176,251

The aim of this study is to prospectively determine if early P16 methylation is a predictor for oral cancer development. METHODS: Patients (n = 181) with mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) were recruited into the double blind multicentre cohort. P16 methylation was analyzed using the MethyLight assay. Progression of OEDs was monitored for a minimum 3 year follow-up period. FINDINGS: P16 methylation-informative cases (n = 152) were enrolled in the prospective multicenter cohorts with an ultimate compliance of 96.7%. OED-derived squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 21 patients (14.3%) during the follow-up (median, 41.0 months). The cancer progression rate from the P16 methylation-positive patients was significantly increased when compared to P16 methylation-negative patients [27.1% vs 8.1%; adjusted odds ratio = 4.6; P = 0.006]. When the P16 methylation-positive criteria were used as a biomarker for early prediction of cancer development from OEDs, sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 76% were obtained, respectively.

As aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterning has been shown to play a role in leukaemogenesis, we studied the promoter methylation, expression profiles and molecular functions of PTPRD in paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: Bone marrow specimens were obtained from 32 Chinese patients with a mean age of 7.2 years (range 1.1-16.5). PTPRD and methylation status were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation-specific PCR. Western blot and flow cytometry techniques were also used. RESULTS: PTPRD expression was decreased by promoter region methylation in six AML cells and methylated in 21 (65.6%) of the 32 samples. In addition, PTPRD expression could be induced by the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, functional studies showed that overexpression of PTPRD in AML cells inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity as well as inducing apoptosis. However, PTPRD knockdown increased cell proliferation. These effects were associated with downregulation of cyclin D1, c-myc and upregulation of Bax. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that PTPRD was a potential tumour suppressor gene inactivated by DNA methylation in paediatric AML.",0,1491

Abnormal epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modification play an important role in tumor initiation, progression and regulation of cancer-related genes such as integrin alpha4 and E-cadherin. Expression of these genes was determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR in prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, before and after treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A. Laser capture microdissection microscopy was used to obtain exclusively affected epithelial cells from prostate gland biopsies of 30 patients with prostate cancer and 40 with benign prostate hyperplasia. DNA bisulfite modifications followed by methylation-specific PCR were used to evaluate the promoter methylation status of E-cadherin and alpha4 integrin genes in extracted DNA from patients and aforementioned cell lines. The integrin alpha4 promoter in DU145 was fully methylated, whereas in PC3 cells, partial methylation was detected. E-cadherin was expressed in both cell lines; trichostatin A and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment had no effect on E-cadherin expression, however the combined treatment of both drugs or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine alone increased integrin alpha4 expression. Integrin alpha4 and E-cadherin were hypermethylated in 66.6 % and 6.6 % of prostate cancer cases, respectively; no hypermethylation was observed in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. These results together suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms involved in integrin alpha4 expression and may play an important role in human prostate carcinogenesis. In addition, the higher rate of integrin alpha4 gene methylation in prostate cancer patients elects it as a potential molecular tumor marker.",1.855,500

Many genomic regions that may be the targets for clinical diagnostic assays have been identified through use of measuring systems reliant on bisulphite conversion, but few of these promising markers are in clinical use. The comparability of a widely used DNA methylation measuring system involving bisulphite conversion was evaluated by supplying three experienced centres with methylated DNA reference material mixtures that were independently prepared and characterised by mass spectrometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography. A replication scheme was designed to evaluate reproducibility of key analytical steps within and between laboratories by regression analysis. In general, methylation was underestimated and methylation ratio values were highly variable. The difference in methylation ratio between CpG sites was the key contributor to variable results. The CpG site effect followed a similar pattern at all centres and at all methylation levels examined indicating that sequence context had a major effect on methylation ratio measurement using the bisulphite conversion process. The magnitude of underestimation combined with the variability of measurements between CpG sites compromises the concept of measuring genomic regional methylation by averaging the methylation ratios of many CpG sites. There were no significant differences in replicate bisulphite conversions or sample work-up and instrument analysis at each centre thus making this technique suitable for comparative intralaboratory investigations. However, it may not be suitable for a routine diagnostic assay without extensive standardisation efforts.",3.436,1716

Placental mtDNA content has been shown to respond to environmental exposures that induce oxidative stress, including airborne particulate matter (PM). Damaged or non-functioning mitochondria are specifically degraded through mitophagy, exemplified by lower mtDNA content, and could be primed by epigenetic modifications in the mtDNA. We studied placental mtDNA methylation in the context of the early life exposome. We investigated placental tissue from 381 mother-newborn pairs that were enrolled in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. We determined mtDNA methylation by bisulfite-pyrosequencing in 2 regions, i.e., the D-loop control region and 12S rRNA (MT-RNR1), and measured mtDNA content by qPCR. PM2.5 exposure was calculated for each participant's home address using a dispersion model. An interquartile range (IQR) increment in PM2.5 exposure over the entire pregnancy was positively associated with mtDNA methylation (MT-RNR1: +0.91%, P = 0.01 and D-loop: +0.21%, P = 0.05) and inversely associated with mtDNA content (relative change of -15.60%, P = 0.001) in placental tissue. mtDNA methylation was estimated to mediate 54% [P = 0.01 (MT-RNR1)] and 27% [P = 0.06 (D-loop)] of the inverse association between PM2.5 exposure and mtDNA content. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms of altered mitochondrial function in the early life environment. Epigenetic modifications in the mitochondrial genome, especially in the MT-RNR1 region, substantially mediate the association between PM2.5 exposure during gestation and placental mtDNA content, which could reflect signs of mitophagy and mitochondrial death.",4.78,828

Here we show that HIF-1alpha is methylated by SET7/9 methyltransferase, and that lysine-specific demethylase 1 reverses its methylation. The functional consequence of HIF-1alpha methylation is the modulation of HIF-1alpha stability primarily in the nucleus, independent of its proline hydroxylation, during long-term hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Knock-in mice bearing a methylation-defective Hif1a(KA/KA) allele exhibit enhanced retinal angiogenesis and tumour vascularization via HIF-1alpha stabilization. Importantly, S28Y and R30Q mutations of HIF-1alpha, found in human cancers, are involved in the altered HIF-1alpha stability. Together, these results demonstrate a role for HIF-1alpha methylation in regulating protein stability, thereby modulating biological output including retinal and tumour angiogenesis, with therapeutic implications in human cancer.",11.47,28

Palliative chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced gastric cancer. It is necessary to compare the effectiveness and toxicities of different regimens. This study explores the possibility of methylation of DNA damage repair genes serving as a prognostic and chemo-sensitive marker in human gastric cancer. METHODS: The methylation status of five DNA damage repair genes (CHFR, FANCF, MGMT, MLH1, and RASSF1A) was detected by nested methylation-specific PCR in 102 paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the association of methylation status and clinic-pathological factors. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to analyze the association of methylation status and chemo-sensitivity. RESULTS: The results indicate that CHFR, MLH1, RASSF1A, MGMT, and FANCF were methylated in 34.3% (35/102), 21.6% (22/102), 12.7% (13/102), 9.8% (10/102), and 0% (0/102) of samples, respectively. No association was found between methylation of CHFR, MLH1, RASSF1A, MGMT, or FANCF with gender, age, tumor size, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. In docetaxel-treated gastric cancer patients, resistance to docetaxel was found in CHFR unmethylated patients by Cox proportional hazards model (HR 0.243, 95% CI, 0.069-0.859, p = 0.028), and overall survival is longer in the CHFR methylated group compared with the CHFR unmethylated group (log-rank, p = 0.036). In oxaliplatin-treated gastric cancer patients, resistance to oxaliplatin was found in MLH1 methylated patients (HR 2.988, 95% CI, 1.064-8.394, p = 0.038), and overall survival was longer in the MLH1 unmethylated group compared with the MLH1 methylated group (log-rank, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: CHFR is frequently methylated in human gastric cancer, and CHFR methylation may serve as a docetaxel-sensitive marker. MLH1 methylation was related to oxaliplatin resistance in gastric cancer patients.",0,743

 Society for Autism Research",2016,"LAY ABSTRACT: The gene encoding the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), localized on chromosome 3p25, is considered a promising candidate for explaining genetic vulnerability to autistic traits. Although several lines of evidence implicate OXTR SNP rs53576 (G/A) variation in social behavior, findings have been inconsistent, possibly because DNA methylation after stress exposure was eliminated from consideration. This study investigated the main and interactive effects of OXTR rs53576 genotype, stress exposure, and OXTR methylation on child autistic traits. Prenatal maternal stress exposure, but not OXTR rs53576 genotype and OXTR methylation, showed a main effect on child autistic traits. For child autistic traits in general and social communication problems in particular, we observed a significant OXTR rs53576 genotype by OXTR methylation interaction. More specifically, OXTR methylation levels were positively associated with social problems for OXTR rs53576 G-allele homozygous children but not for A-allele carriers. These results highlight the importance of incorporating epi-allelic information and support the role of OXTR methylation in child autistic traits. SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACT: Findings of studies investigating OXTR SNP rs53576 (G-A) variation in social behavior have been inconsistent, possibly because DNA methylation after stress exposure was eliminated from consideration. Our goal was to examine OXTR rs53576 allele-specific sensitivity for neonatal OXTR DNA methylation in relation to (1) a prenatal maternal stress composite, and (2) child autistic traits. Prospective data from fetal life to age 6 years were collected in a total of 743 children participating in the Generation R Study. Prenatal maternal stress exposure was uniquely associated with child autistic traits but was unrelated to OXTR methylation across both OXTR rs53576 G-allele homozygous children and A-allele carriers. For child autistic traits in general and social communication problems in particular, we observed a significant OXTR rs53576 genotype by OXTR methylation interaction in the absence of main effects, suggesting that opposing effects cancelled each other out. Indeed, OXTR methylation levels were positively associated with social problems for OXTR rs53576 G-allele homozygous children but not for A-allele carriers. These results highlight the importance of incorporating epi-allelic information and support the role of OXTR methylation in child autistic traits. Autism Res 2016.

METHODS: A total of 35 FMR1 PM women aged between 22 and 55 years and 35 age- and IQ-matched women controls (CGG <45) participated in this study. All participants completed a range of executive function tests and self-reported symptoms of psychiatric disorders. The molecular measures included DNA methylation of the FMR1 CpG island in blood, presented as FMR1 activation ratio (AR), and 9 CpG sites located at the FMR1 exon1/intron 1 boundary, CGG size, and FMR1 mRNA levels. RESULTS: We show that FMR1 intron 1 methylation levels could be used to dichotomize PM women into greater and lower risk categories (p = 0.006 to 0.037; odds ratio = 14-24.8), with only FMR1 intron 1 methylation, and to a lesser extent AR, being significantly correlated with the likelihood of probable dysexecutive or psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the significant relationships between methylation and social anxiety were found to be mediated by executive function performance, but only in PM women. FMR1 exon 1 methylation, CGG size, and FMR1 mRNA could not predict probable dysexecutive/psychiatric disorders in PM women. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study supporting presence of specific epigenetic etiology associated with increased risk of developing comorbid dysexecutive and social anxiety symptoms in PM women. These findings could have implications for early intervention and risk estimate recommendations aimed at improving the outcomes for PM women and their families.",8.286,1708

During this histone-to-protamine switch, transition proteins are expressed, for example TNP1 and TNP2 in mammals and Tpl94D in Drosophila. Recently, we demonstrated that in Drosophila spermatids, H3K79 methylation accompanies histone H4 hyperacetylation during chromatin reorganization. Preceding the histone-to-protamine transition, the H3K79 methyltransferase Grappa is expressed, and the predominant isoform bears a C-terminal extension. Here, we show that isoforms of the Grappa-equivalent protein in humans, rats and mice, that is DOT1L, have a C-terminal extension. In mice, the transcript of this isoform was enriched in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. In human and mice spermatids, di- and tri-methylated H3K79 temporally overlapped with hyperacetylated H4 and thus accompanied chromatin reorganization. In rat spermatids, trimethylated H3K79 directly preceded transition protein loading on chromatin. We analysed the impact of bacterial infections on spermatid chromatin using a uropathogenic Escherichia coli-elicited epididymo-orchitis rat model and showed that these infections caused aberrant spermatid chromatin. Bacterial infections led to premature emergence of trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated H4. Trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated H4 simultaneously occurred with transition protein TNP1, which was never observed in spermatids of mock-infected rats. Upon bacterial infection, only histone-based spermatid chromatin showed abnormalities, whereas protamine-compacted chromatin seemed to be unaffected. Our results indicated that H3K79 methylation is a histone modification conserved in Drosophila, mouse, rat and human spermatids and may be a prerequisite for proper chromatin reorganization.",2.298,1664

Recent epidemiological studies link exposure to pollutants that bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) during development with poorer immune responses later in life. Yet, how developmental triggering of AHR durably alters immune cell function remains unknown. Using a mouse model, we show that developmental activation of AHR leads to long-lasting reduction in the response of CD8(+) T cells during influenza virus infection, cells critical for resolving primary infection. Combining genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that developmental activation alters DNA methylation and gene expression patterns in isolated CD8(+) T cells prior to and during infection. Altered transcriptional profiles in CD8(+) T cells from developmentally exposed mice reflect changes in pathways involved in proliferation and immunoregulation, with an overall pattern that bears hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Developmental exposure also changed DNA methylation across the genome, but differences were most pronounced following infection, where we observed inverse correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression. This points to altered regulation of DNA methylation as one mechanism by which AHR causes durable changes in T cell function. Discovering that distinct gene sets and pathways were differentially changed in developmentally exposed mice prior to and after infection further reveals that the process of CD8(+) T cell activation is rendered fundamentally different by early life AHR signaling. These findings reveal a novel role for AHR in the developing immune system: regulating DNA methylation and gene expression as T cells respond to infection later in life.",1.82,1513

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the epigenetic mechanism involved in the repression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression by puerarin under high glucose (25mM) condition. MAIN METHODS: MCP-1 gene expression was measured by Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), the histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) and lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) were evaluated using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. KEY FINDINGS: Puerarin significantly inhibited high glucose-induced upregulation of H3K4 di- and tri-methylation (H3K4me2/3) on the MCP-1 gene promotor. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K4 histone methyltransferases including MLL, menin and SET7 on the MCP-1 promotor was increased, while the demethylase LSD1 was decreased in EA.hy926 cells following exposure to high glucose. The changes of the above enzymes were reversed by puerarin treatment. The mRNA expression of MCP-1 was increased by LSD1 blockage, while was decreased by MLL3 blockage. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggested that puerarin plays a critical role in transcriptional repression of high glucose-induced MCP-1 gene expression, at least in part due to alteration of H3K4me2/3 methylation, thus possesses a therapeutic potential in diabetes-induced vascular injuries.",2.702,87

We not only revealed genome-wide methylation patterns for psoriasis but also identified strong associations between the skin-specific DNA methylation of nine disease-associated differentially methylated sites and psoriasis (Wilcoxon ranked PBonferroni < 0.01; methylation level difference > 0.10). Further analysis revealed that these nine disease-associated differentially methylated sites were not significantly affected by genetic variations, supporting their remarkable contributions to disease status. The expression of CYP2S1, ECE1, EIF2C2, MAN1C1, and DLGAP4 was negatively correlated with DNA methylation.

RESULTS: We use whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and find that differentiation of mouse colonic intestinal stem cells to intestinal epithelium is not associated with major changes in DNA methylation. However, we detect extensive dynamic epigenetic changes in intestinal stem cells and their progeny during the suckling period, suggesting postnatal epigenetic development in this stem cell population. We find that postnatal DNA methylation increases at 3' CpG islands (CGIs) correlate with transcriptional activation of glycosylation genes responsible for intestinal maturation. To directly test whether 3' CGI methylation regulates transcription, we conditionally disrupted two major DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a, in fetal and adult intestine. Deficiency of Dnmt1 causes severe intestinal abnormalities in neonates and disrupts crypt homeostasis in adults, whereas Dnmt3a loss was compatible with intestinal development. These studies reveal that 3' CGI methylation is functionally involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation in vivo, and that Dnmt1 is a critical regulator of postnatal epigenetic changes in intestinal stem cells. Finally, we show that postnatal 3' CGI methylation and associated gene activation in intestinal epithelial cells are significantly altered by germ-free conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the suckling period is critical for epigenetic development of intestinal stem cells, with potential important implications for lifelong gut health, and that the gut microbiome guides and/or facilitates these postnatal epigenetic processes.",10.81,511

A variety of methods have been established to interrogate the cytosine methylation patterns in cells. Reduced representation of whole genome bisulfite sequencing was developed to detect quantitative base pair resolution cytosine methylation patterns at GC-rich genomic loci. This is accomplished by combining the use of a restriction enzyme followed by bisulfite conversion. Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS) increases the biologically relevant genomic loci covered and has been used to profile cytosine methylation in DNA from human, mouse and other organisms. ERRBS initiates with restriction enzyme digestion of DNA to generate low molecular weight fragments for use in library preparation. These fragments are subjected to standard library construction for next generation sequencing. Bisulfite conversion of unmethylated cytosines prior to the final amplification step allows for quantitative base resolution of cytosine methylation levels in covered genomic loci. The protocol can be completed within four days. Despite low complexity in the first three bases sequenced, ERRBS libraries yield high quality data when using a designated sequencing control lane. Mapping and bioinformatics analysis is then performed and yields data that can be easily integrated with a variety of genome-wide platforms. ERRBS can utilize small input material quantities making it feasible to process human clinical samples and applicable in a range of research applications.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ongoing community-based clinical pathological cohort studies of aging and dementia (the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project) among 740 autopsied participants 66.0 to 108.3 years old. EXPOSURES: DNA methylation levels at individual CpG sites generated from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue using a bead assay.

These rhythms are paralleled by 24-hour rhythms of large portions of the transcriptome. The role of dynamic DNA methylation in influencing these rhythms is uncertain. While recent work in Neurospora suggests that dynamic site-specific circadian rhythms of DNA methylation may play a role in modulating the fungal molecular clock, such rhythms and their relationship to RNA expression have not, to our knowledge, been elucidated in mammalian tissues, including human brain tissues. We hypothesized that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation exist in the human brain, and play a role in driving 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 738 subjects. We assessed for 24-hour rhythmicity of 420,132 DNA methylation sites throughout the genome by considering methylation levels as a function of clock time of death and parameterizing these data using cosine functions. We determined global statistical significance by permutation. We then related rhythms of DNA methylation with rhythms of RNA expression determined by RNA sequencing. We found evidence of significant 24-hour rhythmicity of DNA methylation. Regions near transcription start sites were enriched for high-amplitude rhythmic DNA methylation sites, which were in turn time locked to 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression of nearby genes, with the nadir of methylation preceding peak transcript expression by 1-3 hours. Weak ante-mortem rest-activity rhythms were associated with lower amplitude DNA methylation rhythms as were older age and the presence of Alzheimer's disease. These findings support the hypothesis that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation, particularly near transcription start sites, may play a role in driving 24-hour rhythms of gene expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and may be affected by age and Alzheimer's disease.",7.528,1536

Via poorly characterized mechanisms, intermediate monocyte counts rise in chronic inflammatory diseases, among which chronic kidney disease is of particular epidemiologic importance. DNA methylation is a central epigenetic feature that controls hematopoiesis. By applying next-generation Methyl-Sequencing we now tested how far the 3 monocyte subsets differ in their DNA methylome and whether uremia induces DNA methylation changes in differentiating monocytes. We found that each monocyte subset displays a unique phenotype with regards to DNA methylation. Genes with differentially methylated promoter regions in intermediate monocytes were linked to distinct immunological processes, which is in line with results from recent gene expression analyses. In vitro, uremia induced dysregulation of DNA methylation in differentiating monocytes, which affected several transcription regulators important for monocyte differentiation (e.g., FLT3, HDAC1, MNT) and led to enhanced generation of intermediate monocytes. As potential mediator, the uremic toxin and methylation inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine induced shifts in monocyte subsets in vitro, and associated with monocyte subset counts in vivo. Our data support the concept of monocyte trichotomy and the distinct role of intermediate monocytes in human immunity. The shift in monocyte subsets that occurs in chronic kidney disease, a proinflammatory condition of substantial epidemiological impact, may be induced by accumulation of uremic toxins that mediate epigenetic dysregulation.",4.78,1367

H3K4me3 is a canonical chromatin mark of active transcription. Recent studies have suggested that H3K4me3 breadth has an important regulatory role in cell identity. This project examined H3K4me3 breadth at transcription start sites (TSS) in primary monocytes and its association with differential gene transcription in SLE. RESULTS: Integrative analysis was applied to chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from primary monocytes as well as genomic data available in public repositories. Four distinctive H3K4me3 patterns of ChIP-seq peaks were identified at 8399 TSSs. Narrow peaks were highly enriched with genes related to housekeeping functions. The broader peaks with extended H3K4me3 immediately upstream and/or downstream of TSS were associated with immune response genes. Many TSSs had downstream H3K4me3 extended to ~650 bp, where the transition of H3K4me3 to H3K36me3, a transcriptional elongation mark, is often found. The H3K4me3 pattern was strongly associated with transcription in SLE. Genes with narrow peaks were less likely (OR = 0.14, p = 2 x 10(-4)) while genes with extended downstream H3K4me3 were more likely (OR = 2.37, p = 1 x 10(-11)) to be overexpressed in SLE. Of the genes significantly overexpressed in SLE, 78.8 % had increased downstream H3K4me3 while only 47.1 % had increased upstream H3K4me3. Gene transcription sensitively and consistently responded to H3K4me3 change downstream of TSSs. Every 1 % increase of H3K4me3 in this region leads to ~1.5 % average increase of transcription.

We recently described an increased frequency of BCL2/ JH translocation with aging. It is known that methylation levels change with aging. The present study aimed to determine whether methylation alterations at CpG sites of BCL2 MBR were the cause of increased breakages with aging. We analyzed the methylation levels of three CpG sites on the region by pyrosequencing and studied if methylation levels and/or polymorphisms affecting CpG sites were associated with an increase of translocations. We observed that although the methylation levels of MBR CpG sites were higher in individuals with BCL2/JH translocation, in contrast to our expectations, these levels decreased with the age. Moreover, we show that polymorphisms at those CpG sites leading to absence of methylation seem to be a protective factor for the apparition of translocations.",0,294

Many of the effects of PNMS on offspring outcomes likely reflect the effects of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, to the fetal genome. However, no animal or human research can determine the extent to which the effects of PNMS on DNA methylation in human offspring is the result of the objective severity of the stressor to the pregnant mother, or her negative appraisal of the stressor or her resulting degree of negative stress. We examined the genome-wide DNA methylation profile in T cells from 34 adolescents whose mothers had rated the 1998 Quebec ice storm's consequences as positive or negative (that is, cognitive appraisal). The methylation levels of 2872 CGs differed significantly between adolescents in the positive and negative maternal cognitive appraisal groups. These CGs are affiliated with 1564 different genes and with 408 different biological pathways, which are prominently featured in immune function. Importantly, there was a significant overlap in the differentially methylated CGs or genes and biological pathways that are associated with cognitive appraisal and those associated with objective PNMS as we reported previously. Our study suggests that pregnant women's cognitive appraisals of an independent stressor may have widespread effects on DNA methylation across the entire genome of their unborn children, detectable during adolescence. Therefore, cognitive appraisals could be an important predictor variable to explore in PNMS research.",5.62,1980

However, most patients do not receive a diagnosis of OSCC until the late stages, which have a lower survival rate. The use of molecular marker analysis to identify early-stage OSCC would permit optimal timing for treatments and consequently prolong survival. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers of OSCC using the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel, which comprised a total of 1,505 CpG sites covering 807 genes. Samples of buccal mucosa resected from 40 OSCC patients and normal tissue samples obtained from 15 patients (normal mucosa from OSCC patients or from patients undergoing surgery unrelated to OSCC) were analyzed. Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) methylation exhibited a perfect specificity for detecting OSCC, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 for both all-stage and early-stage OSCC. Methylation of 7 genes (ASCL1, FGF3, FLT4, GAS7, KDR, TERT, and TFPI2) constitutes the top-20 panels for detecting OSCC. The top-20 panels for detecting early-stage OSCC contain 8 genes: ADCYAP1, EPHA7, FLT4, GSTM2, KDR, MT1A, NPY, and TFPI2. FLT4 RNA expression and methylation level were validated using RT-PCR and a pyrosequencing methylation assay. The median level of FLT4 expression was 2.14-fold for normal relative to OSCC tissue samples (P < 0.0001). Among the 8 pyrosequenced FLT4 CpG sites, methylation level was much higher in the OSCC samples. In conclusion, methylation statuses of selected genes, and especially FLT4, KDR, and TFPI2, might be of great potential as biomarkers for early detection of buccal OSCC.",4.78,785

We performed targeted DNA methylation analysis of 1.505 CpG loci in 807 cancer-related genes in a cohort of 76 GISTs, combined with genome-wide mRNA expression analysis in 22 GISTs, to identify signatures associated with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. Principal component analysis revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns associated with anatomical localization, genotype, mitotic counts and clinical follow-up. Methylation of a single CpG dinucleotide in the non-CpG island promoter of SPP1 was significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival. Hypomethylation of this CpG was an independent prognostic parameter in a multivariate analysis compared to anatomical localization, genotype, tumor size and mitotic counts in a cohort of 141 GISTs with clinical follow-up. The epigenetic regulation of SPP1 was confirmed in vitro, and the functional impact of SPP1 protein on tumorigenesis-related signaling pathways was demonstrated. In summary, SPP1 promoter methylation is a novel and independent prognostic parameter in GISTs, and might be helpful in estimating the aggressiveness of GISTs from the intermediate-risk category.",5.085,890

This study aims to explore the influence of MDR1 methylation on curative effect of interventional embolism chemotherapy for cervical cancer. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with cervical cancer receiving embolism chemotherapy were selected, and 45 normal cervical tissues were included as a control. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in cervical cancer, and to make an analysis compared with normal tissues. The methylation status of the MDR1 gene promoter region 16 CpG units was analyzed by using kilobase-specific cracking and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The results indicated that the positive expression rates of P-gp were 0% (0/45) in normal cervical tissue, and 61.19% (41/67) and 77.61% (52/67) before and after interventional embolism chemotherapy in cervical cancer tissues, respectively. There were significant differences compared with normal cervical tissues (chi (2)=4.2523, 0.0392). The positive expression rate of P-gp before chemotherapy was negatively correlated with efficacy of chemotherapy (r=-0.340, P=0.005). Methylation rate of 13 CpG units in normal tissues was significantly greater than cervical tissues (P<0.05). In cervical cancer tissue, methylation rate of six CpG units before interventional embolism chemotherapy was higher than after chemotherapy, but that of one CpG unit was lower than after chemotherapy (P<0.05). The methylation rate of one CpG unit with effective chemotherapy before chemotherapy was significantly higher than ineffective chemotherapy (P<0.05), and the other CpG units were similar (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: P-gp expression level coded by MDR1, methylation status of partial MDR1 gene promoter regions CpG island, is closely related to the efficacy of interventional embolism chemotherapy for cervical cancer before the operation.",1.469,1789

It is characterized by HM with excessive trophoblastic proliferation, which mimics the appearance of androgenetic molar conceptuses despite their diploid biparental constitution. It has been proposed that the phenotypes of both types of mole are associated with aberrant genomic imprinting. However no systematic analyses for imprinting defects have been reported. Here, we present the genome-wide methylation profiles of both spontaneous androgenetic and biparental NLRP7 defective molar tissues. We observe total paternalization of all ubiquitous and placenta-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in four androgenetic moles; namely gain of methylation at paternally methylated loci and absence of methylation at maternally methylated regions. The methylation defects observed in five RHM biopsies from NLRP7 defective patients are restricted to lack-of-methylation at maternal DMRs. Surprisingly RHMs from two sisters with the same missense mutations, as well as consecutive RHMs from one affected female show subtle allelic methylation differences, suggesting inter-RHM variation. These epigenotypes are consistent with NLRP7 being a maternal-effect gene and involved in imprint acquisition in the oocyte. In addition, bioinformatic screening of the resulting methylation datasets identified over sixty loci with methylation profiles consistent with imprinting in the placenta, of which we confirm 22 as novel maternally methylated loci. These observations strongly suggest that the molar phenotypes are due to defective placenta-specific imprinting and over-expression of paternally expressed transcripts, highlighting that maternal-effect mutations of NLRP7 are associated with the most severe form of multi-locus imprinting defects in humans.",7.528,232

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 281 Japanese cancer screenees aged 40-69 years with no history of H.pylori eradication therapy who responded to a validated food frequency questionnaire. DNA methylation levels of marker genes (miR-124a-3, EMX1 and NKX6-1) in gastric mucosa were quantified by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. A multivariate beta regression model was used to investigate the association of pack-years of smoking and intakes of green/yellow vegetables, fruit and salt with methylation levels of marker genes. All analyses were stratified by H.pylori status. We found 2.5 to 34.1 times higher mean methylation levels among those with current H.pylori infection (n = 117) compared to those without (n = 164). After adjustment for potential confounders, we found increased levels of miR-124a-3 methylation according to pack-years of smoking and decreased levels of methylation according to green/yellow vegetable intake. We did not detect these associations among those without H.pylori infection. In conclusion, smoking habits and green/yellow vegetable intake were associated with DNA methylation levels in gastric mucosae of healthy individuals with current H.pylori infection.

Here, we report that CRL4B is associated with histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A). We showed that CRL4B, through catalyzing H2AK119 monoubiquitination, facilitates H3K9 tri-methylation and DNA methylation, two key epigenetic modifications involved in DNA methylation-based gene silencing. Depletion of CUL4B resulted in loss of not only H2AK119 monoubiquitination but also H3K9 trimethylation and DNA methylation, leading to derepression of a collection of genes, including the tumor suppressor IGFBP3. We demonstrated that CUL4B promotes cell proliferation and invasion, which are consistent with a tumorigenic phenotype, at least partially by repressing IGFBP3. We found that the expression of CUL4B is markedly upregulated in samples of human cervical carcinoma and is negatively correlated with the expression of IGFBP3. Our experiments unveiled a coordinated action between histone ubiquitination/methylation and DNA methylation in transcription repression, providing a mechanism for CUL4B in tumorigenesis.",8.459,1604

Most studies investigating the mechanisms underlying adipogenesis focus on highly regulated transcriptional pathways; little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms in this process. Here, we determined the role of DNA methylation in regulating 3T3-L1 adipogenesis in early and late stage of differentiation. We found that inhibiting DNA methylation pharmacologically by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) at early stage of 3T3-L1 differentiation markedly suppressed adipogenesis. This inhibition of adipogenesis by 5-aza-dC was associated with up-regulation of Wnt10a, an antiadipogenic factor, and down-regulation of Wnt10a promoter methylation. In contrast, inhibiting DNA methylation by 5-aza-dC at late stage of differentiation enhanced the lipogenic program. The differential effects of 5-aza-dC on adipogenesis were confirmed by gain or loss of function of DNA methyltransferase 1 using genetic approaches. We further explored the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced lipogenesis by inhibition of DNA methylation at late stage of differentiation. The Srebp1c promoter is enriched with CpG sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that DNA methyltransferase 1 bound to the methylation region at the Srebp1c promoter. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the DNA methylation at the key cis-elements of the Srebp1c promoter was down-regulated in adipogenesis. Further, luciferase reporter assays showed that the Srebp1c promoter activity was dramatically up-regulated by the unmethylated promoter compared with the fully methylated promoter. Thus DNA methylation appears to exert a biphasic regulatory role in adipogenesis, promoting differentiation at early stage while inhibiting lipogenesis at late stage of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation.",4.022,1006

However, simple functional studies of genes adjacent to aberrant methylation sites cannot well reflect the regulatory relationship between DNA methylation and gene transcription during the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced liver cancer, whereas a further analysis of the cis-regulatory elements and their trans-acting factors adjacent to DNA methylation can more precisely reflect the relationship between them. MYC and MAX (MYC associated factor X) were found to participating cell cycle through a bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, it was found that the hypomethylation of cis-regulatory sites in the MYC promoter region and the hypermethylation of cis-regulatory sites in the MAX promoter region result in the up-regulation of MYC mRNA expression and the down-regulation of MAX mRNA, which increased the hepatocyte carcinogenesis tendency.",6.359,238

The aim of this study was to investigate promoter methylation and gene expression of selected TSGs in HCC to identify candidate genes for further validation as potential biomarkers. METHODS: Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method was used to measure the methylation status of 25 TSGs in 49 HCC samples and 36 corresponding non-cancerous liver tissue samples. Relative expression of the differentially methylated genes was assessed at the mRNA level using quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We observed a significantly higher methylation in genes WT1, PAX5, PAX6, PYCARD and GATA5 in HCC compared with control samples. The expression of PAX5 was significantly decreased by methylation; conversely methylation of WT1 was associated with higher mRNA levels. Methylation of GATA5 was significantly associated with overall survival and methylation of WT1 and PAX5 significantly varied between patients with ALBI score 1 vs. 2+3. Moreover, PAX5 was significantly more methylated in patients with tumour grade 2+3 vs. grade 1, and methylation of the PAX5 correlated with the patient's age at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: HCC evince aberrant promoter methylation of WT1, PAX5, PAX6, PYCARD and GATA5 genes. Correlation between GATA5, WT1 and PAX5 methylation and clinical/histological parameters is suggestive of applicability of these markers in non-invasive (epi)genetic testing in HCC.",2.707,1122

Methylation of the p16(INK4a) gene occurs early in the development of cervical cancer. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) are prevalent, and their behavior is variable. OBJECTIVE: To identify the HPV DNA type, detect the methylation status of the p16(INK4A) gene, and analyze their association with the cytological evolution of LSIL over a period of two years. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with 40 participants. Cervical scrapings were collected for cytological and molecular analysis. HPV DNA detection and typing were performed by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Methylation-specific PCR was performed to detect methylation. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 87% of the cases, and type 16 was the most frequent type. Methylation was detected in 11% of the cases and did not exhibit a significant correlation with the HPV type. Unfavorable cytological evolution exhibited a significant association with the presence of methylation. CONCLUSION: HPV 16 was the most frequently detected type of HPV in LSIL. Methylation of the p16(INK4A) gene was infrequent and occurred independent of the presence of HPV DNA. Methylation of the p16(INK4a) gene exhibited a significant correlation with persistence/progression of LSIL.",2.706,488

Thus, we identified DNA methylation alterations on the genome scale during lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) progression to understand the carcinogenic process and identify clinically relevant biomarkers. We found that epigenetic alterations in LADC mainly occur during the early stage of LADC progression, and there are no significant methylation differences between early-stage and late-stage LADCs. This suggests that DNA methylation alterations characterize a turning point of early events in LADC progression. By comparing DNA methylation between early-stage LADCs and normal lung tissues, we further identified 940 genes with significant alterations in DNA methylation. Sixty-seven genes were found to exhibit strong correlation between methylation alterations and expression changes, based on associated gene expression data. According to gene ontology analysis, these genes are involved in lung development, respiratory system development, cell cycle, histidine metabolism, the Wnt signaling pathway, and the p53 signaling pathway. We also found that genes on chromosome 18 most frequently showed promoter hypermethylation. Moreover, we found that LADC-associated DNA hypomethylation occurred preferentially at neither histone H3 lysine 4 nor histone H3 lysine 27 mark domains in human embryonic stem cells (NMDs) and that hypomethylation of NMDs was associated with a poor prognostic signature in LADC. Our findings have important implications for LADC progression because of the identification of novel epigenetic biomarkers potentially involved in early-stage LADC and for establishing the importance of NMD DNA hypomethylation for predicting prognosis in LADC.",0.775,610

Developmental mode describes larval phenotypes, including morphology, ecology and behavior of larvae, which typically are generalized across different species. The polychaete worm Pygospio elegans is one of few species polymorphic in developmental mode, with multiple larval phenotypes, providing a possibility to examine the potential mechanisms allowing transitions in developmental mode. We investigated the presence of DNA methylation in P. elegans, and, since maternal provisioning is a key factor determining eventual larval phenotype, we compared patterns of DNA methylation in females during oogenesis in this species. We demonstrate that intragenic CpG site DNA methylation and many relevant genes necessary for DNA methylation occur in P. elegans. Methylation-sensitive AFLP analysis showed that gravid females with offspring differing in larval developmental mode have significantly different methylation profiles and that the females with benthic larvae and non-reproductive females from the same location also differ in their epigenetic profiles. Analysis of CpG sites in transcriptome data supported our findings of DNA methylation in this species and showed that CpG observed/expected ratios differ among females gravid with embryos destined to different developmental modes. The differences in CpG site DNA methylation patterns seen among the samples suggest a potential for epigenetic regulation of gene expression (through DNA methylation) in this species.",3.234,143

We focused on DNMT1 and DNMT3B, DNA methyltransferases responsible for (de novo) methylation, and EZH2, histone (H3K27) methyltransferase, and examined their roles in tumor suppressor gene (TSG) methylation patterns we have previously established in sporadic and familial cancers. Our investigation comprised 165 tumors, stratified by tissue of origin (117 colorectal and 48 endometrial carcinomas) and sporadic vs. familial disease (57 sporadic vs. 60 familial, mainly Lynch syndrome, colorectal carcinomas). By immunohistochemical evaluation, EZH2 protein expression was associated with a TSG methylator phenotype. DNMT1, DNMT3B, and EZH2 were expressed at significantly higher levels in tumor vs. normal tissues. DNMT1 and EZH2 expression were positively correlated and higher in microsatellite-unstable vs. microsatellite-stable tumors, whether sporadic or hereditary. Ki-67 expression mirrored the same pattern. Promoter methylation of the methyltransferase genes themselves was addressed as a possible cause behind their altered expression. While DNMT1 or EZH2 did not show differential methylation between normal and tumor tissues, DNMT3B analysis corroborated the regulatory role of a distal promoter region. Our study shows that methyltransferase expression in cancer depends on the tissue of origin, microsatellite-instability status, cellular proliferation, and--in the case of DNMT3B--promoter methylation of the respective gene. Translation of methyltransferase expression into DNA methylation appears complex as suggested by the fact that except for EZH2, no clear association between methyltransferase protein expression and TSG methylation was observed.",4.041,190

The increase in methylation at the promoter region of a tumour suppressor gene can lead to gene inactivation, selecting cells with proliferative advantage. Thus, promoter hypermethylation is considered a marker in a variety of malignant tumours, including oral cavity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The methylation pattern of eight genes was evaluated in 40 oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and 40 saliva samples from healthy individuals by Q-MSP. Different combinations of genes were also assessed in order to identify gene panels that could better distinguish between OSCC and saliva samples. RESULTS: CCNA1, DAPK, DCC and TIMP3 methylation were highly specific for being found in the OSCC samples. Moreover, the combination of these genes improved detection when compared with single markers, reaching values of 92.5% for sensitivity and specificity (when using the panel CCNA1, DCC, TIMP3). Moreover, DAPK, DCC and TIMP3 were hypermethylated in nearly 90% of clinically T1 and T2 cases. CONCLUSION: The pursuing of this panel of hypermethylated genes is an important tool for the detection of individuals with OSCC. Moreover, the identification of these markers in early stages of OSCC shows the feasibility of using the panel on saliva as possible biomarkers for early diagnosis. The lack of association between the methylation status of these genes and clinical characteristics shows that they are able to distinguish OSCC cases irrespective of social and clinical factors (gender, age, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, clinical stage, vascular embolisation and perineural invasion).",2.649,1428

Now it is a challenge to identify patients at higher risk for relapse and progression after surgery, and more novel prognostic biomarkers are needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of protocadherin17 (PCDH17) methylation in serum and its predictive value for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated the methylation status of PCDH17 in serum samples of 167 early-stage prostate cancer patients and 44 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and then evaluated the relationship between PCDH17 methylation and clinicopathologic features. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox analysis were used to evaluate its predictive value for BCR. RESULTS The ratio of PCDH17 methylation in prostate cancer patients was higher than in patients with BPH. Moreover, PCDH17 methylation was significantly associated with advanced pathological stage, higher Gleason score, higher preoperative PSA levels, and BCR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with methylated PCDH17 had shorter BCR-free survival time compared to patients with unmethylated PCDH17.

25517766,"Sex differences in the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern and impact on gene expression, microRNA levels and insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets.",[],Genome biology,2014,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic factors regulate tissue-specific expression and X-chromosome inactivation. Previous studies have identified epigenetic differences between sexes in some human tissues. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic modifications contribute to sex-specific differences in insulin secretion and metabolism. Here, we investigate the impact of sex on the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in human pancreatic islets from 53 males and 34 females, and relate the methylome to changes in expression and insulin secretion. RESULTS: Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is higher in female versus male islets. Genome-wide DNA methylation data in human islets clusters based on sex. While the chromosome-wide DNA methylation level on the X-chromosome is higher in female versus male islets, the autosomes do not display a global methylation difference between sexes. Methylation of 8,140 individual X-chromosome sites and 470 autosomal sites shows sex-specific differences in human islets. These include sites in/near AR, DUSP9, HNF4A, BCL11A and CDKN2B. 61 X-chromosome genes and 18 autosomal genes display sex-specific differences in both DNA methylation and expression. These include NKAP, SPESP1 and APLN, which exhibited lower expression in females. Functional analyses demonstrate that methylation of NKAP and SPESP1 promoters in vitro suppresses their transcriptional activity. Silencing of Nkap or Apln in clonal beta-cells results in increased insulin secretion. Differential methylation between sexes is associated with altered levels of microRNAs miR-660 and miR-532 and related target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome-wide and gene-specific sex differences in DNA methylation associate with altered expression and insulin secretion in human islets. Our data demonstrate that epigenetics contribute to sex-specific metabolic phenotypes.",10.81,1404

Cancer,2015,"Several protein lysine methyltransferases and demethylases have been identified to have critical roles in histone modification. A large body of evidence has indicated that their dysregulation is involved in the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer, and these enzymes are now considered to be potential therapeutic targets. Although most studies have focused on histone methylation, many reports have revealed that these enzymes also regulate the methylation dynamics of non-histone proteins such as p53, RB1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), which have important roles in human tumorigenesis. In this Review, we summarize the molecular functions of protein lysine methylation and its involvement in human cancer, with a particular focus on lysine methylation of non-histone proteins.",37.4,623

Williams syndrome (WS) and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome (Dup7) are rare neurodevelopmental disorders with broad phenotypic spectra caused by deletion and duplication, respectively, of a 1.5-Mb region that includes several genes with a role in epigenetic regulation. We have identified striking differences in DNA methylation across the genome between blood cells from children with WS or Dup7 and blood cells from typically developing (TD) children. Notably, regions that were differentially methylated in both WS and Dup7 displayed a significant and symmetrical gene-dose-dependent effect, such that WS typically showed increased and Dup7 showed decreased DNA methylation. Differentially methylated genes were significantly enriched with genes in pathways involved in neurodevelopment, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) candidate genes, and imprinted genes. Using alignment with ENCODE data, we also found the differentially methylated regions to be enriched with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites. These findings suggest that gene(s) within 7q11.23 alter DNA methylation at specific sites across the genome and result in dose-dependent DNA-methylation profiles in WS and Dup7. Given the extent of DNA-methylation changes and the potential impact on CTCF binding and chromatin regulation, epigenetic mechanisms most likely contribute to the complex neurological phenotypes of WS and Dup7. Our findings highlight the importance of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of WS and Dup7 and provide molecular mechanisms that are potentially shared by WS, Dup7, and ASD.",10.931,595

As mutations are rare but methylation is common in pituitary adenomas (PA), we determined promoter methylation and its clinical impact in 85 primary and 15 recurrent PA by methylation-specific PCR. 40 females (47%) and 45 males (53%) with a median age of 53 years harboring micro-, macro-, and giant adenomas in 12, 82, and 6% were included (prolactinomas, corticotroph, somatotroph, gonadotroph, thyreotroph, plurihormonal, and null cell adenomas in 11, 18, 10, 29, 1, 10, and 21%, respectively). In primary diagnosed tumors, methylation rate was 27% and higher in males than in females (40 vs. 13%, p = 0.001) after uni- and multivariate analyses. Methylation differed among PA subtypes (0-42%, p = n.s.) and was not significantly correlated with tumor size, cavernous sinus invasion, or serum hormone levels. Ki67 labeling index and recurrence (N = 16, 19%) were independent of methylation. In recurrent tumors, methylation was similar to primary PA (N = 5/15, 33%) and remained unchanged along follow-up. Thus, while being commonly observed in PA, hTERT promoter methylation is stable along follow-up and independent of most clinical variables, PA subtype, proliferation, and without prognostic value.",1.224,1270

Sex-specific DNA methylation patterns at specific CpG islands controlling imprinted genes are acquired during this window of development. Characterization of the DNA methylation dynamics of imprinted genes acquired by oocytes during folliculogenesis is essential for understanding the physiological and genetic aspects of female gametogenesis and to determine the parameters for oocyte competence. This knowledge can be used to improve in vitro embryo production (IVP), specifically because oocyte competence is one of the most important aspects determining the success of IVP. Imprinted genes, such as IGF2, play important roles in embryo development, placentation and fetal growth. The aim of this study was to characterize the DNA methylation profile of the CpG island located in IGF2 exon 10 in oocytes during bovine folliculogenesis. The methylation percentages in oocytes from primordial follicles, final secondary follicles, small antral follicles, large antral follicles, MII oocytes and spermatozoa were 73.74 +/- 2.88%, 58.70 +/- 7.46%, 56.00 +/- 5.58%, 65.77 +/- 5.10%, 56.35 +/- 7.45% and 96.04 +/- 0.78%, respectively. Oocytes from primordial follicles showed fewer hypomethylated alleles (15.5%) than MII oocytes (34.6%) (p = 0.039); spermatozoa showed only hypermethylated alleles. Moreover, MII oocytes were less methylated than spermatozoa (p<0.001). Our results showed that the methylation pattern of this region behaves differently between mature oocytes and spermatozoa. However, while this region has a classical imprinted pattern in spermatozoa that is fully methylated, it was variable in mature oocytes, showing hypermethylated and hypomethylated alleles. Furthermore, our results suggest that this CpG island may have received precocious reprogramming, considering that the hypermethylated pattern was already found in growing oocytes from primordial follicles. These results may contribute to our understanding of the reprogramming of imprinted genes during bovine oogenesis.",3.234,1645

Using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 assay, we derived genome-wide measures of blood DNA methylation and assessed them for their prospective association with UCC risk. METHODS: We used 439 case-control pairs from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study matched on age, sex, country of birth, DNA sample type, and collection period. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) of UCC risk per s.d. of each genome-wide measure of DNA methylation and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders. We also investigated associations by disease subtype, sex, smoking, and time since blood collection. RESULTS: The risk of superficial UCC was decreased for individuals with higher levels of our genome-wide DNA methylation measure (OR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.94; P=0.02). This association was particularly strong for current smokers at sample collection (OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.83). Intermediate levels of our genome-wide measure were associated with decreased risk of invasive UCC. Some variation was observed between UCC subtypes and the location and regulatory function of the CpGs included in the genome-wide measures of methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of our genome-wide DNA methylation measure were associated with decreased risk of superficial UCC and intermediate levels were associated with reduced risk of invasive disease.

The methylation of these gene promoters was associated with oxidative stress that induced liver damage. This study aims to explore the relationship among GSTP1 and GSTM3 methylation, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) expression, and oxidative stress in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We retrospectively enrolled 153 patients with CHB and 40 healthy controls (HCs). The GSTP1 and GSTM3 methylation status, DNMTs mRNA levels in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and TNF-alpha and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in plasma were detected. GSTP1 methylation was significantly higher in patients with CHB than HCs (P = 0.047). Patients with HBeAg-positive CHB showed significantly higher GSTP1 methylation than those with HBeAg-negative CHB (P = 0.017) and HCs (P = 0.007). No significant difference was observed between GSTP1 methylation in HBeAg-negative CHB and HCs (P = 0.191). DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA levels were significantly higher in participants with GSTP1 methylation than those without. In patients with CHB, the degree of GSTP1 promoter methylation was significantly correlated with DNMT1 mRNA, DNMT3a mRNA, TNF-alpha, MDA, HBeAg, ALT, AST and TBIL. In contrast, no significant difference was found between GSTM3 methylation in patients with CHB and HCs (P = 0.079). Meanwhile, no significant difference could be observed between GSTM3 promoter methylation in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB and HBeAg-negative CHB (P = 0.146). Therefore, this study demonstrated that GSTP1 hypermethylation was associated with DNMT1, DNMT3a overexpression and oxidative stress in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB.",0,1746

In this study, we aimed to characterize such a picture in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). Base substitutions of 55 cancer-related genes and copy number alterations (CNAs) of 28 cancer-related genes were analyzed by targeted sequencing. Forty-four of 57 ESCCs (77%) had 64 non-synonymous somatic mutations, and 24 ESCCs (42%) had 35 CNAs. A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array showed that the CpG island methylator phenotype was unlikely to be present in ESCCs, a different situation from gastric and colon cancers. Regarding individual pathways affected in ESCCs, the WNT pathway was activated potentially by aberrant methylation of its negative regulators, such as SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, SFRP5, SOX17, and WIF1 (33%). The p53 pathway was inactivated by TP53 mutations (70%), and potentially by aberrant methylation of its downstream genes. The cell cycle was deregulated by mutations of CDKN2A (9%), deletions of CDKN2A and RB1 (32%), and by aberrant methylation of CDKN2A and CHFR (9%). In conclusion, ESCCs had unique methylation profiles different from gastric and colon cancers. The genes involved in the WNT pathway were affected mainly by epigenetic alterations, and those involved in the p53 pathway and cell cycle regulation were affected mainly by genetic alterations.

These enzymes must coexist with several endogenous methyltransferases that are essential for fine-tuning of the decoding center, such as RsmH and RsmI in Escherichia coli, which methylate C1402 and RsmF C1407. The resistance methyltransferases have a contrasting distribution--ArmA has spread worldwide, whereas a single clinical isolate producing NpmA has been reported. The rate of dissemination of resistance depends on the fitness cost associated with its expression. We have compared ArmA and NpmA in isogenic Escherichia coli harboring the corresponding structural genes and their inactive point mutants cloned under the control of their native constitutive promoter in the stable plasmid pGB2. Growth rate determination and competition experiments showed that ArmA had a fitness cost due to methylation of G1405, whereas NpmA conferred only a slight disadvantage to the host due to production of the enzyme. MALDI MS indicated that ArmA impeded one of the methylations at C1402 by RsmI, and not at C1407 as previously proposed, whereas NpmA blocked the activity of RsmF at C1407. A dual luciferase assay showed that methylation at G1405 and A1408 and lack of methylation at C1407 affect translation accuracy. These results indicate that resistance methyltransferases impair endogenous methylation with different consequences on cell fitness.",0,1624

Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in specific tissues.

PARP3 plays an important role in DNA damage repair and mitotic progression. In this study, we identified, using mass spectrometric techniques, two novel post-translational modification sites in PARP3, alpha-N-methylation and phosphorylation of serine 461 (S461). We found that the N-terminal alpha-amino group of PARP3 is heavily methylated in human cells, and N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT) is a key enzyme required for this methylation. We also observed that the phosphorylation level of S461 in PARP3 could be reduced in human cells upon treatment with flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Moreover, we demonstrated that S461 phosphorylation, but not alpha-N-methylation of PARP3, may be involved in the cellular response toward DNA double-strand breaks. These findings provide novel insights into the post-translational regulation of PARP3.",4.245,186

However, methods for triaging functional candidate genes as useful biomarkers for epidemiological study have not yet been developed. METHODS: We conducted targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) to investigate associations of DNA methylation and mRNA expression in HCC. Integrative analyses of epigenetic profiles with DNA copy number analysis were used to pinpoint functional genes regulated mainly by altered DNA methylation. RESULTS: Significant differences between HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue were observed for 28 bis-seq amplicons, with methylation differences varying from 12% to 43%. Available mRNA expression data in Oncomine were evaluated. Two candidate genes (GRASP and TSPYL5) were significantly under-expressed in HCC tumors in comparison with precursor and normal liver tissues. The expression levels in tumor tissues were, respectively, 1.828 and - 0.148, significantly lower than those in both precursor and normal liver tissue. Validations in an additional 42 paired tissues showed consistent under-expression in tumor tissue for GRASP (-7.49) and TSPYL5 (-9.71). A highly consistent DNA hypermethylation and mRNA repression pattern was obtained for both GRASP (69%) and TSPYL5 (73%), suggesting that their biological function is regulated by DNA methylation. Another two genes (RGS17 and NR2E1) at Chr6q showed significantly decreased DNA methylation in tumors with loss of DNA copy number compared to those without, suggesting alternative roles of DNA copy number losses and hypermethylation in the regulation of RGS17 and NR2E1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that integrative analyses of epigenomic and genomic data provide an efficient way to filter functional biomarkers for future epidemiological studies in human cancers.",2.873,846

 College of Medical Genetics",2014,"PURPOSE: Expression of imprinted genes is regulated by DNA methylation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an imprinting disorder caused by epimutations of DMRs at 11p15.5. To date, multiple methylation defects have been reported in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients with epimutations; however, limited numbers of DMRs have been analyzed. The susceptibility of DMRs to aberrant methylation, alteration of gene expression due to aberrant methylation, and causative factors for multiple methylation defects remain undetermined. METHODS: Comprehensive methylation analysis with two quantitative methods, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and bisulfite pyrosequencing, was conducted across 29 DMRs in 54 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients with epimutations. Allelic expressions of three genes with aberrant methylation were analyzed. All DMRs with aberrant methylation were sequenced. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of KvDMR1-loss of methylation patients and 30% of H19DMR-gain of methylation patients showed multiple methylation defects. Maternally methylated DMRs were susceptible to aberrant hypomethylation in KvDMR1-loss of methylation patients. Biallelic expression of the genes was associated with aberrant methylation. Cis-acting pathological variations were not found in any aberrantly methylated DMR. CONCLUSION: Maternally methylated DMRs may be vulnerable to DNA demethylation during the preimplantation stage, when hypomethylation of KvDMR1 occurs, and aberrant methylation of DMRs affects imprinted gene expression. Cis-acting variations of the DMRs are not involved in the multiple methylation defects.",7.329,1414

Meanwhile, a normal control group (C57BL/6J mice fed with normal diet, N-control) and a model control group (ApoE(-/-) mice fed with normal diet, A-control) were set. The degree of atherosclerosis was observed by HE and oil red O staining. Automatic biochemical analyzer was used to detect the serum levels of Hcy.

DNA methylation plays an important role in determining the biology of cancer but prognostic information is scanty. We assessed the potential of gene-specific DNA methylation changes to predict death from prostate cancer in a cohort of untreated men in the UK. METHODS: This was a population-based study in which cases were identified from six cancer registries in Great Britain. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded transurethral prostate resection tissues collected during 1990-96 from men with clinically-localised cancer who chose not to be treated for at least 6 months following diagnosis. The primary end point was death from prostate cancer. Outcomes were determined through medical records and cancer registry records. Pyrosequencing was used to quantify methylation in 13 candidate genes with established or suggested roles in cancer. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to identify possible predictors for prostate cancer-related death. RESULTS: Of 367 men, 99 died from prostate cancer during a median of 9.5 years follow-up (max = 20). Univariately, 12 genes were significantly associated with prostate cancer mortality, hazard ratios ranged between 1.09 and 1.28 per decile increase in methylation. Stepwise Cox regression modelling suggested that the methylation of genes HSPB1, CCND2 and DPYS contributed objective prognostic information to Gleason score and PSA with respect to cancer-related death during follow-up (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Methylation of 13 genes was analysed in 367 men with localised prostate cancer who were conservatively treated and stratified with respect to death from prostate cancer and those who survived or died of other causes. Of the 13 genes analysed, differential methylation of HSPB1, CCND2 and DPYS provided independent prognostic information. Assessment of gene-methylation may provide independent objective information that can be used to segregate prostate cancers at diagnosis into predicted behavioural groups.",3.362,1859

Recently, aKMT, a highly conserved crenarchaeal protein lysine methyltransferase, was identified and shown to exhibit broad substrate specificity in vitro. Here, we have constructed an aKMT deletion mutant (DeltaaKMT) of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. The mutant was viable but showed a moderately slower growth rate than the wild type strain under non-optimal growth conditions. Consistent with the moderate effect of the lack of aKMT on the growth of the cell, expression of a small number of genes, which encode putative functions in substrate transportation, energy metabolism, transcriptional regulation, stress response proteins, etc, was differentially regulated by more than 2 fold in the mutant strain, as compared to that in the wild type strain. Analysis of the methylation of total cellular protein by mass spectrometry revealed that methylated proteins accounted for ~2/3 (1,158/1,750) and ~1/3 (591/1,766) of the identified proteins in the wild type and the mutant strains, respectively, indicating that there is extensive protein methylation in S. islandicus and that aKMT is a major protein methyltransferase in this organism. No significant sequence or secondary structural preference was detected at the sites of methylation by aKMT. The crystal structure of aKMT in complex with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) or S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) reveals that the protein consists of four alpha helices and seven beta sheets, lacking a substrate recognition domain found in PrmA, a bacterial homolog of aKMT, in agreement with the broad substrate specificity of aKMT. Our results suggest that aKMT may serve a role in maintaining the methylation status of cellular proteins required for the efficient growth of the organism under certain non-optimal conditions.",14.018,1672

Previously we showed that LINE-1 hypomethylation in neuronal tissues is associated with pathogenesis of neural tube defect (NTD). Herein, we further evaluated LINE-1 Homo sapiens (L1Hs) methylation in tissues derived from three germ layers of stillborn NTD fetuses, to define patterns of tissue specific methylation and site-specific hypomethylation at CpG sites within an L1Hs promoter region. Stable, tissue-specific L1Hs methylation patterns throughout three germ layer lineages of the fetus, placenta, and maternal peripheral blood were observed. Samples from maternal peripheral blood exhibited the highest level of L1Hs methylation (64.95%) and that from placenta showed the lowest (26.82%). Between samples from NTDs and controls, decrease in L1Hs methylation was only significant in NTD-affected brain tissue at 7.35%, especially in females (8.98%). L1Hs hypomethylation in NTDs was also associated with a significant increase in expression level of an L1Hs-encoded transcript in females (r = -0.846, p = 0.004). This could be due to genomic DNA instability and alternation in chromatins accessibility resulted from abnormal L1Hs hypomethylation, as showed in this study with HCT-15 cells treated with methylation inhibitor 5-Aza.",3.621,1655

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by amyloid plaque deposition and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, we examined the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression of seven genes including CTSB, CTSD, DDT, TSC1, NRD1, UQCRC1 and NDUFA6 and its effect on the risk of AD in a Chinese population. Our finding showed significantly increased gene expression of these 7 genes in AD patients (2.7-fold-8.6-fold). UQCRC1 was highly methylated in AD patients and there was strong positive correlation between gene expression level and methylation status of UQCRC1 (p < 0.001). Further analysis showed the methylation status of UQCRC1 was significantly associated with gene expression of NRD1, DDT, CTSB and CTSD, suggested the regulatory mechanism on these 4 genes by UQCRC1.

Based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of monocyte DNA, we have investigated the methylation state of all CpG islands (CGIs) associated with a retrocopy (n = 1,319), their genomic environment, as well as the CGIs associated with the ancestral genes. Approximately 10% of retrocopies are associated with a CGI. Whereas almost all CGIs of the human genome are unmethylated, 68% of the CGIs associated with a retrocopy are methylated. In retrocopies resulting from multiple retrotranspositions of the same ancestral gene, the methylation state of the CGI often differs. There is a strong positive correlation between the methylation state of the CGI/retrocopy and their genomic environment, suggesting that the methylation state of the integration site determined the methylation state of the CGI/retrocopy, or that methylation of the retrocopy by a host defense mechanism has spread into the adjacent regions. Only a minor fraction of CGI/retrocopies (n = 195) has intermediate methylation levels. Among these, the previously reported CGI/retrocopy in intron 2 of the RB1 gene (PPP1R26P1) as well as the CGI associated with the retrocopy RPS2P32 identified in this study carry a maternal methylation imprint.

FXR expression is reduced in colorectal tumors of subjects carrying inactivated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this reduction may offer new molecular targets for colon cancer prevention. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how APC inactivation influences the regulation of FXR expression in colonic mucosal cells. We hypothesized that APC inactivation would epigenetically repress nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (FXR gene name) expression through increased CpG methylation. METHODS: Normal proximal colonic mucosa and normal-appearing adjacent colonic mucosa and colon tumors were collected from wild-type C57BL/6J and Apc-deficient (Apc(Min) (/+)) male mice, respectively. The expression of Fxr, ileal bile acid-binding protein (Ibabp), small heterodimer partner (Shp), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In both normal and adjacent colonic mucosa and colon tumors, we measured CpG methylation of Fxr in bisulfonated genomic DNA. In vitro, we measured the impact of APC inactivation and deoxycholic acid (DCA) treatment on FXR expression in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells transfected with silencing RNA for APC and HT-29 cells carrying inactivated APC. RESULTS: In Apc(Min) (/+) mice, constitutive CpG methylation of the Fxralpha3/4 promoter was linked to reduced (60-90%) baseline Fxr, Ibabp, and Shp and increased Cox-2 expression in apparently normal adjacent mucosa and colon tumors. Apc knockdown in HCT-116 cells increased cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) and lowered ( approximately 50%) FXR expression, which was further reduced ( approximately 80%) by DCA. In human HCT-116 but not HT-29 colon cancer cells, DCA induced FXR expression and lowered CpG methylation of FXR. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the loss of APC function favors the silencing of FXR expression through CpG hypermethylation in mouse colonic mucosa and human colon cells, leading to reduced expression of downstream targets (SHP, IBABP) involved in BA homeostasis while increasing the expression of factors (COX-2, c-MYC) that contribute to inflammation and colon cancer.",0,259

To determine the degree of conservation of this pathway we searched for key genes among land plants. We used OrthoMCL and the OrthoMCL Viridiplantae database to analyze proteomes of species in bryophytes, lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. We also analyzed small RNA size categories and, in two gymnosperms, cytosine methylation in ribosomal DNA. Six proteins were restricted to angiosperms, these being NRPD4/NRPE4, RDM1, DMS3 (defective in meristem silencing 3), SHH1 (SAWADEE homeodomain homolog 1), KTF1, and SUVR2, although we failed to find the latter three proteins in Fritillaria persica, a species with a giant genome. Small RNAs of 24 nt in length were abundant only in angiosperms. Phylogenetic analyses of Dicer-like (DCL) proteins showed that DCL2 was restricted to seed plants, although it was absent in Gnetum gnemon and Welwitschia mirabilis. The data suggest that phases (1) and (2) of the RdDM pathway, described for model angiosperms, evolved with angiosperms. The absence of some features of RdDM in F. persica may be associated with its large genome. Phase (3) is probably the most conserved part of the pathway across land plants. DCL2, involved in virus defense and interaction with the canonical RdDM pathway to facilitate methylation of CHH, is absent outside seed plants. Its absence in G. gnemon, and W. mirabilis coupled with distinctive patterns of CHH methylation, suggest a secondary loss of DCL2 following the divergence of Gnetales.",4.229,9

The BDNF gene is crucial for development and brain plasticity, is sensitive to environmental stressors, such as hypoxia, and harbors the functional SNP rs6265 (Val(66)Met), which creates or abolishes a CpG dinucleotide for DNA methylation. We found that methylation at the BDNF rs6265 Val allele in peripheral blood of healthy subjects is associated with hypoxia-related early life events (hOCs) and intermediate phenotypes for schizophrenia in a distinctive manner, depending on rs6265 genotype: in ValVal individuals increased methylation is associated with exposure to hOCs and impaired working memory (WM) accuracy, while the opposite is true for ValMet subjects. Also, rs6265 methylation and hOCs interact in modulating WM-related prefrontal activity, another intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia, with an analogous opposite direction in the 2 genotypes. Consistently, rs6265 methylation has a different association with schizophrenia risk in ValVals and ValMets. The relationships of methylation with BDNF levels and of genotype with BHLHB2 binding likely contribute to these opposite effects of methylation. We conclude that BDNF rs6265 methylation interacts with genotype to bridge early environmental exposures to adult phenotypes, relevant for schizophrenia. The study of epigenetic changes in regions containing genetic variation relevant for human diseases may have beneficial implications for the understanding of how genes are actually translated into phenotypes.",4.78,1259

In recent years, aberrant SOX11 expression has been observed in various solid and hematopoietic malignancies, including GC. In addition, it has been reported that SOX11 expression may serve as an independent prognostic factor for the survival of GC patients. Here, we assessed the SOX11 gene promoter methylation status in various GC cell lines and primary GC tissues, and evaluated its clinical significance. METHODS: Five GC cell lines were used to assess SOX11 expression by qRT-PCR. The effect of SOX11 expression restoration after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) treatment on GC growth was evaluated in GC cell line MKN45. Subsequently, 89 paired GC-normal gastric tissues were evaluated for their SOX11 gene promoter methylation status using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and 20 paired GC-normal gastric tissues were evaluated for their SOX11 expression in relation to SOX11 gene promoter methylation. GC patient survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses and a Cox proportional hazard model was employed for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Down-regulation of SOX11 mRNA expression was observed in both GC cell lines and primary GC tissues. MSP revealed hyper-methylation of the SOX11 gene promoter in 55.1% (49/89) of the primary GC tissues tested and in 7.9% (7/89) of its corresponding non-malignant tissues. The SOX11 gene promoter methylation status was found to be related to the depth of GC tumor invasion, Borrmann classification and GC differentiation status. Upon 5-Aza-dC treatment, SOX11 expression was found to be up-regulated in MKN45 cells, in conjunction with proliferation inhibition. SOX11 gene promoter hyper-methylation was found to be significantly associated with a poor prognosis and to serve as an independent marker for survival using multivariate Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that aberrant SOX11 gene promoter methylation may underlie its down-regulation in GC. SOX11 gene promoter hyper-methylation may serve as a biomarker to predict the clinical outcome of GC.",3.032,549

We assessed the frequency of MGMT methylation and protein expression in pituitary adenoma and correlated with patients' age group and prognosis. METHODS: Tumor tissues from 30 patients with pituitary adenoma were evaluated for MGMT promoter methylation status by methylation specific PCR method. All tumors were also immunostained with MIB-1, anti-p53 and anti-MGMT antibodies. RESULTS: MGMT methylation status was noted in 40% of cases (7/20 non-functioning adenomas and 5/10 functioning adenomas). MGMT protein expression on IHC was noted in 72.2% of unmethylated tumors, while only 41.6% of methylated tumors demonstrated protein expression. The mean labeling index of MGMT protein was higher in unmethylated tumors as compared to the methylated group, though the difference was not statistically significant (18.6% vs 8.8%; p=0.131). Tumor regrowth occurred in four unmethylated tumors as compared to none in methylated group. Even though there was no correlation between patient age and MGMT methylation status (p=0.823), we noted that the frequency of methylation in middle age patients (between 30 and 59 yrs) was 64.7%, which was higher compared to other age groups.

Oncogenic activation of the ErbB pathway by mutations and focal amplifications have emerged recently as an important predictive marker of the prognosis of CRC patients. However, in contrast to genetic events, little is known about epigenetic alternations of ErbB-associated genes and their impact on gene expression. Genome-wide methylation in sporadic CRCs (n = 12) paired with adjacent normal tissues have been previously analysed by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 (HM27) at 27,578 CpG sites. For confirmation of our initial genome-wide analysis, we used a published HM27 dataset (GSE25062). Subsequently, CpG island methylation of selected ErbB pathway-associated genes was assessed on 233 CRC samples using methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) and analysed along with various genetic factors associated with CRC [epigenotype, BRAF and KRAS mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI)]. Methylation and expression integration was performed using published datasets including 25 pairs of CRC and normal colon tissues (GSE25062 and GSE25070), and confirmed with real-time PCR. Our previous microarray-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 12 CRCs revealed that four ErbB-associated genes (PIK3CD, PKCBeta, ERBB4, ) were differentially methylated in CRCs. This was further confirmed by statistical re-analysis of an HM27 dataset (GSE25062). Frequent methylation at these loci in tumours was subsequently confirmed by MS-PCR (63%, 43%, 43% and 92%, respectively). Hypermethylation of PKCBeta associated with KRAS mutation (p = 0.04), whereas hypermethylation of ERBB4 associated with high-methylation epigenotypes (HME), BRAF mutation and MSI (p = 0.001, 0.002 and 0.0002, respectively). One of the four analysed genes (PKCBeta) was significantly downregulated in CRC tissue, as revealed by real-time PCR and re-analysis of the GSE25062 and GSE25070 datasets. After careful re-analysis of published methylation and expression data, we conclude that methylation of ERBB4, PAK7 and PIK3CD has no functional role in CRC carcinogenesis. In contrast, methylation seems to have a potential impact on the biology of colorectal tumours by negatively modulating the expression of PKCBeta. Importantly, the relationship between DNA methylation of PKCBeta and gene expression may warrant further attention in the context of colon cancer chemoprevention and anti-cancer therapy.",1.477,647

Long-term, heavy alcohol consumption is associated with a number of deleterious health consequences, such as cancer, heart and liver disease, a variety of neurological, cognitive, and behavioral deficits. Alcohol consumption is also associated with developmental defects. The causes of alcohol-induced toxicity are presently unclear. One of the mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity has to do with its interaction with folic acid/homocysteine or one-carbon metabolism (OCM). OCM is a major donor of methyl groups for methylation, particularly DNA methylation critical for epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and its disturbance may compromise DNA methylation, thereby affecting gene expression. OCM disturbance mediated by nutrient deficits is a well-known risk factor for various disorders and developmental defects (e.g., neural tube defects). In this review, we summarize the role of OCM disturbance and associated epigenetic aberrations in chronic alcohol-induced toxicity. In this review, we summarize the role of one-carbon metabolism (OCM) aberrations in chronic alcohol-induced toxicity. OCM is a major donor of methyl groups for methylation reactions, particularly DNA methylation critical for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Alcohol interference with OCM and consequent reduced availability of methyl groups, improper DNA methylation, and aberrant gene expression can play a causative role in alcohol toxicity.",4.281,1974

Here, we report on DNA methylomes in TET2 wild-type (TET2-WT) and mutant (TET2-MT) cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). We analyzed 85,134 CpG sites [28,114 sites in CpG islands (CGI) and 57,020 in non-CpG islands (NCGI)]. TET2 mutations do not explain genome-wide differences in DNA methylation in CMML, and we found few and inconsistent differences at CGIs between TET2-WT and TET2-MT cases. In contrast, we identified 409 (0.71%) TET2-specific differentially methylated CpGs (tet2-DMCs) in NCGIs, 86% of which were hypermethylated in TET2-MT cases, suggesting a strikingly different biology of the effects of TET2 mutations at CGIs and NCGIs. DNA methylation of tet2-DMCs at promoters and nonpromoters repressed gene expression. Tet2-DMCs showed significant enrichment at hematopoietic-specific enhancers marked by H3K4me1 and at binding sites for the transcription factor p300. Tet2-DMCs showed significantly lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in TET2-MT cases.

Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) has been widely accepted as a prognostic marker and a predictor for endocrine therapy response of breast cancer. To investigate the ERalpha expression and methylation in breast intraductal proliferative lesions, we analyzed ERalpha expression in breast intraductal proliferative lesions including pure UDH (N=98), ADH without DCIS (N=160), DCIS without invasive breast cancer (N=149) by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the methylation status of ERalpha by methylationspecific PCR (MSP) was defined in 217 cases of breast intraductal proliferative lesions. Immunohistochemistry showed that 98/98 (100%) of the UDH cases were positive for ERalpha expression. ERalpha protein expression in ADH (132/160) (92.5%) was higher than in DCIS (101/149) (67.8%). But the ERalpha expression pattern was different with histological diversity of breast intraductal proliferative lesions. The average percent cells staining positive for ERalpha was 35.33% in UDH, 87.75% in ADH and 71.45% in DCIS. ERalpha methylation in 32/60 (53.3%) UDH, 11/77 (10.2%) ADH and 32/80 (40.0%) DCIS. Our results demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the percent of cells staining positive for ERalpha and ERalpha methylation (r=0.831, p<0.001). Taken together, our results underlined that ERalpha expression or methylation may be involved in the breast carcinogenesis and advancement, thus it is not parallel to breast cancer risk in breast intraductal proliferative lesions. No obvious watershed between ERalphapositive and negative breast carcinogenesis was established.

Recently, many age-related DNA methylation biomarkers in peripheral whole blood have been identified. These biomarkers may reflect DNA methylation changes derived from changes in the number of a specific leukocyte cell type during aging. To clarify the source of these age-related DNA methylation changes, we analysed DNA methylation profile of peripheral whole blood from three independent cohorts of healthy subjects and identified age-related DNA methylation CpG sites (arCpGs) using the Spearman's rank test with high reproducibility (Hypergeometric test, P=1.65 x 10(-)(1)(1)). Using a deconvolution algorithm, we found that the proportion of myeloid lineage cells was increased while that of lymphoid lineage cells was decreased in the peripheral whole blood with age (Spearman's rank correlation test, P<0.05, r </= 0.22). The CpG sites, whose methylation levels were significantly different in myeloid cells and lymphoid cells, were preferentially recognized as arCpGs in peripheral whole blood. Moreover, the arCpGs in CD4+ T cells significantly overlapped with that in peripheral whole blood (Hypergeometric test, P=6.14 x 10(-)(1)(2)) and 99.1% of the overlapping arCpGs had consistent positive or negative correlations with age. Though the arCpGs in CD14+ monocytes did not significantly overlap with that in peripheral whole blood (Hypergeometric test, P=0.232), 90.1% of 51 overlapping arCpGs were correlated with age in CD14+ monocytes, peripheral whole blood, and CD4+ T cells consistently. In summary, most of the methylation changes in arCpGs identified in peripheral whole blood come from common or specific DNA methylation changes in leukocyte subtypes, while part of them reflect alterations in the number of specific cell types of leukocytes.",0,1015

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the involvement of Dam methylation in biofilm production in S. Enteritidis strains. The ability to generate biofilms was analyzed in wild type and dam mutant strains. In S. Enteritidis, the absence of Dam affected the capacity to develop pellicles at the air-liquid interface and reduced the ability to form biofilm on polystyrene surfaces. Curli and cellulose production, determined by Congo red and calcofluor assays, were affected in dam mutant strains. Relative quantitative real-time PCR experiments showed that the expression of csgD and csgA genes is reduced in mutants lacking dam gene with respect to the wild type strains, whereas transcript levels of bcsA are not affected in the absence of Dam. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the participation of Dam methylation on biofilm production in Enteritidis or any other serovar of S. enterica. Results presented here suggest that changes in gene expression required for biofilm production are finely regulated by Dam methylation. Thus, Dam methylation could modulate csgD expression and upregulate the expression of factors related with biofilm production, including curli and cellulose.

The epigenetic role of such methylations and the molecular mechanisms by which they induce gene regulation remain elusive. The topology of both physiological and aberrant non-CpG methylation patterns still has to be detailed and could be revealed by using the differential stability of the duplexes formed between site-specific oligonucleotide probes and the corresponding methylated regions of genomic DNA. Here, we present a systematic study of the thermal stability of a DNA oligonucleotide sequence as a function of the number and position of non-CpG methylation sites. The melting temperatures were determined by monitoring the fluorescence of donor-acceptor dual-labelled oligonucleotides at various temperatures. An empirical model that estimates the methylation-induced variations in the standard values of hybridization entropy and enthalpy was developed.",9.112,322
26003740,Association of DNA methylation in the brain with age in older persons is confounded by common neuropathologies.,"['Yang J', 'Yu L', 'Gaiteri C', 'Srivastava GP', 'Chibnik LB', 'Leurgans SE', 'Schneider JA', 'Meissner A', 'De Jager PL', 'Bennett DA']",The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2015,"DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation and development. Previous studies have reported age-related alterations of methylation levels in the human brain across the lifespan, but little is known about whether the observed association with age is confounded by common neuropathologies among older persons. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data from 740 postmortem brains, we interrogated 420,132 CpG sites across the genome in a cohort of individuals with ages from 66 to 108 years old, a range of ages at which many neuropathologic indices become quite common. We compared the association of DNA methylation prior to and following adjustment for common neuropathologies using a series of linear regression models. In the simplest model adjusting for technical factors including batch effect and bisulfite conversion rate, we found 8156 CpGs associated with age. The number of CpGs associated with age dropped by more than 10% following adjustment for sex. Notably, after adjusting for common neuropathologies, the total number of CpGs associated with age was reduced by approximately 40%, compared to the sex-adjusted model. These data illustrate that the association of methylation changes in the brain with age is inflated if one does not account for age-related brain pathologies.

24166889,Differential DNA methylation profiles of infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy.,"['Gunawardhana LP', 'Baines KJ', 'Mattes J', 'Murphy VE', 'Simpson JL', 'Gibson PG']",Pediatric pulmonology,2014,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complex disease that involves both genetic factors and environmental exposures. Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may be important in asthma development. Fetal exposure to maternal asthma during critical periods of in utero development may lead to epigenetic alterations that predispose infants to a greater risk of developing asthma themselves. We investigated alterations in the DNA methylation profile of peripheral blood from infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy. METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 12-month-old infants born to women with (n = 25) and without (n = 15) doctor diagnosed asthma during pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Infinium Methylation 27 arrays (Illumina), containing over27,000 CpGs from 14,495 genes. CpG loci in only autosomal genes were classified as differentially methylated at the 99% level (P < 0.01, |DiffScore| > 22 and delta beta >0.06). RESULTS: There were 70 CpG loci, corresponding to 67 genes that were significantly differentially methylated. Twelve CpG loci (11 genes) showed greater than 10% comparative difference in DNA methylation, including hyper-methylated loci of FAM181A, MRI1, PIWIL1, CHFR, DEFA1, MRPL28, AURKA, and hypo-methylated loci of NALP1L5, MAP8KIP3, ACAT2, and PM20D1 in maternal asthma. Methylation of MAPK8IP3 was significantly negatively correlated with maternal blood eosinophils (r = -0.38; P = 0.022), maternal eNO (r = -0.44; P = 0.005), and maternal serum total IgE (r = -0.39, P = 0.015). Methylation of AURKA negatively correlated with maternal hemoglobin (r = -0.43; P = 0.008), infants height (r = -0.51; P < 0.001) and weight (r = -0.36; P = 0.021). Methylation of PM20D1 was lower in infants born to mothers with asthma on inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Methylation of PM20D1 was lower and MRI1 was higher in infants born to atopic mothers without asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In an Australian study population, exposure to maternal asthma during pregnancy is associated with differential methylation profiles of infants' peripheral blood DNA, which may act as risk factors for future asthma development.",2.704,1465

We enrolled 54 patients with NSCLC between March 2013 and June 2014 from Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in our hospital. The methylation levels in the promoter region of the EGFR gene in cancerous and pericarcinomatous tissue were tested by pyrosequencing. EGFR mRNA expression levels were detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The SPSS software was used for data analysis. We found that EGFR gene methylation levels showed no significant differences among patients of different gender, age, or smoking status. EGFR DNA methylation levels significantly increased (P < 0.05) following NSCLC malignancy upgrading, and showed negative correlation with mRNA expression (P = 0.041). DNA methylation levels of cancerous tissues were significantly higher compared to the corresponding pericarcinomatous tissues (P < 0.05) at stages I, II, and IIIA. The methylation levels at loci 3, 6, 9 among the detected CpG islands were higher in the cancer tissues at each stage (P < 0.05). In summary, our results suggest that the DNA methylation levels of EGFR can be used as an important indicator for the stage of cancer tissue malignancy.",0.775,269

Whereas it is becoming more firmly established that HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with better survival outcomes, believed to be because of better response to chemoradiation therapy, the specific mechanisms for these improved survival outcomes remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between HPV status and promoter methylation in an OPSCC cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine oncogenic HPV type 16 in a retrospective cohort of 121 patients with primary OPSCC. Aberrant promoter methylation of IGSF4, DAPK1, and ESR1 genes, known to be methylated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, including OPSCC, was examined by means of quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received standard therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Univariate associations between HPV and methylation were analyzed using Fisher exact tests followed by multivariable logistic regression. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to model the risk of death given age, race, sex, HPV status, methylation, stage, smoking, and treatment. RESULTS: In univariate logistic regression analyses, HPV-positive status was significantly associated with Caucasian race (P = .02), treatment (radiotherapy only, P = .01; chemoradiotherapy, P = .007), and IGSF4 methylation (P = .005). The final multivariate logistic model, after controlling for patient characteristics (sex, age, smoking, race, and treatment) with backward variable selection among genes, retained IGSF4 methylation (OR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.6-12.8]; P = .005), Caucasian race (OR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.0-8.3]; P = .053), treatment (radiotherapy only vs neither: OR, 11.62 [95% CI, 2.02-66.82]; P = .02; chemoradiotherapy vs neither: OR, 11.15 [95% CI, 1.92-64.65]; P = .01), male sex (OR, 4.7 [95% CI, 1.3-17.0]; P = .02), and younger age (OR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.90-1.0]; P = .008) as independent predictors of HPV-positive status. Cox regression modeling indicated HPV-negative status, age, male sex, smoking, and radiation treatment as independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Methylation of IGSF4 is an independent predictor of HPV-positive status. DNA methylation in conjunction with HPV infection appears to play a role in OPSCC.",1.794,886

Green tea catechins have been reported to modulate epigenetic processes. This review aims to synthesize evidence on the modulation of DNA methylation by green tea catechins. Green tea catechins have been reported to reverse DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes and increase transcription of these genes. Green tea catechins and especially epigallocatechin gallate modulate DNA methylation by attenuating the effect of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). However, the exact mechanism of DNMT1 inhibition is not delineated. Suggested mechanisms include direct enzymatic inhibition, indirect enzymatic inhibition, reduced DNMT1 expression and translation. The possible effect of green tea catechins on other pathways of DNA methylation, i.e. methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, has not been investigated. Furthermore, the link between redox properties and epigenetic modulation by green tea catechins has not been defined either. Since green tea catechins are natural compounds with a rather acceptable safety profile, further research on their action as inhibitors of DNA methylation seems worthwhile.",1.672,1659

 for Medical Oncology / ESMO",2015,"BACKGROUND: O(6)-methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT) silencing by promoter methylation may identify cancer patients responding to the alkylating agents dacarbazine or temozolomide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of MGMT methylation testing both in tumor and cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) from plasma samples using an ultra-sensitive two-step digital PCR technique (methyl-BEAMing). Results were compared with two established techniques, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and Bs-pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Thresholds for MGMT methylated status for each technique were established in a training set of 98 glioblastoma (GBM) patients. The prognostic and the predictive value of MGMT methylated status was validated in a second cohort of 66 GBM patients treated with temozolomide in which methyl-BEAMing displayed a better specificity than the other techniques. Cutoff values of MGMT methylation specific for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) tissue samples were established in a cohort of 60 patients treated with dacarbazine. In mCRC, both quantitative assays methyl-BEAMing and Bs-pyrosequencing outperformed MSP, providing better prediction of treatment response and improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001). Ability of methyl-BEAMing to identify responding patients was validated in a cohort of 23 mCRC patients treated with temozolomide and preselected for MGMT methylated status according to MSP. In mCRC patients treated with dacarbazine, exploratory analysis of cfDNA by methyl-BEAMing showed that MGMT methylation was associated with better response and improved median PFS (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Methyl-BEAMing showed high reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity and was applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and cfDNA. This study supports the quantitative assessment of MGMT methylation for clinical purposes since it could refine prediction of response to alkylating agents.",7.04,207
24748660,Histone H3 K79 methylation states play distinct roles in UV-induced sister chromatid exchange and cell cycle checkpoint arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"['Rossodivita AA', 'Boudoures AL', 'Mecoli JP', 'Steenkiste EM', 'Karl AL', 'Vines EM', 'Cole AM', 'Ansbro MR', 'Thompson JS']",Nucleic acids research,2014,"Histone post-translational modifications have been shown to contribute to DNA damage repair. Prior studies have suggested that specific H3K79 methylation states play distinct roles in the response to UV-induced DNA damage. To evaluate these observations, we examined the effect of altered H3K79 methylation patterns on UV-induced G1/S checkpoint response and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). We found that the di- and trimethylated states both contribute to activation of the G1/S checkpoint to varying degrees, depending on the synchronization method, although methylation is not required for checkpoint in response to high levels of UV damage. In contrast, UV-induced SCE is largely a product of the trimethylated state, which influences the usage of gene conversion versus popout mechanisms. Regulation of H3K79 methylation by H2BK123 ubiquitylation is important for both checkpoint function and SCE. H3K79 methylation is not required for the repair of double-stranded breaks caused by transient HO endonuclease expression, but does play a modest role in survival from continuous exposure. The overall results provide evidence for the participation of H3K79 methylation in UV-induced recombination repair and checkpoint activation, and further indicate that the di- and trimethylation states play distinct roles in these DNA damage response pathways.",9.112,845

CpG cytosines are actively subjected to methylation during tumorigenesis, resulting in gain/loss of function. E2F5 gene has growth repressive activities; various studies suggest its involvement in tumorigenesis. This study aims to investigate the epigenetic regulation of E2F5 in breast cancer to better understand tumor biology. METHODS: The promoter methylation status of 50 breast tumor tissues and adjacent normal control tissues was analyzed. mRNA expression was determined using SYBR(R) green quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and methylation-specific PCR was performed for bisulfite-modified genomic DNA using E2F5-specific primers to assess promoter methylation. Data was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Significant (p<0.001) upregulation was observed in E2F5 expression among tumor tissues, relative to the control group. These samples were hypo-methylated at the E2F5 promoter region in the tumor tissues, compared to the control. Change in the methylation status (Deltameth) was significantly lower (p=0.022) in the tumor samples, indicating possible involvement in tumorigenesis. Patients at the postmenopausal stage showed higher methylation (75%) than those at the premenopausal stage (23.1%). Interestingly, methylation levels gradually increased from the early to the advanced stages of the disease (p<0.001), which suggests a putative role of E2F5 methylation in disease progression that can significantly modulate tumor biology at more advanced stage and at postmenopausal age (Pearson's r=0.99 and 0.86, respectively). Among tissues with different histological status, methylation frequency was higher in invasive lobular carcinoma (80.0%), followed by invasive ductal carcinoma (46.7%) and ductal carcinoma in situ (20.0%). CONCLUSION: Methylation is an important epigenetic factor that might be involved in the upregulation of E2F5 gene in tumor tissues, which can be used as a prognostic marker for breast cancer.",1.576,630
25791328,DNA methylation analysis of cancer-related genes in oral epithelial cells of healthy smokers.,"['De Oliveira SR', 'Da Silva IC', 'Mariz BA', 'Pereira AM', 'De Oliveira NF']",Archives of oral biology,2015,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the smoking habit influence on DNA methylation status in the promoters of the cancer related-genes MLH1, hTERT and TP53 in oral epithelial cells of healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA methylation analysis was performed using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (MSRE) in oral epithelial cells from non-smokers, smokers and ex-smokers. RESULTS: The investigated CpG dinucleotides located at HhaI and HpaII sites in the MLH1 gene promoter were observed to be fully methylated in the majority of DNA samples from the smoker group and statistical differences were found between non-smokers and smokers and between smokers and ex-smokers (p<0.05). The same was observed in the hTERT gene promoter at HhaI sites (p<0.05) and for HpaII sites the unmethylated condition was more frequent in smokers in comparison to non-smokers (p<0.05). For TP53, no differences were found among groups (p>0.05), with the fully methylated condition found to be a common event in healthy oral epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that smoking may induce changes in DNA methylation status in cancer-related genes of oral epithelial cells and that the cessation of smoking is capable of reversing this process. Based on our data, we suggest that DNA methylation status of the hTERT and MLH1 gene promoters are promising markers for screening a set of smoking-related alterations in oral cells.",1.735,519

MGMT promoter methylation represents a favorable prognostic factor and has been associated with a better response to alkylating agents in glioma and systemic lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive extranodal malignant lymphoma. The current standard of care, based on high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy, has improved prognosis but outcome remains poor for a majority of patients. Therapeutic progress in this field is conditioned by limited biological and molecular knowledge about the disease. Temozolomide has recently emerged as an alternative option for PCNSL treatment. We aimed to analyze the MGMT gene methylation status in a series of 24 PCNSLs, to investigate the relationship between methylation status of the gene and immunohistochemical expression of MGMT protein and to evaluate the possible prognostic significance of these biomarkers. Our results confirm that methylation of the MGMT gene and loss of MGMT protein are frequent events in these lymphomas (54 % of our cases) and suggest that they are gender and age related. MGMT methylation showed high correlation with loss of protein expression (concordance correlation coefficient = -0.49; Fisher exact test: p < 0.01), different from what has been observed in other brain tumors. In the subgroup of ten patients who received high dose chemotherapy, the presence of methylated MGMT promoter (n = 4), seems to be associated with a prolonged overall survival (>60 months in three of four patients). The prognostic significance of these molecular markers in PCNSL needs to be further studied in groups of patients treated in a homogeneous way.",0,1969

Recently, it has been shown that lncRNAs play a role in the recruitment of chromatin modifying complexes and can influence gene expression. However, it is unknown if lncRNAs function in a similar way in cancer. RESULTS: Here, we show that the lncRNA ROR occupies and activates the TESC promoter by repelling the histone G9A methyltransferase and promoting the release of histone H3K9 methylation. Suppression of ROR in tumors results in silencing of TESC expression, and G9A-mediated histone H3K9 methylation in the TESC promoter is restored, which significantly reduces tumor growth and metastasis. Without ROR silencing, TESC knockdown presents consistent and significant reductions in tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which ROR may serve as a decoy oncoRNA that blocks binding surfaces, preventing the recruitment of histone modifying enzymes, thereby specifying a new pattern of histone modifications that promote tumorigenesis.",10.81,1142

In this review, we will briefly describe the histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) that have a broad spectrum of non-histone substrates. We will use p53 and nuclear receptors, especially estrogen receptor alpha, as examples to discuss the dynamic nature of non-histone protein lysine methylation, the writers, erasers, and readers of these modifications, and the crosstalk between lysine methylation and other PTMs in regulating the functions of the modified proteins. Understanding the roles of lysine methylation in normal cells and during development will shed light on the complex biology of diseases associated with the dysregulation of lysine methylation on both histones and non-histone proteins.",5.808,5

Upon replication in an independent sample of 356 twins (41 current and 104 ex-smokers), we identified 30 probes in 15 distinct loci, all of which reached genome-wide significance in the combined analysis P < 5 x 10(-8). All but one probe (cg17024919) remained significant after adjusting for blood cell counts. We replicated all 9 known loci and found an independent signal at CPOX near GPR15.

Most of the lead probes (13 out of 15) associated with cigarette smoking, overlapped regions of open chromatin (FAIRE and DNaseI hypersensitive sites) or/and H3K27Ac peaks (ENCODE data set), which mark regulatory elements. The effect of smoking on DNA methylation was partially reversible upon smoking cessation for longer than 3 months. We report the first statistically significant interaction between a SNP (rs2697768) and cigarette smoking on DNA methylation (cg03329539). We provide evidence that the metSNP for cg03329539 regulates expression of the CHRND gene located circa 95 Kb downstream of the methylation site.

The advance in methylation modification of chromatin elements (for both genomic DNA and histone tails) and the emerging roles of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have given us a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying HCC. Recently, methods like genome-wide lncRNA profiling and histone hallmark detection were reported to discover mass tumor-associated lncRNAs epigenetically deregulated by differential chromosome modification, mainly by genomic DNA and histone methylation. Therefore, aberrant methylation modification of certain particular lncRNA genes could be crucial events correlating with unfavorable outcomes in HCC. In addition, amount of lncRNAs could act as a manipulator for DNA methylation or a scaffold for histone modification to affect key signaling pathways in hepatocarcinogenesis. This suggests that methylation modification of chromatin elements may have functional crosstalk with lncRNA.

Silencing or decitabine treatment to block the DNA methylation enzyme DNMT1 inhibited methylation of SOCS1. In contrast, SOCS1 gene methylation and downregulation in CAF activated STAT3 and induced IGF-1 expressiont to support PDAC cell growth. Moreover, CAF facilitated methylation-dependent growth of PDAC tumor xenografts in mice. The ability of patient-derived CAF with SOCS1 methylation to promote PDAC growth was more robust than CAF without SOCS1 methylation.

This study aimed to investigate whether the weight loss induced by two different obesity treatments (energy restriction or bariatric surgery) may affect global DNA methylation (LINE-1) and hydroxymethylation profile, as well as the methylation patterns in inflammatory genes. METHODS: This study encompassed women from three differents groups: 1. control group (n = 9), normal weight individuals; 2. energy restriction group (n = 22), obese patients following an energy-restricted Mediterranean-based dietary treatment (RESMENA); and 3. bariatric surgery group (n = 14), obese patients underwent a hypocaloric diet followed by bariatric surgery. Anthropometric measurements and 12-h fasting blood samples were collected before the interventions and after 6 months. Lipid and glucose biomarkers, global hydroxymethylation (by ELISA), LINE-1, SERPINE-1, and IL-6 (by MS-HRM) methylation levels were assessed in all participants. RESULTS: Baseline LINE-1 methylation was associated with serum glucose levels whereas baseline hydroxymethylation was associated with BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. LINE-1 and SERPINE-1 methylation levels did not change after weight loss, whereas IL-6 methylation increased after energy restriction and decreased in the bariatric surgery group. An association between SERPINE-1 methylation and weight loss responses was found. CONCLUSIONS: Global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation might be biomarkers for obesity and associated comorbidities. Depending on the obesity treatment (diet or surgery), the DNA methylation patterns behave differently. Baseline SERPINE-1 methylation may be a predictor of weight loss values after bariatric surgery.",3.747,995
27279611,"Arabidopsis RNA Polymerases IV and V Are Required To Establish H3K9 Methylation, but Not Cytosine Methylation, on Geminivirus Chromatin.","['Jackel JN', 'Storer JM', 'Coursey T', 'Bisaro DM']",Journal of virology,2016,"In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) employs small RNAs to target enzymes that methylate cytosine residues. Cytosine methylation and dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) are often linked. Together they condition an epigenetic defense that results in chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing of transposons and viral chromatin. Canonical RdDM (Pol IV-RdDM), involving RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V), was believed to be necessary to establish cytosine methylation, which in turn could recruit H3K9 methyltransferases. However, recent studies have revealed that a pathway involving Pol II and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) (RDR6-RdDM) is likely responsible for establishing cytosine methylation at naive loci, while Pol IV-RdDM acts to reinforce and maintain it. We used the geminivirus Beet curly top virus (BCTV) as a model to examine the roles of Pol IV and Pol V in establishing repressive viral chromatin methylation. As geminivirus chromatin is formed de novo in infected cells, these viruses are unique models for processes involved in the establishment of epigenetic marks. We confirm that Pol IV and Pol V are not needed to establish viral DNA methylation but are essential for its amplification. Remarkably, however, both Pol IV and Pol V are required for deposition of H3K9me2 on viral chromatin. Our findings suggest that cytosine methylation alone is not sufficient to trigger de novo deposition of H3K9me2 and further that Pol IV-RdDM is responsible for recruiting H3K9 methyltransferases to viral chromatin. IMPORTANCE: In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) uses small RNAs to target cytosine methylation, which is often linked to H3K9me2. These epigenetic marks silence transposable elements and DNA virus genomes, but how they are established is not well understood. Canonical RdDM, involving Pol IV and Pol V, was thought to establish cytosine methylation that in turn could recruit H3K9 methyltransferases, but recent studies compel a reevaluation of this view. We used BCTV to investigate the roles of Pol IV and Pol V in chromatin methylation. We found that both are needed to amplify, but not to establish, DNA methylation. However, both are required for deposition of H3K9me2. Our findings suggest that cytosine methylation is not sufficient to recruit H3K9 methyltransferases to naive viral chromatin and further that Pol IV-RdDM is responsible.",4.439,901

Importantly, aberrant methylation profiles of various genes are associated with cancer as well as autoimmune disease, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and heart disease. Various methods are available for the detection and quantification of methylation in a given sample. Most of these methods rely upon bisulfite conversion of DNA, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, while methylated cytosines remain as cytosines. Methylation-specific amplification of DNA can be used to detect methylation at one or more (typically up to about 4) CpG sites by using primers specific to either methylated or unmethylated DNA. Alternatively, amplification of both methylated and unmethylated DNA followed by sequencing can be used to detect methylation status at multiple CpG sites. The following chapter provides protocols for bisulfite conversion of DNA, methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR.",0,1164

In cardiac hypertrophy, DNA methylation may control the fetal gene program. We therefore investigated DNA methylation signatures and their dynamics in an in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy based on engineered heart tissue (EHT). We exposed EHTs from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to a 12-fold increased afterload (AE) or to phenylephrine (PE 20 microM) and compared DNA methylation signatures to control EHT by pull-down assay and DNA methylation microarray. A 7-day intervention sufficed to induce contractile dysfunction and significantly decrease promoter methylation of hypertrophy-associated upregulated genes such as Nppa (encoding ANP) and Acta1 (alpha-skeletal actin) in both intervention groups. To evaluate whether pathological consequences of AE are affected by inhibiting de novo DNA methylation we applied AE in the absence and presence of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza, 100 microM, nucleosidic inhibitor), RG108 (60 microM, non-nucleosidic) or methylene disalicylic acid (MDSA, 25 microM, non-nucleosidic). Aza had no effect on EHT function, but RG108 and MDSA partially prevented the detrimental consequences of AE on force, contraction and relaxation velocity. RG108 reduced AE-induced Atp2a2 (SERCA2a) promoter methylation. The results provide evidence for dynamic DNA methylation in cardiac hypertrophy and warrant further investigation of the potential of DNA methylation in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.",5.414,1266

This study investigated whether BDNF methylation is a marker of depression. One thousand and twenty-four participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders in general population elderly (age  65). Clinical levels of depression were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder IV criteria, and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for assessment of moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Buccal DNA methylation at the two most widely studied BDNF promoters, I and IV, was investigated using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform that allows high-throughput investigation of methylation at individual CpG sites within defined genomic regions. In multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for a range of participant characteristics including antidepressant use, depression at baseline, as well as chronic late-life depression over the 12-year follow-up, were associated with overall higher BDNF methylation levels, with two sites showing significant associations (promoter I, Delta mean = 0.4%, P = 0.0002; promoter IV, Delta mean = 5.4%, P = 0.021). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6265, rs7103411 and rs908867) were also found to modify the association between depression and promoter I methylation. As one of the largest epigenetic studies of depression, and the first investigating BDNF methylation in buccal tissue, our findings highlight the potential for buccal BDNF methylation to be a biomarker of depression.",5.62,348

In the present study, DNA methylation levels of tissues of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus were analyzed by the fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) technique over three stages of the aestivation cycle. Overall, a total of 26,963 fragments were amplified including 9112 methylated fragments among four sea cucumber tissues using 18 pairs of selective primers. Results indicated an average DNA methylation level of 33.79% for A. japonicus. The incidence of DNA methylation was different across tissue types in the non-aestivation stage: intestine (30.16%), respiratory tree (27.61%), muscle (27.94%) and body wall (56.25%). Our results show that hypermethylation accompanied deep-aestivation in A. japonicus, which suggests that DNA methylation may have an important role in regulating global transcriptional suppression during aestivation. Further analysis indicated that the main DNA modification sites were focused on intestine and respiratory tree tissues and that full-methylation but not hemi-methylation levels exhibited significant increases in the deep-aestivation stage.",2.055,587

The expression of genes Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the hippocampus was detected by real-time qPCR. The level of proteins DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: Spatial learning and memory in SAMP8 were promoted after i.p. injection of EPO (5000IU/kg/day) and expression of Dnmt3b mRNA and DNMT3B proteins in the hippocampus increased.

We tested for replication of associations between previously identified CpG sites at HIF3A and adiposity in  approximately 1,000 mother-offspring pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Availability of methylation and adiposity measures at multiple time points, as well as genetic data, allowed us to assess the temporal associations between adiposity and methylation and to make inferences regarding causality and directionality. Overall, our results were discordant with those expected if HIF3A methylation has a causal effect on BMI and provided more evidence for causality in the reverse direction (i.e., an effect of BMI on HIF3A methylation). These results are based on robust evidence from longitudinal analyses and were also partially supported by Mendelian randomization analysis, although this latter analysis was underpowered to detect a causal effect of BMI on HIF3A methylation. Our results also highlight an apparent long-lasting intergenerational influence of maternal BMI on offspring methylation at this locus, which may confound associations between own adiposity and HIF3A methylation.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between residential proximity to nearest major roadway, as a marker of traffic-related pollution, fetal growth and placental DNA methylation. METHODS: We obtained residential addresses, placenta samples, and demographic data from 471 women following delivery of term infants. Using generalized linear models we evaluated the association between living close to a major roadway (defined as living </=150m from a primary highway or primary road or </=50m from a secondary road) and fetal growth and DNA methylation of repetitive elements (LINE-1 and AluYb8). We evaluated epigenome-wide methylation in a subset of 215 women to further investigate specific variation in DNA methylation associated with proximity to major roadways. RESULTS: Living close to a major roadway was associated with a 175.9g (95% CI: -319.4, -32.5; p=0.016) lower birth weight, 1.8 (95% CI: 0.9, 3.8; p=0.09) times the odds of being small for gestational age, and 0.82 percentage points (95% CI: -1.57, -0.07; p=0.03) lower mean placental LINE-1 methylation levels in fully adjusted models. In epigenome-wide analyses, 7 CpG sites were significantly associated with residential proximity to major roadways. Additional adjustment for placental methylation did not attenuate the association between roadway proximity and birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Living close to major roadways was associated with both lower fetal growth and significant placental epigenetic changes. However, the observed epigenetic changes appear insufficient to explain the observed association between roadway proximity and fetal growth.",5.559,1442

Atypical methylation patterns in genes related to hormone and adipose metabolism, such as CYP19A1 (aromatase) and PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), are associated with alterations in gene expression which may contribute to pathogenesis of these diseases. If present in early life, it is conceivable similar methylation aberrations may result in hormone perturbations that alter pubertal timing. METHODS: We used Cox proportional hazard models to investigate whether promoter methylation of CYP19A1 and PPARG, independently or in concert with body weight, was associated with age at breast (B2) or pubic hair development (PH2) when assayed in saliva DNA collected from a cohort of New York City, Black and Hispanic girls (N = 130) enrolled in a study of pubertal timing between 6-8 years of age. RESULTS: An inverse association between CYP19A1 methylation and risk of early PH2 was suggested (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90-1.00, p = 0.05). CYP19A1 methylation also appeared to modify risk of early B2 associated with body weight. Specifically, compared to normal weight girls with 'high' CYP19A1 methylation, significantly increased risk of early B2 was observed in overweight girls with 'low' but not 'high' CYP19A1 methylation (HR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.23- 3.76). However, in formal tests for effect modification, the interaction between body weight and methylation did not reach statistical significance (p for interaction = 0.085). PPARG methylation was not significantly associated with PH2 or B2. CONCLUSIONS: Though limited by sample size, our findings suggest methylation of CYP19A1, a critical gene in estrogen biosynthesis, may influence timing of breast development in overweight girls. Consistent with emerging reports, these data support the notion that epigenetic marks in surrogate tissues may improve risk prediction when added to standard plasma and anthropometric indicators, and warrant further study.",1.93,968

Arabidopsis chromosomes are highly DNA methylated in the repetitive centromeres, which are also crossover-suppressed. Here we demonstrate that RNA-directed DNA methylation is sufficient to locally silence Arabidopsis euchromatic crossover hot spots and is associated with increased nucleosome density and H3K9me2. However, loss of CG DNA methylation maintenance in met1 triggers epigenetic crossover remodeling at the chromosome scale, with pericentromeric decreases and euchromatic increases in recombination. We used recombination mutants that alter interfering and noninterfering crossover repair pathways (fancm and zip4) to demonstrate that remodeling primarily involves redistribution of interfering crossovers. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we show that crossover remodeling is driven by loss of CG methylation within the centromeric regions. Using cytogenetics, we profiled meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) foci in met1 and found them unchanged relative to wild type. We propose that met1 chromosome structure is altered, causing centromere-proximal DSBs to be inhibited from maturation into interfering crossovers. These data demonstrate that DNA methylation is sufficient to silence crossover hot spots and plays a key role in establishing domains of meiotic recombination along chromosomes.",10.798,480

Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Array (Illumina, San Diego, CA), we compared genome-wide methylation between 65 actively working dayshift workers and 59 actively working nightshift workers in the healthcare industry. A total of 473 800 loci, including 391 loci across the 12 core circadian genes, were analyzed to identify methylation markers associated with shift work status using linear regression models adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, race, smoking status and leukocyte cell profile as measured by flow cytometry. Analyses at the level of gene, CpG island and gene region were also conducted. To account for multiple comparisons, we controlled the false discovery rate (FDR </=0.05). Significant differences between nightshift and dayshift workers were found at 16 135 of 473 800 loci, across 3769 of 20 164 genes, across 7173 of 22 721 CpG islands and across 5508 of 51 843 gene regions. For each significant loci, gene, CpG island or gene region, average methylation was consistently found to be decreased among nightshift workers compared to dayshift workers. Twenty-one loci located in the circadian genes were also found to be significantly hypomethylated among nightshift workers. The largest differences were observed for three loci located in the gene body of PER3. A total of nine significant loci were found in the CSNK1E gene, most of which were located in a CpG island and near the transcription start site of the gene. Methylation changes in these circadian genes may lead to altered expression of these genes which has been associated with cancer in previous studies. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that among the significantly hypomethylated genes, processes related to host defense and immunity were represented. Our results indicate that the health effects of shift work may be mediated by hypomethylation of a wide variety of genes, including those related to circadian rhythms. While these findings need to be followed-up among a considerably expanded group of shift workers, the data generated by this study supports the need for future targeted research into the potential impacts of shift work on specific carcinogenic mechanisms.",3.343,1059

The aim of this study was to assess whether obesity in humans is associated with changes in expression of sirtuin genes (SIRTs) in adipose tissue and whether epigenetic mechanisms: DNA methylation and miRNA interference mediate in this phenomenon. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The expression of SIRTs and of SIRT1 and SIRT7 mRNA-interacting miRNAs was evaluated by real-time PCR in visceral (VAT) and in subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues of 58 obese (BMI>40 kg/m2) and 31 normal-weight (BMI 20-24.9 kg/m2) individuals. The methylation status of SIRTs was studied by the methylation-sensitive digestion/real-time PCR method. RESULTS: SIRT1 mRNA levels were lower in adipose tissues of obese patients than of normal-weight controls (VAT: P=0.0002, SAT: P=0.008). In contrast, expression of SIRT7 was higher in adipose tissues of obese patients than in the control group (VAT: P=0.001, SAT: P=0.008). The mean methylation of the SIRT1 and SIRT7 CpG islands was similar in tissues with high and low expression of these genes, and there was no correlation between the level of expression and the level of methylation. On the other hand, expression of SIRT1 in VAT of obese subjects correlated negatively with the expression of miR-22-3p (P<0.0001, rs=-0.514), miR-34a-5p (P=0.01, rs=-0.326), and of miR-181a-3p (P<0.0001, rs=-0.536). In turn, expression of SIRT7 in VAT of slim individuals correlated negatively with the expression of miR-125a-5p (P=0.003, rs=-0.562) and miR-125b-5p (P=0.018, rs=-0.460). CONCLUSIONS: We observed obesity-associated down-regulation of SIRT1 and up-regulation of SIRT7 mRNA levels that were not associated with the methylation status of their promoters.

Here, we determined that methylation at R198 and R200 of the EGFR extracellular domain by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) enhances binding to EGF and subsequent receptor dimerization and signaling activation. In a mouse orthotopic colorectal cancer xenograft model, expression of a methylation-defective EGFR reduced tumor growth. Moreover, increased EGFR methylation sustained signaling activation and cell proliferation in the presence of the therapeutic EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. In colorectal cancer patients, EGFR methylation level also correlated with a higher recurrence rate after cetuximab treatment and reduced overall survival. Together, these data indicate that R198/R200 methylation of the EGFR plays an important role in regulating EGFR functionality and resistance to cetuximab treatment.",0,38

There are three types of PRMTs (I, II and III) that produce different methylation products, including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and monomethylarginine (MMA). Since these different methylations can lead to different biological consequences, understanding the origin of product specificity of PRMTs is of considerable interest. In this article, the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy simulations are performed to study SDMA catalyzed by the Type II PRMT5 on the basis of experimental observation that the dimethylated product is generated through a distributive fashion. The simulations have identified some important interactions and proton transfers during the catalysis. Similar to the cases involving Type I PRMTs, a conserved Glu residue (Glu435) in PRMT5 is suggested to function as general base catalyst based on the result of the simulations. Moreover, our results show that PRMT5 has an energetic preference for the first methylation on Neta1 followed by the second methylation on a different omega-guanidino nitrogen of arginine (Neta2).The first and second methyl transfers are estimated to have free energy barriers of 19-20 and 18-19 kcal/mol respectively.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Methylation was measured through bisulfite sequencing and qPCR assays on DNA samples collected from 381 differently aged human subjects. RESULTS: Analyses revealed the methylation of the site in the MT-RNR1 gene and the co-presence of both unmethylated and methylated cytosines in most samples. High methylation levels (>10%) were more frequent in old women with respect to younger controls. A 9-year-long follow-up survey showed that subjects with high methylation levels exhibit a mortality risk significantly higher than subjects with low levels. CONCLUSION: Our data further support the presence of methylation within human mitochondrial DNA and suggest that high levels of methylation of the MT-RNR1 site may reflect a condition of the cell or of the organism unfavorable to survival.,4.649,236
25161227,Modeling DNA methylation dynamics with approaches from phylogenetics.,"['Capra JA', 'Kostka D']","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2014,"MOTIVATION: Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is a prevalent epigenetic modification that is required for proper development in vertebrates. Genome-wide DNA methylation assays have become increasingly common, and this has enabled characterization of DNA methylation in distinct stages across differentiating cellular lineages. Changes in CpG methylation are essential to cellular differentiation; however, current methods for modeling methylation dynamics do not account for the dependency structure between precursor and dependent cell types. RESULTS: We developed a continuous-time Markov chain approach, based on the observation that changes in methylation state over tissue differentiation can be modeled similarly to DNA nucleotide changes over evolutionary time. This model explicitly takes precursor to descendant relationships into account and enables inference of CpG methylation dynamics. To illustrate our method, we analyzed a high-resolution methylation map of the differentiation of mouse stem cells into several blood cell types. Our model can successfully infer unobserved CpG methylation states from observations at the same sites in related cell types (90% correct), and this approach more accurately reconstructs missing data than imputation based on neighboring CpGs (84% correct). Additionally, the single CpG resolution of our methylation dynamics estimates enabled us to show that DNA sequence context of CpG sites is informative about methylation dynamics across tissue differentiation. Finally, we identified genomic regions with clusters of highly dynamic CpGs and present a likely functional example. Our work establishes a framework for inference and modeling that is well suited to DNA methylation data, and our success suggests that other methods for analyzing DNA nucleotide substitutions will also translate to the modeling of epigenetic phenomena.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification which is thought to play a fundamental role in male germline development. DNA methylation reactions rely on the cellular availability of methyl donors, which are primarily products of folate metabolism, where a key enzyme is methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The MTHFR C677T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reduces enzyme activity and may potentially alter DNA methylation processes during germline development. The objective of this study was to determine whether altered DNA methylation in spermatozoa is associated with the MTHFR C677T SNP. DNA methylation was evaluated at the H19, IG-GTL2, and MEST imprinted differentially methylated regions in the spermatozoa of 53 men - 44 oligozoospermic men and nine fertile men with normal sperm parameters via bisulfite sequencing of sperm clones. The 44 infertile men were stratified by severity of oligozoospermia - three normal (>15 million spermatozoa/mL), eight moderate (5-15 million spermatozoa/mL), 23 severe (1-5 million spermatozoa/mL), and 10 very severe (<1 million spermatozoa/mL). MTHFR C677T SNP genotyping was conducted in a subset of 44 peripheral blood samples via restriction fragment length polymorphism. A total of three men - severe oligozoospermic and CT genotype - were found to be altered, which is defined as having >/=50% of their clones altered, where an altered clone was in turn defined as >/=50% of CpGs with incorrect DNA methylation patterns. The incidence of three altered men within the CT subgroup, however, was not significantly higher than the incidence in the CC subgroup. Taken together, altered DNA methylation in spermatozoa was not significantly associated with the MTHFR C677T SNP; however, there was a trend for higher incidence of alterations among severe oligozoospermic infertile men with CT genotypes.",2.298,429

We compared DNA methylation profiles of 28 adenocarcinomas of the lungs of never-smokers with paired adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue. We correlated differential methylation changes with gene expression changes from the same 28 sample pairs. Using principal component analysis, we observed a distinct separation in methylation profiles between tumor and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue. Tumors were generally hypomethylated compared with adjacent nonmalignant tissue. Of 1,906 CpG sites differentially methylated between tumor and nonmalignant tissue, 1,198 were within classically defined CpG islands where tumors were hypermethylated compared with nonmalignant tissue. A total of 708 sites were outside CpG islands where tumors were hypomethylated compared with nonmalignant tissue. There were significant differences in expression of 351 genes (23%) of the 1,522 genes matched to the differentially methylated CpG sites. Genes that were not significantly differentially expressed and were hypermethylated within CpG sites were enriched for homeobox genes. These results suggest that the methylation profiles of lung adenocarcinomas of never-smokers and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue are significantly different. Despite the differential methylation of homeobox genes, no significant changes in expression of these genes were detected.",2.975,625

Transcriptional regulatory regions of the mammalian genome contain a large number of tissue/cell type-dependent differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) with DNA methylation patterns crucial for transcription of the corresponding genes. In general, tissues consist of multiple cell types in various proportions, making it difficult to detect T-DMRs of minor cell types in tissues. The present study attempts to detect T-DMRs of minor cell types in tissues by ultra-deep bisulfite sequencing of cell type-restricted genes and to assume proportions of minor cell types based on DNA methylation patterns of sequenced reads. For this purpose, we focused on transcriptionally active hypomethylated alleles (Hypo-alleles), which can be recognized by the high ratio of unmethylated CpGs in each sequenced read (allele). The pituitary gland contains multiple cell types including five hormone-expressing cell types and stem/progenitor cells, each of which is a minor cell type in the pituitary tissue. By ultra-deep sequencing of more than 100 reads for detection of Hypo-alleles in pituitary cell type-specific genes, we identified T-DMRs specific to hormone-expressing cells and stem/progenitor cells and used them to estimate the proportions of each cell type based on the Hypo-allele ratio in pituitary tissue. Therefore, introduction of the novel Hypo-allele concept enabled us to detect T-DMRs of minor cell types with estimation of their proportions in the tissue by ultra-deep bisulfite sequencing.",3.234,1011
26599865,The Zinc Concentration in the Diet and the Length of the Feeding Period Affect the Methylation Status of the ZIP4 Zinc Transporter Gene in Piglets.,"['Karweina D', 'Kreuzer-Redmer S', 'Muller U', 'Franken T', 'Pieper R', 'Baron U', 'Olek S', 'Zentek J', 'Brockmann GA']",PloS one,2015,"High doses of zinc oxide are commonly used in weaned pig diets to improve performance and health. Recent reports show that this may also lead to an imbalanced zinc homeostasis in the animal. For a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of different zinc intakes, we performed a feeding experiment to assess potential epigenetic regulation of the ZIP4 gene expression via DNA methylation in the small intestine of piglets. Fifty-four piglets were fed diets with 57 (LZn), 164 (NZn) or 2,425 (HZn) mg Zn/kg feed for one or four weeks. The ZIP4 expression data provided significant evidence for counter-regulation of zinc absorption with higher dietary zinc concentrations. The CpG +735 in the second exon had a 56% higher methylation in the HZn group compared to the others after one week of feeding (8.0.10-4 < p < 0.035); the methylation of this CpG was strongly negatively associated with the expression of the long ZIP4 transcripts (p < 0.007). In the LZn and NZn diets, the expression of the long ZIP4 transcripts were lower after four vs. one week of feeding (2.9.10-4 < p < 0.017). The strongest switch leading to high DNA methylation in nearly all analysed regions was dependent on feeding duration or age in all diet groups (3.7.10-10 < p < 0.099). The data suggest that DNA methylation serves as a fine-tuning mechanism of ZIP4 gene regulation to maintain zinc homeostasis. Methylation of the ZIP4 gene may play a minor role in the response to very high dietary zinc concentration, but may affect binding of alternate zinc-responsive transcription factors.",3.234,1585
26307030,DNA Methylation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor Associations With Cigarette Smoking and Subclinical Atherosclerosis.,[],Circulation. Cardiovascular genetics,2015,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke contains numerous agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, and activation of the AhR pathway was shown to promote atherosclerosis in mice. Intriguingly, cigarette smoking is most strongly and robustly associated with DNA modifications to an AhR pathway gene, the AhR repressor (AHRR). We hypothesized that altered AHRR methylation in monocytes, a cell type sensitive to cigarette smoking and involved in atherogenesis, may be a part of the biological link between cigarette smoking and atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA methylation profiles of AHRR in monocytes (542 CpG sites +/- 150 kb of AHRR, using Illumina 450K array) were integrated with smoking habits and ultrasound-measured carotid plaque scores from 1256 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Methylation of cg05575921 significantly associated (P=6.1 x 10(-134)) with smoking status (current versus never). Novel associations between cg05575921 methylation and carotid plaque scores (P=3.1 x 10(-10)) were identified, which remained significant in current and former smokers even after adjusting for self-reported smoking habits, urinary cotinine, and well-known cardiovascular disease risk factors. This association replicated in an independent cohort using hepatic DNA (n=141). Functionally, cg05575921 was located in a predicted gene expression regulatory element (enhancer) and had methylation correlated with AHRR mRNA profiles (P=1.4 x 10(-17)) obtained from RNA sequencing conducted on a subset (n=373) of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AHRR methylation may be functionally related to AHRR expression in monocytes and represents a potential biomarker of subclinical atherosclerosis in smokers.",4.6,153

The levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylated arsenic (MMA), dimethylated arsenic (DMA) and total arsenic (TAs) in urine were higher in males than that in females. Moreover, the levels of iAs and TAs in urine in the subjects with genotype of GSTM1(+) were significantly higher than those with GSTM1(-); the level of DMA in the subjects with GSTT1(+) and GSTM1(+) were higher than those with GSTT1(-) and GSTM1(-), although it is not statistically significant. Secondary methylation index (SMI) was significantly higher in the subjects with genotype of GSTT1(+) than those with GSTT1(-). The levels of TAs in urine, together with the genotypes of GSTT1/GSTM1 were associated with the levels of MMA and DMA.

In addition, it is reported that CLDN6 expression is regulated by DNA methylation in various human cancers and cell lines. However, it is unclear how DNA methylation regulates CLDN6 expression. Here we show the mechanism by which DNA methylation regulates CLDN6 expression in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. METHODS: RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescent staining were utilized to investigate CLDN6 expression in breast cancer tissues and MCF-7 cells. Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) was applied to determine DNA methylation status in CLDN6 gene promoter region. Wound-healing assay and invasion assay were utilized to test mobility of MCF-7 cells treated with 5-aza-dC (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). MeCP2 binding, H3Ac and H4Ac in CLDN6 promoter region were analyzed by ChIP assay. Nuclease accessibility assay was performed for analysis of the chromatin conformation of CLDN6 gene. To study the role of CLDN6 in malignant progression, we used RNAi to knockdown CLDN6 expression in MCF-7 cells treated with 5-aza-dC, and examined the mobility of MCF-7 cells by wound-healing assay and invasion assay. RESULTS: 5-aza-dC and TSA (histone deacetylase inhibitor) application induced CLDN6 expression in MCF-7 cells respectively and synergistically. 5-aza-dC treatment induced CLDN6 demethylation, inhibited MeCP2 binding to CLDN6 promoter and increased H3Ac and H4Ac in the promoter. In addition, TSA increased H4Ac, not H3Ac in the promoter. The chromatin structure of CLDN6 gene became looser than the control group after treating with 5-aza-dC in MCF-7 cells. 5-aza-dC up-regulated CLDN6 expression and suppressed migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells, whereas CLDN6 silence restored tumor malignance in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation down-regulates CLDN6 expression through MeCP2 binding to the CLDN6 promoter, deacetylating H3 and H4, and altering chromatin structure, consequently promoting migratory and invasive phenotype in MCF-7 cells.",1.087,936

Di-N-methylation of cationic amphiphiles derived from several diversely structured AGs resulted in a significant increase in hydrophobicity compared to the parent compounds that improved their interactions with membrane lipids. The modification led to an enhancement in antibacterial activity and a broader antimicrobial spectrum. While the parent compounds were either modestly active or inactive against Gram-negative pathogens, the corresponding di-N-methylated compounds were potent against the tested Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacterial strains.

METHODS: There were 57 CRC patients, 30 adenomas patients, and 47 control patients enrolled in this study. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the promoter methylation status of GATA5, SFRP2, and ITGA4 genes in plasma DNA, and their association with clinical outcome in CRC. The predictive ability of GATA5, SFRP2, and ITGA4 methylation, individually or in combination, to detect CRC or adenomas was further analyzed. RESULTS: Hypermethylated GATA5 was detected in plasma in 61.4% (35/57) of CRC cases, 43.33% (13/30) of adenoma cases, and 21.28% (10/47) of control cases. The hypermethylation of SFRP2 was detected in 54.39% (31/57), 40.00% (12/30), and 27.66% (13/47) in plasma samples from CRC, adenomas, and controls, respectively. ITGA4 methylation was detected in 36.84% (21/57) of plasma samples of CRC patients and in 30.00% (9/30) of plasma samples from patients with colorectal adenomas, and the specificity of this individual biomarker was 80.85% (9/47). Moreover, GATA5 methylation in the plasma was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (P = 0.019), differentiation status (P = 0.038), TNM stage (P = 0.008), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008). SFRP2 and ITGA4 methylation in plasma significantly correlated with differentiation status (SFRP2, P = 0.012; ITGA4, P = 0.007), TNM stage (SFRP2, P = 0.034; ITGA4, P = 0.021), and lymph node metastasis (SFRP2, P = 0.034; ITGA4, P = 0.021).

However, the clinicopathologcial significance and prognostic value of TFPI2 methylation in HCC remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of TFPI2 methylation in HCC after hepatectomy. METHODS: Methylation status of TFPI2 gene was examined in 178 surgical specimens of HCC and 20 normal liver samples using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Methylation of TFPI2 gene was detected in 44.9% (80 of 178) of primary HCC samples, 10.7% (19 of 178) of the corresponding non-tumorous liver samples, and 5.0% (1/20) of the normal liver samples. The mRNA concentrations of TFPI2 in primary HCC tissues were significantly lower than those in corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues and those in normal liver tissues. TFPI2 methylation was significantly associated with higher TNM stage. Patients with TFPI2 methylation demonstrated a significantly poorer prognosis than those without TFPI2 methylation for both overall survival and disease-free survival (P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analyses confirmed that TFPI2 methylation was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (P = 0.002) and disease-free survival (P = 0.000) in HCC after hepatectomy. Moreover, TFPI2 methylation was found to be the only independent predictor for early tumor recurrence of HCC after resection based on multivariate analysis (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of TFPI2 predicts high risk of advanced tumor stage, early tumor recurrence, and poor prognosis, and it could be a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with HCC after hepatectomy.",3.504,1091

Herein, we report a label-free fluorescence detection method for DNA methylation and MTase activity based on restriction endonuclease HpaII and exonuclease III (Exo III). A label-free probe DNA was designed, which hybridized with target DNA (one 32-mer DNA from the exon 8 promoter region of the Homo sapiens p53 gene) to form double stranded DNA (dsDNA). Upon the cleavage action of HpaII and degradation reaction of Exo III, dsDNA changed to single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the fluorescence intensity of thiazole orange (TO) is weak. After the resulting dsDNA was methylated by M.SssI MTase, the action of HpaII and Exo III was prevented, then TO intercalates into the dsDNA and emits strong fluorescence. This method can determine DNA methylation at the site of CpG and distinguish a one-base mismatched target sequence. The fluorescence intensity has a linear relationship with M.SssI MTase activities in the range of 1-10 U mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.16 U mL(-1) in terms of 3 times deviation of the blank sample. The methylation of DNA by a hydroxyl radical triggered by DMSO and CH3CHO was also measured. These results show that the proposed method can specifically and selectively detect DNA methylation and M.SssI MTase activity. Human serum has no obvious effects on the assay performance, indicating that the method has great potential for further application in complex samples.",0,1823

Though family- and population-based studies have confirmed a genetic component, the responsible genes for NTDs are still largely unknown. Based on the hypothesis that folic acid prevents NTDs by stimulating methylation reactions, epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, are predicted to be involved in NTDs. Homeobox (HOX) genes play a role in spinal cord development and are tightly regulated in a spatiotemporal and collinear manner, partly by epigenetic modifications. We have quantified DNA methylation for the different HOX genes by subtracting values from a genome-wide methylation analysis using leukocyte DNA from 10 myelomeningocele (MMC) patients and 6 healthy controls. From the 1575 CpGs profiled for the 4 HOX clusters, 26 CpGs were differentially methylated (P-value < 0.05; beta-difference > 0.05) between MMC patients and controls. Seventy-seven percent of these CpGs were located in the HOXA and HOXB clusters, with the most profound difference for 3 CpGs within the HOXB7 gene body. A validation case-control study including 83 MMC patients and 30 unrelated healthy controls confirmed a significant association between MMC and HOXB7 hypomethylation (-14.4%; 95% CI: 11.9-16.9%; P-value < 0.0001) independent of the MTHFR 667C>T genotype. Significant HOXB7 hypomethylation was also present in 12 unaffected siblings, each related to a MMC patient, suggestive of an epigenetic change induced by the mother. The inclusion of a neural tube formation model using zebrafish showed that Hoxb7a overexpression but not depletion resulted in deformed body axes with dysmorphic neural tube formation. Our results implicate HOXB7 hypomethylation as risk factor for NTDs and highlight the importance for future genome-wide DNA methylation analyses without preselecting candidate pathways.",4.78,1185

DNA methylation has been identified as a possible link but so far it has only been analyzed in candidate sites. OBJECTIVES: We studied the association between DNA methylation and short- and mid-term air pollution exposure using genome-wide data and identified potential biological pathways for additional investigation. METHODS: We collected whole blood samples from three independent studies-KORA F3 (2004-2005) and F4 (2006-2008) in Germany, and the Normative Aging Study (1999-2007) in the United States-and measured genome-wide DNA methylation proportions with the Illumina 450k BeadChip. PM concentration was measured daily at fixed monitoring stations and three different trailing averages were considered and regressed against DNA methylation: 2-day, 7-day and 28-day. Meta-analysis was performed to pool the study-specific results. RESULTS: Random-effect meta-analysis revealed 12 CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) sites as associated with PM concentration (1 for 2-day average, 1 for 7-day, and 10 for 28-day) at a genome-wide Bonferroni significance level (p </= 7.5E-8); 9 out of these 12 sites expressed increased methylation. Through estimation of I2 for homogeneity assessment across the studies, 4 of these sites (annotated in NSMAF, C1orf212, MSGN1, NXN) showed p > 0.05 and I2 < 0.5: the site from the 7-day average results and 3 for the 28-day average. Applying false discovery rate, p-value < 0.05 was observed in 8 and 1,819 additional CpGs at 7- and 28-day average PM2.5 exposure respectively. CONCLUSION: The PM-related CpG sites found in our study suggest novel plausible systemic pathways linking ambient PM exposure to adverse health effect through variations in DNA methylation.

Recently, epigenetic alterations were found to play key roles in both glioma genesis and clinical outcome, demonstrating the need to integrate genetic and epigenetic data in predictive models. To enhance current models through discovery of novel predictive biomarkers, we employed a genome-wide, agnostic strategy to specifically capture both methylation-directed changes in gene expression and alternative associations of DNA methylation with disease survival in glioma. Human GBM-associated DNA methylation, gene expression, IDH1 mutation status, and survival data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. DNA methylation loci and expression probes were paired by gene, and their subsequent association with survival was determined by applying an accelerated failure time model to previously published alternative and expression-based association equations. Significant associations were seen in 27 unique methylation/expression pairs with expression-based, alternative, and combinatorial associations observed (10, 13, and 4 pairs, respectively). The majority of the predictive DNA methylation loci were located within CpG islands, and all but three of the locus pairs were negatively correlated with survival. This finding suggests that for most loci, methylation/expression pairs are inversely related, consistent with methylation-associated gene regulatory action. Our results indicate that changes in DNA methylation are associated with altered survival outcome through both coordinated changes in gene expression and alternative mechanisms. Furthermore, our approach offers an alternative method of biomarker discovery using a priori gene pairing and precise targeting to identify novel sites for locus-specific therapeutic intervention.",4.78,1956

We employed validated methods to assess anthropometric, clinical and dietary data, as well as pyrosequencing to evaluate DNA methylation of the five candidate genes in 165 overweight/obese subjects.

DNA methylation impacts the transposable element (TE) silencing, gene imprinting and expression regulation. RESULTS: Through a genome-wide analysis, DNA methylation peaks were characterized and mapped in maize embryo and endosperm genome, respectively. Distinct methylation level was observed across maize embryo and endosperm. The maize embryo genome contained more DNA methylation than endosperm. Totally, 985,478 CG islands (CGIs) were identified and most of them were unmethylated. More CGI shores were methylated than CGIs in maize suggested that DNA methylation level was not positively correlated with CpG density. The promoter sequence and transcriptional termination region (TTR) were more methylated than the gene body (intron and exon) region based on peak number and methylated depth. Result showed that 99% TEs were methylated in maize embryo, but a large portion of them (34.8%) were not methylated in endosperm. Maize embryo and endosperm exhibit distinct pattern/level of methylation. The most differentially methylated region between embryo and endosperm are CGI shores. Our results indicated that DNA methylation is associated with both gene silencing and gene activation in maize. Many genes involved in embryogenesis and seed development were found differentially methylated in embryo and endosperm. We found 41.5% imprinting genes were similarly methylated and 58.5% imprinting genes were differentially methylated between embryo and endosperm. Methylation level was associated with allelic silencing of only a small number of imprinting genes. The expression of maize DEMETER-like (DME-like) gene and MBD101 gene (MBD4 homolog) were higher in endosperm than in embryo. These two genes may be associated with distinct methylation levels across maize embryo and endosperm. CONCLUSIONS: Through MeDIP-seq we systematically analyzed the methylomes of maize embryo and endosperm and results indicated that the global methylation status of embryo was more than that of the endosperm. Differences could be observed at the total number of methylation peaks, DMRs and specific methylated genes which were tightly associated with development of embryo and endosperm. Our results also revealed that many DNA methylation regions didn't affect transcription of the corresponding genes.",3.986,1215

STUDY FINDING: IVF-induced alterations in promoter DNA methylation might have functional consequences in a number of biological processes and functions during IVF placentation, including actin cytoskeleton organization, hematopoiesis, vasculogenesis, energy metabolism and nutrient transport. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: During post-implantation embryonic development, both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues undergo de novo DNA methylation, thereby establishing a global DNA methylation pattern, and influencing gene expression profiles. Embryonic and placental tissues of IVF conceptuses can have aberrant morphology and functions, resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pregnancy loss, low birthweight, and long-term health effects. To date, the IVF-induced global profiling of DNA methylation alterations, and their functional consequences on aberrant gene expression profiles in IVF placentas have not been systematically studied. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: Institute for Cancer Research mice (6 week-old females and 8-9 week-old males) were used to generate in vivo fertilization (IVO) and IVF blastocysts. After either IVO and development (IVO group as control) or in vitro fertilization and culture (IVF group), blastocysts were collected and transferred to pseudo-pregnant recipient mice. Extraembryonic (ectoplacental cone and extraembryonic ectoderm) and placental tissues from both groups were sampled at embryonic day (E) 7.5 (IVO, n = 822; IVF, n = 795) and E10.5 (IVO, n = 324; IVF, n = 278), respectively. The collected extraembryonic (E7.5) and placental tissues (E10.5) were then used for high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). The main dysfunctions indicated by bioinformatic analyses were further validated using molecular detection, and morphometric and phenotypic analyses. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Dynamic functional profiling of high-throughput data, together with molecular detection, and morphometric and phenotypic analyses, showed that differentially expressed genes dysregulated by DNA methylation were functionally involved in: (i) actin cytoskeleton disorganization in IVF extraembryonic tissues, which may impair allantois or chorion formation, and chorioallantoic fusion; (ii) disturbed hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, which may lead to abnormal placenta labyrinth formation and thereby impairing nutrition transport in IVF placentas; (iii) dysregulated energy and amino acid metabolism, which may cause placental dysfunctions, leading to delayed embryonic development or even lethality; (iv) disrupted genetic information processing, which can further influence gene transcriptional and translational processes. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Findings in mouse placental tissues may not be fully representative of human placentas. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and determine their clinical significance. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study is the first to provide the genome-wide analysis of gene expression dysregulation caused by DNA methylation during IVF placentation. Systematic understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in IVF placentation can be useful for the improvement of existing assisted conception systems to prevent these IVF-associated safety concerns.

25555412,Integrative epigenetic profiling analysis identifies DNA methylation changes associated with chronic alcohol consumption.,"['Weng JT', 'Wu LS', 'Lee CS', 'Hsu PW', 'Cheng AT']",Computers in biology and medicine,2015,"Alcoholism has always been a major public health concern in Taiwan, especially in the aboriginal communities. Emerging evidence supports the association between DNA methylation and alcoholism, though very few studies have examined the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on the epignome. Since 1986, we have been following up on the mental health conditions of four major aboriginal peoples of Taiwan. The 993 aboriginal people who underwent the phase 1 (1986) clinical interviews were followed up through phase 2 (1990-1992), and phase 3 (2003-2009). Selected individuals for the current study included 10 males from the phase 1 normal cohort who remained normal at phase 2 and became dependent on alcohol by phase 3 and 10 control subjects who have not had any drinking problems throughout the study. We profiled the DNA methylation changes in the blood samples collected at phases 2 and 3. Enrichment analyses have identified several biological processes related to immune system responses and aging in the control group. In contrast, differentially methylated genes in the case group were mostly associated with susceptibility to infections, as well as pathways related to muscular contraction and neural degeneration. The methylation levels of six genes were found to correlate with alcohol consumption. These include genes involved in neurogenesis (NPDC1) and inflammation (HERC5), as well as alcoholism-associated genes ADCY9, CKM, and PHOX2A. Given the limited sample size, our approach uncovered genes and disease pathways associated with chronic alcohol consumption at the epigenetic level. The results offer a preliminary methylome map that enhances our understanding of alcohol-induced damages and offers new targets for alcohol injury research.",1.24,1126
25585126,ROS-mediated DNA methylation pattern alterations in carcinogenesis.,"['Wu Q', 'Ni X']",Current drug targets,2015,"Elevated levels of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA methylation are characteristic of various types of cancer cells. However, the relation between these two is not well understood. Here we will discuss the cause-consequence relationship between ROS and DNA methylation. Cancer research reveals that disregulation of DNA methylation results in regional CpG island hypermethylation and generalized genomic hypomethylation. ROS-induced oxidative stress is associated with both aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) promoter regions and global hypomethylation. The DNA oxidation structure, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), can induce DNA hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA methylation at nearby cytosine bases, while another DNA oxidation structure, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), may achieve active DNA demethylation processes, thus, causing DNA hypomethylation. Recently, it has been found that ROS can function as catalysts of DNA methylation, further accounting for TSG promoter hypermethylation. Moreover, ROS may induce site-specific hypermethylation via either the up-regulation of expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) or the formation of a new DNMT containing complex. In addition, these ROS-induced DNA methylation pattern alterations have been implicated with not only malignant transformation, but also the progression of numerous tumors. In conclusion, ROS can influence both aspects of DNA methylation changes through different mechanisms, which play an important role of epigenetic regulation in cancer cells. Therefore, the comprehension of mechanisms leading to epigenetic modifications associated with ROS may help better understand the carcinogenesis and progression, as well as aid in the development of potential biomarkers for better cancer diagnostics and novel therapeutic strategies.",3.021,1216

Methods Fetal cord blood samples from births collected at delivery and maternal demographic and medical information were used in a cross-sectional study to examine fetal DNA methylation of genes implicated in preterm birth among black and non-black infants. Allele-specific DNA methylation analysis was performed using a methylation bead array. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation was applied to examine the relationship between race and fetal DNA methylation of candidate preterm birth genes. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were then conducted to validate the CpG site methylation marker within the two racial groups. Bootstrapping, a method of validation and replication, was employed. Results 42 CpG sites were screened within 20 candidate gene variants reported consistently in the literature as being associated with preterm birth. Of these, three CpG sites on TNFAIP8 and PON1 genes (corresponding to: cg23917399; cg07086380; and cg07404485, respectively) were significantly differentially methylated between black and non-black individuals. The three CpG sites showed lower methylation status among infants of black women. Bootstrapping validated and replicated results. Conclusion for Practice Our study identified significant differences in levels of methylation on specific genes between black and non-black individuals.

Little is currently known about the role of lysine methylation on elongation factors. Here we show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the product of the EFM3/YJR129C gene is responsible for the trimethylation of lysine 509 on elongation factor 2. Deletion of EFM3 or of the previously described EFM2 increases sensitivity to antibiotics that target translation and decreases translational fidelity. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of Efm3 and Efm2, as well as their respective methylation sites on EF2, are conserved in other eukaryotes. These results suggest the importance of lysine methylation modification of EF2 in fine tuning the translational apparatus.",0,261

METHODS: Tumor tissues were collected from 75 CRC patients who received surgical treatment in the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University in the period from 2007 to 2010. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was applied to detect the methylation status of PCDH10 and RASSF1A gene promoters in CRC and adjacent normal colorectal mucosa. The relationship between methylation of PCDH10 and RASSF1A and clinicopathological features of CRC was analyzed using chi-squared test. RESULTS: The rate of PCDH10 methylation in CRC tissue was significantly higher than that in colorectal normal mucosa (58.7%(44/75)vs 22.7%(17/75), P<0.01). There was no significantly correlation between methylation of PCDH10 and patients' age, gender, tumor site, Dukes stage, and lymph node metastasis(all P>0.05). The rate of RASSF1A methylation in CRC tissue was significantly higher than that in colorectal normal mucosa (64.6%(42/65)vs 15.4%(10/65), P<0.01). There was no significantly correlation between methylation of RASSF1A and patients' age, gender, and tumor site (all P>0.05), but the patients in high Dukes stages and with lymph node metastasis had higher RASSF1A methylation rate(92.9%(26/28)vs 43.2%(16/37), 92.9%(26/28)vs 43.2%(16/37), both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CRC tissues demonstrate high level of methylation of PCDH10 and RASSF1A genes, which may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CRC. The aberrant hypermethylation of RASSF1A gene is observed in more advanced CRC, suggesting that the RASSF1A gene methylation may be related to progression of CRC.",0,1568

However, the exact role of this complex is yet to be determined. Following purification of the endogeneous SFPQ/NONO complex, mass spectrometry analysis identified a wide range of interacting proteins, including those involved in RNA processing, RNA splicing, and transcriptional regulation, consistent with a multifunctional role for SFPQ/NONO. In addition, we have identified several sites of arginine methylation in SFPQ/PSF using mass spectrometry and found that several arginines in the N-terminal domain of SFPQ/PSF are asymmetrically dimethylated. Furthermore, we find that the protein arginine N-methyltransferase, PRMT1, catalyzes this methylation in vitro and that this is antagonized by citrullination of SFPQ. Arginine methylation and citrullination of SFPQ/PSF does not affect complex formation with NONO. However, arginine methylation was shown to increase the association with mRNA in mRNP complexes in mammalian cells. Finally we show that the biochemical properties of the endogenous complex from cell lysates are significantly influenced by the ionic strength during purification. At low ionic strength, the SFPQ/NONO complex forms large heterogeneous protein assemblies or aggregates, preventing the purification of the SFPQ/NONO complex. The ability of the SFPQ/NONO complex to form varying protein assemblies, in conjunction with the effect of post-translational modifications of SFPQ modulating mRNA binding, suggests key roles affecting mRNP dynamics within the cell.",0,175

We examined whether altered DNA methylation of the MAPT promoter, with its potential to modulate gene expression, was a common phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease patients with differing aetiologies. We measured MAPT promoter methylation in a brain tissue cohort of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) with defined causative mutations in the PSEN1 gene (Normal = 10, PSEN1 AD = 10), and idiopathic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Normal = 12, LOAD = 12). We found a brain-region-specific decrease in MAPT promoter methylation in PSEN1 AD patients. Overexpression of PSEN1 reduced MAPT promoter activity in an in vitro luciferase study, and led to an increase in methylation of the endogenous MAPT promoter. Overexpression of PSEN1 with a deletion of exon 9 mutation (Deltaex9) led to a smaller reduction in MAPT promoter activity relative to wild-type PSEN1 in the luciferase assay, consistent with a decreased ability to modulate endogenous MAPT gene methylation. Our study indicates a novel effect of PSEN1 on MAPT methylation, and suggests a mutation-specific effect of the PSEN1 Deltaex9 mutation.",3.889,1588

Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled to investigate the putative function of DNA methylaiton. Selected genes expressions were analyzed between PCOS' and controls' granulosa cell. Our results showed that the granulosa cell global DNA methylation of PCOS patients was significant higher than the controls'. The global DNA hydroxymethylation showed low level and no statistical difference between PCOS and control. 6936 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified between control and PCOS-obesity. 12245 differential methylated CpG sites were detected between control and PCOS-nonobesity group. 5202 methylated CpG sites were significantly differential between PCOS-obesity and PCOS-nonobesity group. Our results showed that DNA methylation not hydroxymethylation altered genome-wide in PCOS granulosa cell. The different methylation genes were enriched in development protein, transcription factor activity, alternative splicing, sequence-specific DNA binding and embryonic morphogenesis. YWHAQ, NCF2, DHRS9 and SCNA were up-regulation in PCOS-obesity patients with no significance different between control and PCOS-nonobesity patients, which may be activated by lower DNA methylaiton.

26139010,DNA methylation as a potential diagnosis indicator for rapid discrimination of rare cancer cells and normal cells.,"['Si X', 'Zhao Y', 'Yang C', 'Zhang S', 'Zhang X']",Scientific reports,2015,"The global DNA methylation degree may be a ubiquitous and early biomarker to distinguish cancer cells from benign cells. However, its usefulness in clinical diagnosis was scarcely demonstrated, because the cancer cells isolated from patients were usually very rare. Even if 10 mL of peripheral blood was sampled from a patient, only tens of cancer cells could be isolated. So a method to quantify DNA methylation from small number of cells was needed to apply DNA methylation in clinical environment. In this study, we found that normal breast cell line MCF10A and breast cancer cell line MCF7 cells present significantly different percentage of genomic 5-methylcytosine (p < 0.02, n = 8), it could be a potential indicator for rapid discrimination of rare cancer cells from normal cells. However, conventional mass spectrometry needs usually ~10(6) cells to quantify DNA methylation degree, which was too large to be applied in clinical diagnosis. Here we developed a fast mass spectrometry-based method capable of analyzing the DNA methylation degree from only ~100 human cells. Our method could reveal the different DNA methylation degree between MCF10A and MCF7 cells in less than two hours, having the potential to provide reliable information for clinical application.",5.578,680
26515532,An evaluation of methods to test predefined genomic regions for differential methylation in bisulfite sequencing data.,[],Briefings in bioinformatics,2015,"In the biology of tissue development and diseases, DNA methylation plays an important role. For a deeper understanding, it is crucial to accurately compare DNA methylation patterns between groups of samples representing different conditions. A widely used method to investigate DNA methylation in the CpG context is bisulfite sequencing, which produces data on the single-nucleotide scale. While there are benefits to analyzing CpG sites on a basepair level, there are both biological and statistical reasons to test entire genomic regions for differential methylation. However, the analysis of DNA methylation is hampered by the lack of best practice standards. Here, we compared multiple approaches for testing predefined genomic regions for differential DNA methylation in bisulfite sequencing data. Nine methods were evaluated: BiSeq, COHCAP, Goeman's Global Test, Limma, methylKit/eDMR, RADMeth and three log-linear regression approaches with different distribution assumptions. We applied these methods to simulated data and determined their sensitivity and specificity. This revealed performance differences, which were also seen when applied to real data. Methods that first test single CpG sites and then test regions based on transformed CpG-wise P-values performed better than methods that summarize methylation levels or raw reads. Interestingly, smoothing of methylation levels had a negligible impact. In particular, Global Test, BiSeq and RADMeth/z-test outperformed the other methods we evaluated, providing valuable guidance for more accurate analysis of DNA methylation.",9.617,1702

This process can occur throughout epigenetic modifications of gene expression such as DNA methylation, in which several nutrients participate as cofactors. AIM: To determine DNA methylation status in T1D patients and if it is related to plasma levels of folates and homocysteine (Hcy). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We obtained blood samples from 25 T1D patients aged 13.7 +/- 5.9 years (11 males) and 25 healthy subjects aged 31.1 +/- 7.8 years (16 males). DNA methylation was measured using a colorimetric kit in extracted DNA. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, T1D patients had lower global DNA methylation (0.85 (0.91) % and 1.25 (1.16) % respectively, p < 0.02) and Hcy levels (4.8 (1.1) micromol/L and 7.3 (1.4) micromol/L respectively p < 0.01). There were no differences in folate levels between groups. A significant association between folates and global DNA methylation status was observed in T1D patients (r = -0.564, p < 0.01) and healthy subjects (r = 0.440, p = 0.03).

 States of America",2013,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Upon estrogen stimulation, ERalpha recruits a number of coregulators, including both coactivators and corepressors, to the estrogen response elements, modulating gene activation or repression. Most coregulator complexes contain histone-modifying enzymes to control ERalpha target gene expression in an epigenetic manner. In addition to histones, these epigenetic modifiers can modify nonhistone proteins including ERalpha, thereby constituting another layer of transcriptional regulation. Here we show that SET and MYND domain containing 2 (SMYD2), a histone H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferase, directly methylates ERalpha protein at lysine 266 (K266) both in vitro and in cells. In breast cancer MCF7 cells, SMYD2 attenuates the chromatin recruitment of ERalpha to prevent ERalpha target gene activation under an estrogen-depleted condition. Importantly, the SMYD2-mediated repression of ERalpha target gene expression is mediated by the methylation of ERalpha at K266 in the nucleus, but not the methylation of histone H3K4. Upon estrogen stimulation, ERalpha-K266 methylation is diminished, thereby enabling p300/cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein to acetylate ERalpha at K266, which is known to promote ERalpha transactivation activity. Our study identifies a previously undescribed inhibitory methylation event on ERalpha. Our data suggest that the dynamic cross-talk between SMYD2-mediated ERalpha protein methylation and p300/cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein-dependent ERalpha acetylation plays an important role in fine-tuning the functions of ERalpha at chromatin and the estrogen-induced gene expression profiles.",9.674,1925

The commercially available pyrosequencing systems can harbor two different types of software which allow analysis in AQ or CpG mode, respectively, both widely employed for DNA methylation analysis. OBJECTIVE: Aim of the study was to assess the performance for DNA methylation analysis at CpG sites of the two pyrosequencing software which allow analysis in AQ or CpG mode, respectively. Despite CpG mode having been specifically generated for CpG methylation quantification, many investigations on this topic have been carried out with AQ mode. As proof of equivalent performance of the two software for this type of analysis is not available, the focus of this paper was to evaluate if the two modes currently used for CpG methylation assessment by pyrosequencing may give overlapping results. METHODS: We compared the performance of the two software in quantifying DNA methylation in the promoter of selected genes (GSTP1, MGMT, LINE-1) by testing two case series which include DNA from paraffin embedded prostate cancer tissues (PC study, N = 36) and DNA from blood fractions of healthy people (DD study, N = 28), respectively. RESULTS: We found discrepancy in the two pyrosequencing software-based quality assignment of DNA methylation assays. Compared to the software for analysis in the AQ mode, less permissive criteria are supported by the Pyro Q-CpG software, which enables analysis in CpG mode. CpG mode warns the operators about potential unsatisfactory performance of the assay and ensures a more accurate quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation at CpG sites. CONCLUSION: The implementation of CpG mode is strongly advisable in order to improve the reliability of the methylation analysis results achievable by pyrosequencing.",3.234,161

Therefore, we investigated DNA methylation and mRNA levels of all TETs in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: TET mRNA levels were evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR in primary cancerous and histopathologically unchanged colorectal tissues from patients who underwent radical surgical colon resection (n = 113). DNA methylation levels of the TET CpG island were assessed using bisulfite DNA sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis. RESULTS: We found reduced transcript levels of TET1, TET2 and TET3 in cancerous tissue compared with their histopathologically unchanged counterparts (p = 0.000011; p = 0.000001; p = 0.00031, respectively). Importantly, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed favorable overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) outcomes for patients with high TET2 mRNA levels in histopathologically unchanged tissue (HR(OS) = 0.091, 95 % CI 0.011-0.77, p = 0.028; HR(DFS) = 0.21, 95 % CI 0.04-1.06, p = 0.059). Moreover, we found no DNA methylation in the TET2 and TET3 promoter regions in cancerous and histopathologically unchanged tissue. In contrast, we reported TET1 DNA hypermethylation in a small fraction of patients (n = 12/113). CONCLUSION: To best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate TET mRNA levels in a cohort of CRC patients and correlate them with patients' prognosis. Present study provides the evidence that TET2 mRNA expression may be an independent prognostic factor for disease recurrence and outcome.

DNA methylation of the rat insulin 1 gene (Ins1) promoter was investigated using bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing analysis. Experimental-high-glucose conditions significantly suppressed insulin mRNA and increased DNA methylation at all five CpG sites within the Ins1 promoter, including the cAMP response element, in a time-dependent and glucose concentration-dependent manner. DNA methylation under experimental-high-glucose conditions was unique to the Ins1 promoter; however, palmitate did not affect DNA methylation. Artificial methylation of Ins1 promoter significantly suppressed promoter-driven luciferase activity, and a DNA methylation inhibitor significantly improved insulin mRNA suppression by experimental-high-glucose conditions. Experimental-high-glucose conditions significantly increased DNA methyltransferase activity and decreased ten-eleven-translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase activity. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress did not affect DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter. High glucose but not palmitate increased ectopic triacylglycerol accumulation parallel to DNA methylation. Metformin upregulated insulin gene expression and suppressed DNA methylation and ectopic triacylglycerol accumulation. Finally, DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter increased in isolated islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. This study helps to clarify the effect of an over-nutrition state on DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter in pancreatic beta cells. It provides new insights into the irreversible pathophysiology of diabetes.",3.234,1173

The aim of this study was to estimate the methylation levels of FHIT and BRCA1 promoters using the bisulphite sequencing method (BSP) and high-resolution melting curve analysis (HRM) in the serum of patients with ductal breast carcinoma as a biomarker for the possible application of early diagnosis of breast cancer. The results showed that the methylation levels of both BRCA1 and FHIT promoters were higher in the serum of the breast ductal carcinoma group (BDC group) than those of the breast fibroadenoma group (BFA group), and the healthy individuals group (HI group). However, the methylation levels of the BRCA1 promoters were very low in all three groups compared to the levels of FHIT. The advanced quantitative detection of the samples with HRM showed that the FHIT promoter methylation level of the cfDNA in each serum was also very high in the BDC group compared to the HI group. The methylation level of FHIT was found to be significantly associated with breast cancer (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the methylation quantitative detection of FHIT promoter in serum may be useful for the early diagnosis of ductal breast carcinoma.",1.091,77

RESULTS: Epigenosome-Nanog efficiently replicated in iPS cells after transfection. In HeLa and C2C12 cells Epigenosome-Nanog was stably maintained for more than eight months. The CpG methylation occurred de novo at the Nanog gene promoter region on the epigenosome in C2C12 cells but the degrees of methylation were much lower than those at the same CpG sites on the chromosomes. Among the four CpG sites at the region, the upstream two CpGs underwent methylation in a correlated manner while methylation at the downstream two CpGs was also correlated to each other, and these correlations were commonly shared between the epigenosome and the chromosome. CpG methylation thus was not solely dependent on the nucleotide sequence at the DNA locus. CONCLUSION: The epigenosome may become a useful tool to study the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of a genetic region of interest in mammalian cells.",1.591,1368

These DNA methylation events occur early in cancer development, increase with progression, and may therefore serve as biomarkers for the detection and staging of cancer. In our study, we used an epigenomic reactivation screening approach including Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analyses (COBRA) assays to identify novel methylation markers in late-stage melanoma. Two human xenograft melanoma models have been used to identify genes methylated in cancer and reactivated upon treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Gene expression analysis and promoter scanning for DNA methylation by COBRA assays and bisulfite sequencing were used to identify candidate genes. The methylation status of the CpG island promoter region of genes related to melanoma pathophysiology in skin, lymph node, and visceral metastatic metastases in 28 patients (samples n=35) were assessed. These methylation markers have been evaluated in melanoma metastasis tissue and in control samples from normal skin. The screening in in-vitro and in-vivo systems for methylated genes in melanoma samples showed 10 candidate genes. Using COBRA assays, we detected a methylation pattern in the promoter region of 10 genes with two genes (BASP1, CDH11), together with the patient's age and the log-S100B-level at biopsy, constructing a descriptor with a trend to correlate with shorter time to death.",2.282,546

Mutations in the DDB2 gene cause the genetic complementation group E of xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disease manifested clinically by hypersensitivity to sunlight exposure and an increased predisposition to skin cancer. Here we found that, in human cells, the initiating methionine residue in DDB2 was removed and that the N-terminal alanine could be methylated on its alpha-amino group in human cells, with trimethylation being the major form. We also demonstrated that the alpha-N-methylation of DDB2 is catalyzed by the N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase. In addition, a methylation-defective mutant of DDB2 displayed diminished nuclear localization and was recruited at a reduced efficiency to UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer foci. Moreover, loss of this methylation conferred compromised ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) activation, decreased efficiency in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer repair, and elevated sensitivity of cells toward UV light exposure. Our study provides new knowledge about the posttranslational regulation of DDB2 and expands the biological functions of protein alpha-N-methylation to DNA repair.",0,1915

 Oncology",2015,"PURPOSE: The tumor suppressor gene p16 is frequently silenced and inactivated by hypermethylation in human cancers, including prostate cancer. However, the association between the methylation status of p16 and prostate cancer risk remains ambiguous. This study aimed to assess the association of p16 methylation with prostate cancer risk by a comprehensive metaanalysis. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases before October 2014 with no restrictions. The strength of the association between p16 methylation and prostate cancer risk was assessed by combined odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI). The between-study heterogeneity and the contributions of single studies to the final results were tested by chi-square-based Q test and sensitivity analyses, respectively. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of 1,296 samples from 12 independent studies were enrolled in the present metaanalysis. Overall, a significant association was observed between p16 methylation and prostate cancer risk (OR=3.06; 95% CI:1.34- 6.98;p=0.008). Stratified analyses by ethnic groups further revealed that prostate cancer risk was increased for individuals carrying the methylated p16 compared with those with unmethylated p16 in Caucasian populations (OR=2.51;95% CI:1.01-6.26;p=0.047) and Asian populations (OR=9.50;95% CI:1.78-50.61;p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a strong association of p16 methylation with prostate cancer risk and suggested that p16 methylation might be a potential biomarker for prostate cancer.",0,693

However, little is known about the influence of depressive symptoms, which are common in AD patients, on the brain's reactivity to alcohol cues. The methylation state of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT) has been associated with alcohol dependence, craving and depression, but its influence on neural alcohol cue reactivity has not been tested. Here, we compared brain reactivity to alcohol cues in 38 AD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) using functional magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the influence of depressive symptoms and peripheral DAT methylation in these responses. We show that alcoholics with low Beck's Depression Inventory scores (n=29) had higher cue-induced reactivity in NAc and amygdala than those with mild/moderate depression scores (n=9), though subjective perception of craving was higher in those with mild/moderate depression scores. We corroborated a higher DAT methylation in AD patients than HCs, and showed higher DAT methylation in AD patients with mild/moderate than low depression scores. Within the AD cohort, higher methylation predicted craving and, at trend level (P=0.095), relapse 1 year after abstinence. Finally, we show that amygdala cue reactivity correlated with craving and DAT methylation only in AD patients with low depression scores. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms and DAT methylation are associated with alcohol craving and associated brain processes in alcohol dependence, which may have important consequences for treatment. Moreover, peripheral DAT methylation may be a clinically relevant biomarker in AD patients.",5.62,21

METHODS: N2a cells were treated with DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc) at 3 and 5 mumol/L for 48 hours and histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) at 300, 500 and 700 nmol/L for 24 hours. The expression of NEP after the treatment was evaluated by reverse transcription PCR(RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) assay was utilized to detect the methylation status of NEP gene promoter regions. The level of acetylated histone H3 on NEP promoter was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. RESULTS: 5-Aza-dc induced the demethylation of NEP gene and significantly increased NEP expression in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). TSA treatment significantly enhanced NEP expression by elevating the acetylation of histone H3 on NEP promoter (P<0.01, P<0.05). However, methylation status of NEP promoter was not altered by TSA treatment (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of NEP gene is regulated by DNA methylation and histone acetylation in N2a cells.

ER3, ER4, and ER5 primers were used for methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) to analyze the CpG methylation of promoter region of ERalpha gene. Correlation between ER3, ER4, and ER5 methylation and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients was investigated. RESULT: The methylation status of ER3, ER4 and ER5 was 65%, 26.7% and 61.7% in tissue respectively and 57.5%, 21.7% and 55.8% in serum respectively. The concordance between tumor and serum DNA methylation was 80%, 72% and 92% for ER3, ER4 and ER5 respectively.

With the development of new techniques and tools to measure the genetic signature of tumors, biomarkers are increasingly being used to detect occult tumors, determine the choice of treatment and predict outcomes. Methylation of CpG islands at the promoter region of genes is a particularly exciting biomarker as it is cancer-specific. Older methods to detect methylation were cumbersome, operator-dependent and required large amounts of DNA. However, a newer technique called methylation on beads has resulted in a more uniform, streamlined and efficient assay. Furthermore, methylation on beads permits the extraction and processing of miniscule amounts of methylated tumor DNA in the peripheral blood.

Current diagnostic tests are excellent makers of sensitization but poor predictors of clinical reactivity. Thus oral food challenges (OFCs) are required to determine a patient's risk of reactivity. OBJECTIVE: We sought to discover genomic biomarkers of clinical FA with utility for predicting food challenge outcomes. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling was performed on blood mononuclear cells from volunteers who had undergone objective OFCs, concurrent skin prick tests, and specific IgE tests. Fifty-eight food-sensitized patients (aged 11-15 months) were assessed, half of whom were clinically reactive. Thirteen nonallergic control subjects were also assessed. Reproducibility was assessed in an additional 48 samples by using methylation data from an independent population of patients with clinical FA. RESULTS: Using a supervised learning approach, we discovered a DNAm signature of 96 CpG sites that predict clinical outcomes. Diagnostic scores were derived from these 96 methylation sites, and cutoffs were determined in a sensitivity analysis. Methylation biomarkers outperformed allergen-specific IgE and skin prick tests for predicting OFC outcomes. FA status was correctly predicted in the replication cohort with an accuracy of 79.2%. CONCLUSION: DNAm biomarkers with clinical utility for predicting food challenge outcomes are readily detectable in blood. The development of this technology in detailed follow-up studies will yield highly innovative diagnostic assays.",0,652

METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients were classified into four groups according to their cervical cytology, hrHPV infection, and follow up. Cytology samples were examined for aberrant DNA methylation of DLX4 and SIM1 genes and protein expressions. CaSki cells were treated with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). RESULTS: Group 1 was negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancies. LSIL in group 2 showed a continuance of LSIL for longer than 365 days and LSIL in group 3 showed an upgrading to high-grade (H) SIL or higher (HSIL+) within 365 days of LSIL diagnosis. Group 4 was squamous cell carcinoma. All but group 1 were infected with hrHPV. Significant differences existed in the frequency of DNA methylation between groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.044), between groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.020) for DLX4, and between groups 1 and 3 (p = 0.0003), and groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.005) for the SIM1 gene. DLX4 protein expression was significantly reduced in the DLX4 methylation positive tissues (p = 0.008). The 5-aza-dC treatment restored DLX4 mRNA expressions of CaSki cells (p < 0.005). The LSIL cases with DNA methylation of the SIM1 gene, or both genes, progressed faster to HSIL+ than did the others (p = 0.033 and p = 0.045, respectively). CONCLUSION: Aberrant DNA methylation of the DLX4 and SIM1 genes should be a novel progression marker for uterine cervical LSIL with hrHPV infection.",1.121,553

In plants, DNA methylation process can be directed by small RNAs in process known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) involving two plant-specific RNA polymerases - PolIV and PolV. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of heat stress on the expression of genes encoding key players in DNA methylation - DNA methyltransferase (MET1, CMT3, and DRM2), the largest subunits of PoIIV and PolV (NRPD1 and NRPE1 respectively) and the DNA demethylase ROS1. We also examined the high-temperature effect on two protein-coding genes - At3g50770 and At5g43260 whose promoters contain transposon insertions and are affected by DNA-methylation, as well as on the AtSN1, a SINE-like retrotransposon. To assess the involvement of PolIV and PolV in heat stress response, the promoter methylation status and transcript levels of these genes were compared between wild type and double mutant lacking NRPD1 and NRPE1. The results demonstrate coordinated up-regulation of the DRM2, NRPD1 and NRPE1 in response to high temperature and suggest that PolIV and/or PolV might be required for the induction of DRM2 expression under heat stress. The ROS1 expression was confirmed to be suppressed in the mutant lacking active PolIV and PolV that might be a consequence of abolished DNA methylation. The increased expression of At3g50770 in response to elevated temperature correlated with reduced promoter DNA methylation, while the stress response of At5g43260 did not show inverse correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression. Our results also imply that PolIV and/or PolV could regulate gene expression under stress conditions not only through RdDM but also by acting in other regulatory processes.",6.841,673

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The data of 57 AML patients aged 20 to 79 years were analyzed. The methylation status of the genes was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The signs of the AM of >/=1 gene were detected in 52 (91.2%) of the 57 patients. The most common finding was AM of simultaneously 2 or 3 genes: in 29.8 and 21.1% of the patients, respectively. Concurrent methylation of 3-5 genes proved to be a more frequent finding in AML patients with myelodysplasia: in 7 (70%) of 10 patients. The proportion of patients with methylation of 5 genes was considerably higher in a group of patients with a complex karyotype: 50% versus 8.3% among other patients (odds ratio: 11.0; 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 61.6; p=0.01). There were no differences in the median overall and relapse-free survival rates in patients with a normal karyotype and without FLT3 and NPM mutations, who received induction therapy, in relation to the number of genes with AM. CONCLUSION: AM of the p15NK4b and SOX7 genes and Wnt signaling pathway antagonists is detected in the majority of patients with AML, which allows hypomethylating agents to be recommended for the treatment of patients who cannot use intensive cytostatic therapy for different reasons. The detection of a large number of genes with the aberrant methylation status in most AML patients with myelodysplasia or a complex karyotype serves as the basis for initiating trials to evaluate the efficiency of a combination of 5-azacytidine and cytostatics.",0.049,1772

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR and methylation-specific PCR were used to detect the expression level of miR-182 and its promoter methylation status in five lung cancer cell lines (A549, L9981, NL9980, 95C and 95D). DNA sequencing was used to confirm the methylation results. RESULTS: The level of miR-182 expression significantly differs among these lung cancer cell lines. The highly metastatic human lung cancer cell lines, namely, A549 and L9981, demonstrate a relatively lower expression level of miR-182 compared with the lowly metastatic human lung cancer cell line 95C. Methylation-specific PCR and DNA sequencing assay results indicate that these lung cancer cell lines present different levels of miR-182 promoter methylation, and the highest methylation level is observed in A549 cells.

RESULTS: CdCl2 had toxic effects on HEK293 cells, and the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 1.78 micromol/L. After exposure of CdCl2 for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, the morphology of HEK293 cells was altered, and the high dose group (2.0 micromol/L) showed vacuolar changes and fuzzy appearance.

The importance of methylation in neural crest migration is unknown. Here, we show that SAHH is required for emigration of polarized neural crest cells, indicating that methylation is essential for neural crest migration. Although nuclear histone methylation regulates neural crest gene expression, SAHH and lysine-methylated proteins are abundant in the cytoplasm of migratory neural crest cells. Proteomic profiling of cytoplasmic, lysine-methylated proteins from migratory neural crest cells identified 182 proteins, several of which are cytoskeleton related. A methylation-resistant form of one of these proteins, the actin-binding protein elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EF1alpha1), blocks neural crest migration. Altogether, these data reveal a novel and essential role for post-translational nonhistone protein methylation during neural crest migration and define a previously unknown requirement for EF1alpha1 methylation in migration.",0,1326

Recent proteomic mass spectrometry studies reported arginine methylation of ataxin-2-like (ATXN2L), the paralog of ataxin-2, a protein that is implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. Here, we investigated the methylation state of ATXN2L and its significance for ATXN2L localization. We first confirmed that ATXN2L is asymmetrically dimethylated in vivo, and observed that the nuclear localization of ATXN2L is altered under methylation inhibition. We further discovered that ATXN2L associates with the protein arginine-N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Finally, we showed that neither mutation of the arginine-glycine-rich motifs of ATXN2L nor methylation inhibition alters ATXN2L localization to stress granules, suggesting that methylation of ATXN2L is probably not mandatory.",3.246,101

As a weak estrogenic chemical, bisphenol A (BPA) has been extensively studied for reproductive toxicity. In order to explore the effects of BPA on epigenetic modification in gonads of zebrafish Danio rerio, we measured the global DNA methylation together with the gene expression of DNA methyltransferase (dnmts), glycine N-methyltransferase (gnmt), and ten-eleven translocation (tets) in gonads of D. rerio under BPA exposure by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR method, respectively. The global level of DNA methylation was significantly decreased in ovaries after exposed to BPA for 7 days, and testes following 35-day exposure. Moreover, the global level of DNA methylation was also significantly reduced in testes after exposed to 15mug/L BPA for 7 days. Besides the alteration of the global level of DNA methylation, varying degrees of transcriptional changes of dnmts, gnmt and tets were detected in gonads of D. rerio under BPA exposure. The present study suggested that BPA might cause the global DNA demethylation in gonads of zebrafish by regulating the transcriptional changes of the DNA methylation/demethylation-associated genes (dnmts, gnmt, and tets).",2.762,814

Microalgal cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Dunaliella tertiolecta were prepared and examined. It appeared that direct acid methylation extracted higher fatty acid content than the solvent-based Soxhlet extraction process. It also revealed that the latter was prone to extract a significant amount of nonlipid hydrophobic impurities, including hydrophobic proteins and phytol-type compounds, while direct methylation produces essentially pure ester product. This work demonstrates that direct acid methylation provides superior fatty acid extraction, promising an efficient process for either quantification of lipid content or production of biodiesel.",1.735,1503

Whether WGD is accompanied by the evolution of epigenetic regulators remains to be explored. Here we investigate whole genome methylation, gene expression, and miRNA regulation among monoploid, diploid, and triploid rice plants isolated from a twin-seedling population. The DNA methylation patterns in the three different ploidy plants were highly similar, with DNA methylation primarily enriched in the promoters. We examined the methylation of single genes and detected around 25,500 methylated genes, of which 22,751 were methylated in all three lines. Significantly divergent DNA methylation patterns between each pair of three lines were only detected in 64 genes, though more genes were found to exhibit differential expression. Analysis of DNA methylation and expression patterns showed that higher DNA methylation levels upstream of the transcription start sites are correlated with higher levels of expression of related genes; whereas higher DNA methylation levels in gene body regions are correlated with lower levels of expression. We also carried out high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries and identified 36 new miRNAs. These miRNAs have different expression levels depending on the ploidy.",3.948,1245

We aimed to analyze DNA methylation affecting the WNT pathway genes in colorectal carcinogenesis in promoter and gene body regions using whole methylome analysis in 9 colorectal cancer, 15 adenoma, and 6 normal tumor adjacent tissue (NAT) samples by methyl capture sequencing. Functional methylation was confirmed on 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-treated colorectal cancer cell line datasets. In parallel with the DNA methylation analysis, mutations of WNT pathway genes (APC, beta-catenin/CTNNB1) were analyzed by 454 sequencing on GS Junior platform. Most differentially methylated CpG sites were localized in gene body regions (95% of WNT pathway genes). In the promoter regions, 33 of the 160 analyzed WNT pathway genes were differentially methylated in colorectal cancer vs. normal, including hypermethylated AXIN2, CHP1, PRICKLE1, SFRP1, SFRP2, SOX17, and hypomethylated CACYBP, CTNNB1, MYC; 44 genes in adenoma vs. NAT; and 41 genes in colorectal cancer vs. adenoma comparisons. Hypermethylation of AXIN2, DKK1, VANGL1, and WNT5A gene promoters was higher, while those of SOX17, PRICKLE1, DAAM2, and MYC was lower in colon carcinoma compared to adenoma. Inverse correlation between expression and methylation was confirmed in 23 genes, including APC, CHP1, PRICKLE1, PSEN1, and SFRP1. Differential methylation affected both canonical and noncanonical WNT pathway genes in colorectal normal-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation appears already in adenomas as an early event of colorectal carcinogenesis.",4.78,761

These bouts are accompanied by a suite of reversible physiological and biochemical changes; however, much remains to be discovered about the molecular mechanisms involved. Given the seasonal nature of hibernation, it stands to reason that underlying plastic epigenetic mechanisms should exist. One such form of epigenomic regulation involves the reversible modification of cytosine bases in DNA by methylation. DNA methylation is well known to be a mechanism that confers upon DNA its cellular identity during differentiation in response to innate developmental cues. However, it has recently been hypothesized that DNA methylation also acts as a mechanism for adapting genome function to changing external environmental and experiential signals over different time scales, including during adulthood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation is altered during hibernation in adult wild animals. This study evaluated global changes in DNA methylation in response to hibernation in the liver and skeletal muscle of thirteen-lined ground squirrels along with changes in expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1/3B) and methyl binding domain proteins (MBDs). A reduction in global DNA methylation occurred in muscle during torpor phases whereas significant changes in DNMTs and MBDs were seen in both tissues. We also report dynamic changes in DNA methylation in the promoter of the myocyte enhancer factor 2C (mef2c) gene, a candidate regulator of metabolism in skeletal muscle. Taken together, these data show that genomic DNA methylation is dynamic across torpor-arousal bouts during winter hibernation, consistent with a role for this regulatory mechanism in contributing to the hibernation phenotype.",0,548

The aim of this study was to identify newly hypermethylated genes in ulcerative colitis (UC) using a genome-wide DNA methylation approach. Using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, we screened the DNA methylation changes in three normal colon controls and eight UC patients. Using these methylation profiles, 48 probes associated with CpG promoter methylation showed differential hypermethylation between UC patients and normal controls. Technical validations for methylation analyses in a larger series of UC patients (n = 79) were performed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing analysis. We finally found that three genes (FAM217B, KIAA1614 and RIBC2) that were significantly elevating the promoter methylation levels in UC compared to normal controls. Interestingly, we confirmed that three genes were transcriptionally silenced in UC patient samples by qRT-PCR, suggesting that their silencing is correlated with the promoter hypermethylation. Pathway analyses were performed using GO and KEGG databases with differentially hypermethylated genes in UC. Our results highlight that aberrant hypermethylation was identified in UC patients which can be a potential biomarker for detecting UC. Moreover, pathway-enriched hypermethylated genes are possibly implicating important cellular function in the pathogenesis of UC. Overall, this study describes a newly hypermethylated gene panel in UC patients and provides new clinical information that can be used for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of IBD.",2.862,421

Here, we use DNA methylation analysis to examine retrotransposons in mouse male germ cells. DNA methylation of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) is dependent on piRNA, and younger LINEs exhibit greater piRNA dependence. In contrast, most long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons produce lower levels of piRNAs and do not show significant piRNA dependence. The relationship between DNA methylation and corresponding piRNA expression of several LTR retrotransposons was reduced in Mili-null cells, but not Miwi2-null cells. These observations raise the possibility of piRNA-dependent DNA methylation without Miwi2. Therefore, it appears that the molecular mechanisms of the gene silencing of retrotransposons are more complicated than previously thought.",8.358,926

Under general situations, methylation in a gene promoter region is frequently accompanied by transcriptional suppression, and those genes that are highly methylated display the phenomenon of low expression. In contrast, those genes whose methylation level is low display the phenomenon of active expression. In this study, we conducted DNA methylation analysis on the CpG sites within the promoter regions of five adipose tissue-specific transcriptional factors-Adiponectin, Chemerin, Leptin, Smaf-1, and Vaspin-and examined their messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels in different mouse tissues. We also performed analyses on the correlation between the DNA methylation levels of these genes and their mRNA expression levels in these tissues. The correlation coefficient for Leptin was the highest, and it displayed a high expression in an adipose tissue-specific manner. Thus, we cloned the regulatory region of Leptin gene and incorporated its promoter into the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 and constructed a recombinant plasmid named pEGFP-N1-(p-Lep). This recombinant plasmid was first verified by DNA sequencing and then transfected into mouse pre-adipocytes via electroporation. Measurement of the activity of luciferase (reporter) indicated that p-Lep was capable of driving the expression of the reporter gene. This study has paved a solid basis for subsequent studies on generating transgenic animals.",1.735,1675

METHODS: From January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2010, an exploratory case-control study was conducted on childhood AL among children who were less than 15 years of age in Shanghai, China. A total of 131 patients with newly diagnosed AL were recruited from 3 Shanghai children hospitals. The controls selected from the same hospital were healthy children who attended the physical check-up held by the department of Children's Healthcare, or who visited the clinic of developmental pediatrics or orthopedics (excluding blood diseases and malignant tumors). 140 controls matched with cases in gender and age were included in this study. Chemical exposure were investigated by questionnaires, methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was adopted to analyze the methylation or deletion status of 8 genes, and gene-environment interactions were analyzed by relative excess risk of interaction (RERI), attributable proportion of interaction (API) and synergy index (S). RESULTS: There were 131 and 140 subjects in case and control group, who were aged (6.9 +/- 3.8) and (6.9 +/- 3.9) years old (t = 0.01, P = 0.911), respectively. After adjusting age and other potential confounding factors, chemical substances' exposure of children/mother/father were all significantly higher in cases than that in controls (Children: OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.69-9.02; Mother: OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.12-6.52; Father: OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05-3.47). For the 8 genes analyzed, the methylation status of DAPK and PTEN and P73 in case group were significantly higher than that in control group (cases: 3.1% (4 cases), 16.0% (21 cases), 7.6% (10 cases); controls: 0.7% (1 case), 2.9% (4 cases), 0.7% (1 case); chi(2): 7.11, 16.90, 11.38; P value: 0.029, 0.000, 0.003). The methylation status of P16 in case group was significantly lower than that in control group (cases: 3.8% (5 cases); controls: 8.6% (12 cases), chi(2) = 10.33, P = 0.007). The interactions of children chemical substances' exposure and 3 genes' (PTEN, P16 and P73) methylation status were probably existed after adjusted for confounding factors (PTEN: RERI = -7.01, API = -2.14, S = 0.24; P16: RERI = 4.08, API = 0.53, S = 2.59; P73: RERI = 4.32, API = 0.48, S = 2.19), we also found the potential interaction between maternal chemical substances' exposure and PTEN, P16 gene methylation status (PTEN: RERI = -1.30, API = -0.38, S = 0.65; P16: RERI = 1.70, API = 0.38, S = 1.97). CONCLUSION: The study suggested the strong combined effects of chemical substances exposure of children and abnormal methylation status were risk factors of childhood AL, and there existed different interaction between them, which may indicate the important role in the pathogenesis process of childhood AL.",0,324

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding biological embedding of early-life experiences. To this end, we conducted a literature search to identify studies investigating early-life exposures in relation to DNA methylation changes. In addition, we summarize the challenges faced in investigations of epigenetic effects, stemming from the peculiarities of this emergent and complex field. A proper systematic review and meta-analyses were not feasible given the nature of the evidence. RESULTS: We identified seven studies on early-life socio-economic circumstances, 10 studies on childhood obesity and six studies on early-life nutrition all relating to DNA methylation changes that met the stipulated inclusion criteria. The pool of evidence gathered, albeit small, favours a role of epigenetics and DNA methylation in biological embedding, but replication of findings, multiple comparison corrections, publication bias and causality are concerns remaining to be addressed in future investigations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we hypothesize that epigenetics, in particular DNA methylation, is a plausible mechanism through which early-life exposures are biologically embedded. This review describes the current status of the field and acts as a stepping stone for future, better designed investigations on how early-life exposures might become biologically embedded through epigenetic effects.",2.734,1452

Chromatin associated with PcG targets is bivalent in stem cells, while TS genes are not normally bivalent. PcG target methylation changes have been identified in tumor stem cells, and abnormal methylation is found in TS genes in cancers. If the epigenetic states of genes influence DNA methylation, then methylation of PcG targets and TS genes may evolve differently during cancer development. More importantly, methylation changes may be part of a sequence in tumorigenesis. METHODS: Chromatin and methylation states of 4 PcG targets and 2 TS genes were determined in colon cancer cells. The methylation states were also detected in 100 pairs of colon cancer samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to reveal whether TS methylation or PcG methylation was the main methylation change associated with colon cancers. RESULTS: Chromatin and methylation states differ in colon cancer cell lines. The methylation states within PcG targets clustered independently from the methylation states in TS genes, a finding we previously reported in liver cancers. PCA in colon cancers revealed the strongest association with methylation changes in 2 TS genes, HIC1 and RassF1A. Loss of HIC1 methylation correlated with decreased tumor migration. CONCLUSIONS: PcG and TS methylation states cluster independently from each other. The deduced principle component correlated better with TS methylation than PcG methylation in colon cancer. Abnormal methylation changes may represent a sequential biomarker profile to identify developing colon cancer.",3.93,1879

Recent studies have clarified the existence of the active DNA demethylation pathways that start with oxidization of 5-methylcytosine (5meC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes, followed by the action of base-excision-repair pathways. Here, we investigated the effects of a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet on the hepatic DNA methylation of mice by precisely quantifying 5meC using a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and by investigating the regulatory pathways, including DNA demethylation. Although feeding the MCD diet for 1 week induced hepatic steatosis and lower level of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, it did not cause a significant reduction in the 5meC content. On the other hand, the MCD diet significantly upregulated the gene expression of the Tet enzymes, Tet2 and Tet3, and the base-excision-repair enzymes, thymine DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic-endonuclease 1. At the same time, the gene expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 and a, was also significantly increased by the MCD diet. These results suggest that the DNA methylation level is precisely regulated even when dietary methyl donors are restricted. Methyl-deficient diets are well known to induce oxidative stress and the oxidative-stress-induced DNA damage, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), is reported to inhibit DNA methylation. In this study, we also clarified that the increase in 8OHdG number per DNA by the MCD diet is approximately 10 000 times smaller than the reduction in 5meC number, suggesting the contribution of 8OHdG formation to DNA methylation would not be significant.",1.5,110

Results were compared with the 24 h IVM protocol (control) usually employed for bovine oocytes. Cleavage rates and blastocyst yields were significantly reduced in oocytes after extended IVM. No significant differences were observed in the methylation of entire alleles in oocytes for the genes bH19, bSNRPN, bZAR1, bOct4 and bDNMT3A. However, we found differentially methylated CpG sites in the bDNMT3Ls locus in oocytes after extended IVM and in embryos derived from them compared with controls. Moreover, embryos derived from the 48 h matured oocyte group were significantly less methylated at CpG5 and CpG7 compared with the 24 h group. CpG7 was significantly hypermethylated in embryos produced from the control oocytes, but not in oocytes matured for 48 h. Furthermore, methylation for CpG5-CpG8 of bDNMT3Ls was significantly lower in oocytes of the 24 h group compared with embryos derived therefrom, whereas no such difference was found for oocytes and embryos of the in vitro aged group. Expression of most of the selected genes was not affected by duration of IVM. However, transcript abundance for the imprinted gene bIGF2R was significantly reduced in oocytes analyzed after extended IVM compared with control oocytes. Transcript levels for bPRDX1, bDNMT3A and bBCLXL were significantly reduced in 4- to 8-cell embryos derived from in vitro aged oocytes.

The crucial role of DNA methylation has been observed in cellular differentiation, embryogenesis, genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Furthermore, DNA methylation takes part in disease susceptibility, responses to environmental stimuli and the biodiversity of natural populations. In plant, different types of environmental stress have demonstrated the ability to alter the archetype of DNA methylation through the genome, change gene expression and confer a mechanism of adaptation. DNA methylation dynamics are regulated by three processes de novo DNA methylation, methylation maintenance and DNA demethylation. These processes have their similarities and differences between mammals and plants. Furthermore, the dysregulation of DNA methylation dynamics represents one of the primary molecular mechanisms of developing diseases in mammals.

We also explored the relationship between methylation status of RIZ1 and clinicopathological features in RCC patients. RESULTS: RIZ1 expression was down-regulated or lost in OS-RC-2, 769-P, Caki-1, 786-O and A498 RCC cell lines. Restored expression of RIZ1 was detected after addition of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine with/without trichostatin A, suggesting that DNA methylation directly mediates its silencing. The RIZ1 expression was significantly reduced in RCCs compared to adjacent non-malignant renal samples (P<0.001). Aberrant methylation was detected in 15 of 50 (30%) RCCs and in 2 of 28 (7%) adjacent non- malignant renal samples (P=0.02). No statistically significant correlation between methylated and unmethylated cases with regard to age, gender, pathological stage and grade was observed. CONCLUSIONS: RIZ1 expression is down-regulated in human RCC, and this down-regulation is associated with methylation. RIZ1 methylation may play a role in renal carcinogenesis.",0.257,1161

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood lipid levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Observed DNA methylation changes were also further analyzed to examine their relationship with previous hospitalized myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were determined in whole blood samples of 1776 subjects of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F4 cohort using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Ten novel lipid-related CpG sites annotated to various genes including ABCG1, MIR33B/SREBF1, and TNIP1 were identified. CpG cg06500161, located in ABCG1, was associated in opposite directions with both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta coefficient=-0.049; P=8.26E-17) and triglyceride levels (beta=0.070; P=1.21E-27). Eight associations were confirmed by replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F3 study (n=499) and in the Invecchiare in Chianti, Aging in the Chianti Area study (n=472). Associations between triglyceride levels and SREBF1 and ABCG1 were also found in adipose tissue of the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource cohort (n=634). Expression analysis revealed an association between ABCG1 methylation and lipid levels that might be partly mediated by ABCG1 expression. DNA methylation of ABCG1 might also play a role in previous hospitalized myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval=1.06-1.25).

Smoking, genetics, male sex and increased age are major factors associated with developing AAA. Rupture contributes to around 2% of deaths in all Caucasians over 65, and there is no pharmaco-therapeutic treatment. Methylation is an epigenetic modification to DNA, where a methyl group is added to a cytosine base 5' to a guanine (CpG dinucleotide). Methylation patterns are long term, inherited signatures that can induce changes in gene transcription, and can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Methylation changes are involved in hypertension and atherosclerosis, both of which are risk factors of, and often coexist with AAA. Extra-cellular matrix degradation and inflammation, both important pathological hallmarks of AAA, are also promoted by changes in CpG methylation in other diseases. Additionally, the adverse effects of smoking and ageing take place largely through epigenetic manipulation of the genome. Every factor associated with AAA appears to be associated with DNA methylation, yet no direct evidence confirms this. Future work to identify a link between global methylation and AAA, and differentially methylated regions may reveal valuable insight. The identification of a common epigenetic switching process may also signify a promising future for AAA pharmaco-therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic therapies are being designed to target pathogenic CpG methylation changes in other diseases, and it is feasible that these therapies may also be applicable to AAA in the future.",3.994,299

Meanwhile, treatment of buffalo SCNT embryos with Scriptaid also resulted in higher acetylation levels of H3K18 and lower methylation levels of global DNA at the blastocyst stage, which was similar to fertilized counterparts. The expression levels of CBP, p300, HAT1, Dnmt1, and Dnmt3a in SCNT embryos treated with Scriptaid were significantly lower than the control group at the eight-cell stage (p<0.05), but the expression of HAT1 and Dnmt1a was higher than the control group at the blastocyst stage (p<0.05).

These results indicate that treatment of buffalo SCNT embryos with Scriptaid can improve their developmental competence, and this action is mediated by resulting in a similar histone acetylation level and global DNA methylation level compared to in vitro-fertilized embryos through regulating the expression pattern of genes related to histone acetylation and DNA methylation.",1.788,1477

The existence of a small population of stem-like tumor cells that efficiently propagate tumors and resist cytotoxic therapy is one proposed mechanism leading to the resilient behavior of tumor cells and poor prognosis. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the DNA methylation landscape in GBM-derived cancer stem cells (GSCs). Parallel comparisons of primary tumors and GSC lines derived from these tumors with normal controls (a neural stem cell (NSC) line and normal brain tissue) identified groups of hyper- and hypomethylated genes that display a trend of either increasing or decreasing methylation levels in the order of controls, primary GBMs, and their counterpart GSC lines, respectively. Interestingly, concurrent promoter hypermethylation and gene body hypomethylation were observed in a subset of genes including MGMT, AJAP1 and PTPRN2. These unique DNA methylation signatures were also found in primary GBM-derived xenograft tumors indicating that they are not tissue culture-related epigenetic changes. Integration of GSC-specific epigenetic signatures with gene expression analysis further identified candidate tumor suppressor genes that are frequently down-regulated in GBMs such as SPINT2, NEFM and PENK. Forced re-expression of SPINT2 reduced glioma cell proliferative capacity, anchorage independent growth, cell motility, and tumor sphere formation in vitro. The results from this study demonstrate that GSCs possess unique epigenetic signatures that may play important roles in the pathogenesis of GBM.",0.694,1444

However, it is becoming evident that the onset or development of breast cancer also depends on epigenetic factors, although the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of breast carcinomatous tissues and paired normal tissues to examine the differences in methylation between them. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to validate the hypermethylated genes screened out by DNA methylation microarray. We found that hypomethylation and hypermethylation occurred in 2753 and 1795 genes, respectively, in breast carcinomatous tissues. Meanwhile, gene ontology analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the function and pathway of several genes whose methylation status was altered in breast carcinomatous tissues. In addition, we investigated the promoter methylation status of four genes in breast carcinomatous tissue and paired normal tissues (n=30) by MSP. Promoter hypermethylation of CRABP1, HOXB13, IFNGR2, and PIK3C3 was found in 37% (11/30), 23% (7/30), 17% (5/30), and 2% (2/30) of the carcinomas, respectively. Mutation of these four important genes was critical to many types of cancer.

According to the results, half of the loci within this family show constant methylation patterns between the three cell types whereas the remaining half display variable levels of methylation. About half of the variably methylated IAP LTRs tend to be hypomethylated in ES cells, and nearly all in this group are hypomethylated in Neuro2A cells. The observed hypomethylation in both cell types occur in a non-uniform, locus-specific manner and to various degrees of severity, with some of them being easily detectible by COBRA. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of HT-TREBS to study DNA methylation changes at retrotransposons in a locus-specific manner in multiple cell types and further suggests the potential utility of this technique in developing epigenetic biomarkers for tracking disease progression.",2.284,1941

EGFR promoter methylation status and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive mutations in cervical cancer may be significant for clinical outcome prediction using anti-EGFR treatment. In this study, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive mutations, EGFR exons 18, 19, and 21 mutations, were detected by sequencing in a total of 293 Chinese cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples. EGFR promoter methylation status was detected by an EGFR asymmetric PCR and hybridization-fluorescence polarization assay and sequencing in 293 Chinese cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in 293 Chinese cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples were detected by an asymmetric GP5+/6+ PCR and hybridization-fluorescence polarization assay. No EGFR exons 18, 19, and 21 mutations were detected, EGFR promoter methylation status was identified in 98 samples, and HPV 16 infection was the first frequent HPV genotype. The methylated EGFR promoter was identified most frequently in cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples with HPV 16 infection (53.4%). Statistical significant difference of EGFR promoter methylation prevalence was found between HPV 16 and other HPV genotypes (P<0.01). This study suggested that there was no EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive mutation in EGFR exons 18, 19, and 21 in Chinese cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples. EGFR promoter methylation was common and it might be associated with HPV 16 infection in Chinese cervical squamous cell carcinoma.

During hrHPV-induced malignant transformation keratinocytes become able to grow anchorage independently, a tumorigenic trait at least partly associated with inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. We used hrHPV-containing keratinocytes to investigate the role of DNA methylation-mediated silencing of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the acquisition of anchorage independence.Anchorage dependent (n=11) and independent passages (n=19) of 4 hrHPV-immortalized keratinocyte cell lines were treated with 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC). Genome-wide miRNA expression profiles before and after treatment were compared to identify miRNAs silenced by methylation. Bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR showed increased methylation of hsa-mir-129-2/-137/-935/-3663/-3665 and -4281 in anchorage independent HPV-transformed keratinocytes and cervical cancer cell lines. Mature miRNAs derived from hsa-mir-129-2/-137/-3663 and -3665 showed functional relevance as they decreased anchorage independence in cervical cancer cell lines. Cervical (pre)cancerous lesions demonstrated increased methylation of hsa-mir-129-2/-935/-3663/-3665 and -4281, underlining the clinical relevance of our findings.In conclusion, methylation-mediated silencing of tumor suppressive miRNAs contributes to acquisition of an anchorage independent phenotype.

PTEN promoter methylation is a representative example of transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes. However, the effect of PTEN methylation on benzene-induced hematotoxicity has not yet been elucidated. In this study, the animal model of benzene hematotoxicity was successfully established. WBC significantly decreased in experimental groups (P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the weight of rats increased slowly and even declined with increasing doses of benzene in the benzene-treated groups. An increase in the level of PTEN methylation was observed in the low dose group, and PTEN methylation level increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. However, it was interesting that PTEN mRNA expression increased in the low dose group, but declined with increasing doses of benzene. The decrease of tumor suppressor function caused by PTEN methylation may be an important mechanism of benzene hematotoxicity. Furthermore, lymphoblast cell line F32 was incubated by benzene and then treated with 5-aza and TSA, alone or in combination. A dramatic decrease in the PTEN mRNA expression and a significant increase of PTEN methylation level in benzene-treated cells were also shown. PTEN mRNA expression was up regulated and PTEN methylation level was reduced by the epigenetic inhibitors, 5-aza and TSA. In conclusion, PTEN methylation is involved in benzene-induced hematotoxicity through suppressing PTEN mRNA expression.",2.706,1972

Here we examined whether maltreatment also alters bdnf DNA methylation in two additional regions known to be prominently affected by diverse forms of early life adversity in humans- the hippocampus and amygdala. We found significant bdnf DNA methylation modifications present within the adult hippocampus (dorsal and ventral) and amygdala (central/basolateral complex). We observed that the nature of change differed between sexes, gene locus (bdnf I vs. IV), and brain region. Furthermore, a manipulation that did not produce any obvious behavior difference in infants (brief and repeated experiences with a nurturing foster dam) also had long-term effects on methylation.

Patients with a response to dCRT have a better prognosis than those resistant to dCRT while survival benefits for patients with residual tumors are limited. Nevertheless, few molecular markers to predict the response to dCRT are currently available. Here, we aimed to establish a DNA methylation marker to predict the response to dCRT. METHODS: A total of 104 patients were divided into screening (n = 43) and validation (n = 61) sets. A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Methylation levels were measured by quantitative methylation-specific PCR and normalized by the fraction of cancer cells in a sample. RESULTS: The genome-wide methylation analysis of seven responders and eight non-responders identified 18 genomic regions specifically (un)methylated in the responders. Among these, methylation of the promoter CpG island of ZNF695 was significantly associated with the response to dCRT in the screening set (P = 0.004), and a cutoff value was determined. In the validation set, the association was successfully validated (P = 0.021), and a high specificity (90 %) for the prediction of responders was obtained using the prefixed cutoff value. In addition, a multivariate analysis showed that ZNF695 methylation was an independent predictive factor for the response to dCRT (OR 7.55, 95 % CI 2.12-26.9, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: ZNF695 methylation was significantly associated with the response to dCRT and is a promising predictive marker for the response to dCRT.",3.081,921

Hypermethylation of the inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) gene may play an important role in the initiation and development of MDS and AL. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess ID4 gene methylation in MDS and to establish if it could be an effective method of evaluating MDS disease progression. METHODS: We examined 142 bone marrow samples from MDS patients, healthy donors and MDS-AL patients using bisulfite sequencing PCR and quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR. The ID4 methylation rates and levels were assessed. RESULTS: ID4 methylation occurred in 27 patients (27/100). ID4 gene methylation was more frequent and at higher levels in patients with advanced disease stages and in high-risk subgroups according to WHO (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (P = 0.002, P = 0.007, respectively) classifications. ID4 methylation levels changed during disease progression. Both methylation rates and methylation levels were significantly different between healthy donor, MDS patients and patients with MDS-AL (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the level of ID4 methylation was an independent factor influencing overall survival. Patients with MDS showed decreased survival time with increased ID4 methylation levels (P = 0.011, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.371). Patients with ID4 methylation had shorter survival time than those without ID4 methylation (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ID4 gene methylation might be a new biomarker for MDS monitoring and the detection of minimal residual disease.",1.495,1042

DNA methylation patterns can also serve as potential biomarkers for disease progression and response to therapy. However, the full dynamics of DNA methylation across daily physiologic events have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: We sought to study how ingesting a standardized meal acutely affects peripheral blood DNA methylation. DESIGN: We performed an observational study in healthy men (n = 26) on DNA methylation and gene expression in whole blood before and 160 min after the ingestion of a standardized meal. Cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation was assayed on the HumanMethylation450k microarray, and gene expression was measured with the Human Gene 2.1 ST Array. RESULTS: Differential methylation after food intake was detected in 13% of the analyzed probes (63,207 CpG probes) at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). This effect was driven by changes in leukocyte fractions as estimated from comparisons against methylation datasets generated from sorted leukocytes. When methylation values were adjusted for estimated leukocyte fractions, 541 probes were observed to be altered in the postprandial state (5% FDR). CONCLUSIONS: Apparent alterations in DNA methylation 160 min after meal ingestion mainly reflect changes in the estimated leukocyte population in whole blood. These results have major methodologic implications for genome-wide methylation studies because they highlight the strong underlying effects of changes in leukocyte fractions on CpG methylation patterns as well as the potential importance of meal-standardized sampling procedures for future investigations when alterations in white blood cell fractions are unavailable.

Molecular confirmation is commonly performed on amniocytes. The possibility to use fresh (CVF) and cultured (CVC) chorionic villi has never been investigated. To verify whether CVF and CVC are reliable sources of DNA to study fetal methylation, we used pyrosequencing to test the methylation level of a number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at several imprinted loci (ICR1, ICR2, H19, PWS/AS-ICR, GNASXL, GNAS1A, ZAC/PLAGL1, and MEST) and at non-imprinted MGMT and RASSF1A promoters. We analyzed these regions in 19 healthy pregnancies and highlighted stable methylation levels between CVF and CVC at ICR1, ICR2, GNASXL, PWS/AS-ICR, and MEST. Conversely, the methylation levels at H19 promoter, GNAS1A and ZAC/PLAGL1 were different in CVC compared to fresh CV. We also investigated ICR1 and ICR2 methylation level of CVF/CVC of 2 BWS-suspected fetuses (P1 and P2). P1 showed ICR2 hypomethylation, P2 showed normal methylation at both ICR1 and ICR2. Our findings, although limited to one case of BWS fetus with an imprinting defect, can suggest that ICR1 and ICR2, but not H19, could be reliable targets for prenatal BWS diagnosis by methylation test in CVF and CVC. In addition, PWS/AS-ICR, GNASXL, and MEST, but not GNAS1A and ZAC/PLAGL1, are steadily hemimethylated in CV from healthy pregnancies, independently from culture. Thus, prenatal investigation of genomic imprinting in CV needs to be validated in a locus-specific manner.",4.78,826

In contrast, our current knowledge of the aberrant genomic DNA methylation in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) or other stromal cells that act as critical coconspirators of tumor progression is very scarce. To address this gap of knowledge, we conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on lung TAFs and paired control fibroblasts (CFs) from non-small cell lung cancer patients using the HumanMethylation450 microarray. We found widespread DNA hypomethylation concomitant with focal gain of DNA methylation in TAFs compared to CFs. The aberrant DNA methylation landscape of TAFs had a global impact on gene expression and a selective impact on the TGF-beta pathway. The latter included promoter hypermethylation-associated SMAD3 silencing, which was associated with hyperresponsiveness to exogenous TGF-beta1 in terms of contractility and extracellular matrix deposition. In turn, activation of CFs with exogenous TGF-beta1 partially mimicked the epigenetic alterations observed in TAFs, suggesting that TGF-beta1 may be necessary but not sufficient to elicit such alterations. Moreover, integrated pathway-enrichment analyses of the DNA methylation alterations revealed that a fraction of TAFs may be bone marrow-derived fibrocytes. Finally, survival analyses using DNA methylation and gene expression datasets identified aberrant DNA methylation on the EDARADD promoter sequence as a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our findings shed light on the unique origin and molecular alterations underlying the aberrant phenotype of lung TAFs, and identify a stromal biomarker with potential clinical relevance.",5.334,189

To evaluate if current hairdressers have elevated risks of adverse health effects, we measured several biomarkers related to cancer-related DNA alterations. We enrolled 295 hairdressers and 92 non-hairdressers (all female non-smokers) from Stockholm and southern Sweden. Questionnaire data were collected for each participant, including work tasks for the hairdressers. We measured telomere length in peripheral blood leucocytes using quantitative PCR and DNA methylation status of genes relevant for bladder cancer using methylation sensitive high resolution melting analysis. The hairdressers had shorter telomeres (beta = -0.069, P = 0.019) compared with non-hairdressers. Shorter telomeres were found in hairdressers up to 32 years old performing hair waving more than once per week as compared with hairdressers in the same age group performing hair waving less often (beta = -0.12, P = 0.037). Hair waving was associated with less frequent CDKN2A methylation (odds ratio, OR = 0.19, P = 0.033). Shorter telomeres in hairdressers may indicate a genotoxic effect. Performing hair waving was associated with short telomere length, although the effect was only observed in young hairdressers. No clear patterns were discerned with regard to DNA methylation of bladder cancer-related genes. The observed changes of methylation were not all in the expected direction and warrant further investigation.",2.63,340

In this study, we focused on another region of the RECK CpG island (a promoter/exon-1 region) and found an inverse correlation between its methylation and RECK-inducibility by an HDAC inhibitor, MS275, among a panel of breast cancer cell lines (n=15). In clinical samples (n=62), RECK intron-1 methylation was prevalent among luminal breast cancers as reported previously (26 of 38 cases; 68%) and particularly enriched in tumors of the ER+PR- subclass (10 of 10 cases) and of higher histological grades (Grade 2 and 3; 28 of 43 cases; P=0.006). In about a half of these cases, promoter/exon-1 methylation was absent, and hence, RECK may be inducible by certain drugs such as MS275.

However, conventional methylation studies have focused on the differences in the average levels between cell types while overlooking methylation heterogeneity within cell types. Little information has been uncovered using recent single-cell methods because of either technical limitations or the great labor required to process many single cells. Here, we report the highly efficient detection of cell-to-cell DNA methylation variability in liver tissue, based on comparing the methylation status of adjacent CpG sites on long sequencing reads. This method provides abundant methylation linkage information and enables genome-wide estimation of cell-to-cell variability. We observed repressed methylation variability in hypomethylated regions compared with the variability in hypomethylated regions across the genome, which we confirmed using public human sperm data. A gradual change in methylation status at the boundaries of hypomethylated regions was observed for the first time.

Yet, it remains undetermined whether hypoxia had a direct effect and if DNA methylation played a causal role in hypoxia-mediated ER-alpha gene repression. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that prolonged hypoxia has a direct effect and increases promoter methylation resulting in ER-alpha gene repression and inhibition of estrogen-mediated adaptation of uterine vascular tone. Uterine arteries isolated from nonpregnant and pregnant sheep were treated ex vivo with 21.0% O2 and 10.5% O2 for 48 hours. Hypoxia significantly increased ER-alpha promoter methylation at both specificity protein-1 and upstream stimulatory factor binding sites, decreased specificity protein-1 and upstream stimulatory factor binding to the promoter, and suppressed ER-alpha expression in uterine arteries of pregnant animals. Of importance, the effects of hypoxia were blocked by a methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In addition, hypoxia abrogated steroid hormone-mediated increase in ER-alpha expression and inhibited the hormone-induced increase in large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity and decrease in myogenic tone in uterine arteries of nonpregnant animals, which were reversed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The results provide novel evidence of a direct effect of hypoxia on heightened promoter methylation that plays a causal role in ER-alpha gene repression and ablation of steroid hormone-mediated adaptation of uterine arterial large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity and myogenic tone in pregnancy.",0,412

Similarly, in the MSAP experiment, the MSAP% and number of demethylated-type bands were unchanged after Cd treatment, but the number of methylated-type bands was increased significantly in the 5.0-mg/L Cd(2+) treatment group, a finding that may be associated with the AFLP results. The polymorphic bands were also sequenced and the functions of their homologous genes were determined. The DNA damage and methylation changes may be the primary cause of certain pathology changes as a result of Cd uptake in plants.",3.359,330

The aim of the present study was to identify novel methylation markers for the prediction of patient outcomes using microarray analysis of DNA methylation in samples from long-term follow-up patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Candidate methylation markers were selected from our previously published genome-wide methylation profiles. The clinical relevance of candidate methylation markers was determined by quantitative pyrosequencing analysis of 136 human bladder specimens (8 normal controls and 128 NMIBCs). The reversibility of DNA methylation was examined by 5-Aza-CdR treatment in human bladder cancer cell lines. The methylation patterns of candidate markers were significantly associated with aggressive clinicopathological features. In multivariate regression analysis, hypermethylation of radial spoke head 9 homolog (RSPH9) was an independent predictor of disease recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.02; P=0.001) and progression (hazard ratio, 8.25; P=0.028). The methylation level of RSPH9 decreased with 5-Aza-CdR treatment and progressively increased in its absence in bladder cancer cell lines. RSPH9 methylation is an independent prognostic indicator in NMIBC patients, and could be of value for the assessment of disease recurrence and progression and for clinical decision-making regarding treatment.",2.301,1569

The rice introgression line IL177-103 and its recurrent parent IR64, which show contrasting salt stress tolerance, were used to characterize DNA methylation changes under salt stress and subsequent recovery using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis. The introgression line IL177-103 showed significantly improved tolerance to salinity, as represented by higher relative water content, endogenous abscisic acid content, activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes, and lower Na(+) concentration in shoots, compared with IR64. The MSAP results showed that less than 10.5% of detected DNA methylation sites were genotype specific, in line with their similar genetic background. Salt-induced DNA methylation changes in both genotypes were mostly detected in roots, and the major portion of the salt-induced DNA demethylation/methylation alterations remained even after recovery, implying their inheritance in the present generation. Furthermore, a few sites with stable DNA methylation differences were identified between salt-tolerant IL177-103 and salt-sensitive IR64, thus providing genotype-specific epigenetic markers. Collectively, these results provide valuable data for further dissection of the molecular mechanisms of salt-stress response and tolerance in rice.",2.297,152

Preterm birth can lead to increased mortality risk and poor life-long health and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Whether environmental risk factors affect preterm birth through epigenetic phenomena is largely unstudied. We sought to determine whether preterm risk factors, such as smoke exposure and education, were associated with cervical DNA methylation in the prostaglandin E receptor 2 gene (PTGER2) and a repetitive element, long interspersed nuclear element-1 Homo sapiens-specific (LINE 1-HS). Second, we aimed to determine whether mid-pregnancy DNA methylation of these regions in cervical samples could predict the length of gestation. We obtained a cervical swab between 16-19 weeks gestation from 80 women participating in a Mexico City birth cohort, used pyrosequencing to analyze DNA methylation of PTGER2 and LINE 1-HS, and examined associations with maternal covariates. We used accelerated failure time models to analyze associations of DNA methylation with the length of gestation. DNA methylation of both sequences was associated with Pap smear inflammation. LINE 1-HS methylation was associated with smoke exposure, BMI and parity. In adjusted models, gestations were 3.3 days longer (95%CI 0.6, 6.0) for each interquartile range of PTGER2 DNA methylation. Higher LINE 1-HS methylation was associated with shorter gestations (-3.3 days, 95%CI -6.5, -0.2). In conclusion, cervical DNA methylation was associated with risk factors for preterm birth and the length of gestation.",4.78,1581

METHODS: Samples of oral epithelial cells were collected using mouthwash from a population of former and current smokers and those who had never smoked. Genomic DNA was extracted, and global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation was performed using an ELISA-based technique; DNA methylation at specific sites was performed using Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) (KRT14, miR-9-3 and miR-137) or Methylation-Sensitive Restriction Enzymes (MSRE) (KRT19). K14 and K19 protein expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Higher levels of global DNA methylation were found in current smokers with over 15 years of consumption (p=0.04), but no differences were found in relation to global DNA hydroxymethylation. No differences in global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels were found in relation to age or gender. Global DNA methylation was higher than the hydroxymethylation level (p<0.001) but they were not correlated in the oral mucosa. For specific sites, miR-9-3 hypomethylation was detected in current smokers (p<0.001). Additional analysis showed no difference in the methylation status when age, gender, period of consumption or amount of cigarettes were considered for any of the studied genes. K19 expression was higher in current smokers in comparison to former smokers and those who had never smoked (p<0.05).

The goal of our study is to investigate the association between CMTM3 promoter methylation and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the bisulfite pyrosequencing technology, DNA methylation levels of seven CpG sites in CMTM3 promoter are measured in tumor tissues and their adjacent tissues of 76 male LSCC patients. RESULTS: Our results reveal a significantly elevated promoter methylation of CMTM3 in tumor tissues compared with their adjacent tissues (P<0.001). A breakdown analysis by age shows that significant association of CMTM3 promoter methylation with cancer risk is specific to the LSCC patients older than 55years (P<0.001) but not in the younger patients (P=0.305). Moreover, the association is only observed in the LSCC patients with smoking behavior (P=0.001). Breakdown analysis also shows that CMTM3 promoter methylation is associated with cancer risk among patients with stage I LSCC (P<0.001).

Anogenital distance (AGD) was measured at postnatal day (PND) 21. Clinical signs, body weights, feed and water consumption, organs weights, serum hormone values, and H19 methylation level of organ and sperm were measured at PND63. Body weights were significantly lower than control until PND6. AGD was significantly decreased in the CPM100 group in males and increased in the CPM20 group in females. The absolute weights of the thymus and epididymis were significantly increased for males in all of CPM treatment groups. In the CPM20 group, absolute weights of liver, kidney, heart, lung, spleen, prostate gland, and testes were significantly increased. Testosterone concentrations in serum were significantly increased by CPM treatment in males. H19 methylation level of liver and thymus showed decreased pattern in a dose-dependent manner in males.

25467068,Fine-tuning of histone H3 Lys4 methylation during pseudohyphal differentiation by the CDK submodule of RNA polymerase II.,"['Law MJ', 'Ciccaglione K']",Genetics,2015,"Transcriptional regulation is dependent upon the interactions between the RNA pol II holoenzyme complex and chromatin. RNA pol II is part of a highly conserved multiprotein complex that includes the core mediator and CDK8 subcomplex. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CDK8 subcomplex, composed of Ssn2p, Ssn3p, Ssn8p, and Srb8p, is thought to play important roles in mediating transcriptional control of stress-responsive genes. Also central to transcriptional control are histone post-translational modifications. Lysine methylation, dynamically balanced by lysine methyltransferases and demethylases, has been intensively studied, uncovering significant functions in transcriptional control. A key question remains in understanding how these enzymes are targeted during stress response. To determine the relationship between lysine methylation, the CDK8 complex, and transcriptional control, we performed phenotype analyses of yeast lacking known lysine methyltransferases or demethylases in isolation or in tandem with SSN8 deletions. We show that the RNA pol II CDK8 submodule components SSN8/SSN3 and the histone demethylase JHD2 are required to inhibit pseudohyphal growth-a differentiation pathway induced during nutrient limitation-under rich conditions. Yeast lacking both SSN8 and JHD2 constitutively express FLO11, a major regulator of pseudohyphal growth. Interestingly, deleting known FLO11 activators including FLO8, MSS11, MFG1, TEC1, SNF1, KSS1, and GCN4 results in a range of phenotypic suppression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SSN8 inhibits H3 Lys4 trimethylation independently of JHD2 at the FLO11 locus, suggesting that H3 Lys4 hypermethylation is locking FLO11 into a transcriptionally active state. These studies implicate the CDK8 subcomplex in fine-tuning H3 Lys4 methylation levels during pseudohyphal differentiation.",5.963,392

METHODS: Fetal, placental, and ovarian tissue were collected on d16.5 of pregnancy from young (4-5 weeks) and aged (15 months) mice. Uterine tissue and in vivo matured oocytes were collected from non-pregnant females. Methylation of imprinted genes was determined by restriction enzyme based assays, and transcript abundance of imprinted and nutrient supply genes were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Maternal age was associated with fetal growth restriction and placental overgrowth. In maternally aged mice, methylation was minimally dysregulated in fetal tissue, while placental tissue showed aberrant methylation and transcript abundance of imprinted genes. Ovarian methylation and gene expression was severely dysregulated, although oocyte gene expression was only minimally altered. Abundance of Kcnq1 transcripts was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in oocytes obtained from aged females compared to young females. Gene expression was also severely dysregulated in the uterus, including nutrient transport genes. CONCLUSION: Fetal and placental growth abnormalities correspond to aberrant methylation and gene expression in reproductive tissues from maternally aged mice. Significant alterations in gene expression and methylation in the aged ovary suggests that the follicular environment may be compromised. Aberrant methylation and expression of imprinted genes in the aged uterus may contribute to reduced implantation. Maternal age negatively affects imprinted gene methylation and expression in both germ cells and somatic cells of the reproductive tract, contributing to the reduced fertility observed with advanced maternal age.",1.718,620

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a component of the Polycomb machinery, is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3). Jarid2 was previously identified as a cofactor of PRC2, regulating PRC2 targeting to chromatin and its enzymatic activity. Deletion of Jarid2 leads to impaired orchestration of gene expression during cell lineage commitment. Here, we reveal an unexpected crosstalk between Jarid2 and PRC2, with Jarid2 being methylated by PRC2. This modification is recognized by the Eed core component of PRC2 and triggers an allosteric activation of PRC2's enzymatic activity. We show that Jarid2 methylation is important to promote PRC2 activity at a locus devoid of H3K27me3 and for the correct deposition of this mark during cell differentiation. Our results uncover a regulation loop where Jarid2 methylation fine-tunes PRC2 activity depending on the chromatin context.",14.018,1063

Computational prediction of CpG site-specific methylation levels is critical to enable genome-wide analyses, but current approaches tackle average methylation within a locus and are often limited to specific genomic regions. RESULTS: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, and show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions solely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest classifier to predict methylation levels at CpG site resolution using features including neighboring CpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, co-localization with coding regions, CpG islands (CGIs), and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project. Our approach achieves 92% prediction accuracy of genome-wide methylation levels at single-CpG-site precision. The accuracy increases to 98% when restricted to CpG sites within CGIs and is robust across platform and cell-type heterogeneity. Our classifier outperforms other types of classifiers and identifies features that contribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation, CGIs, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, transcription factor binding sites, and histone modifications were found to be most predictive of methylation levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations of DNA methylation patterns led us to develop a classifier to predict DNA methylation levels at CpG site resolution with high accuracy. Furthermore, our method identified genomic features that interact with DNA methylation, suggesting mechanisms involved in DNA methylation modification and regulation, and linking diverse epigenetic processes.",10.81,1174

For this project, a multiplex methylation SNaPshot reaction composed of seven CpG markers was used for the identification of 4 body fluids, including blood, saliva, semen and vaginal fluid. A total of 30 specimens were prepared and distributed to participating laboratories after thorough testing. The required experiments included four increasingly complex tasks: 1) capillary electrophoresis of a purified single-base extension reaction product, 2) multiplex PCR of bisulfite-modified DNA, 3) bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA and 4) extraction of genomic DNA from body fluid samples. In tasks 2, 3 and 4, one or more mixtures were analyzed, and specimens containing both known and unknown body fluid sources were used. Six of the laboratories generated consistent body fluid typing results for specimens of bisulfite converted DNA and genomic DNA. One laboratory failed to set up appropriate conditions for capillary analysis of reference single-base extension products. In general, variation in the values obtained for DNA methylation analysis between laboratories increased with the complexity of the required experiments. However, all laboratories concurred on the interpretation of the DNA methylation profiles produced.

While humans (consumers/workers) are primarily at risk of being exposed to the adverse effect of nanoparticles, the effect on plants and other components of the environment cannot be ignored. The present work investigates the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and epigenetic (DNA methylation) effect of MWCNT on the plant system- Allium cepa. MWCNT uptake in root cells significantly altered cellular morphology. Membrane integrity and mitochondrial function were also compromised. The nanotubes induced significant DNA damage, micronucleus formation and chromosome aberration. DNA laddering assay revealed the formation of internucleosomal fragments, which is indicative of apoptotic cell death. This finding was confirmed by an accumulation of cells in the sub-G0 phase of the cell cycle. An increase in CpG methylation was observed using the isoschizomers MspI/HpaII. HPLC analysis of DNA samples revealed a significant increase in the levels of 5-methyl-deoxy-cytidine (5mdC).

This study aims to explore the DNA methylation pattern of the folate transporter genes FOLR1, PCFT, and RFC1 as well as the corresponding protein expressions in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue and adjacent non-cancerous mucosa (ANCM). Our results showed statistically significant differences in the DNA-methylated fraction of all three genes at several gene regions; we identified three differentially methylated CpG sites in the FOLR1 gene, five CpG sites in the PCFT gene, and six CpG sites in the RFC1 gene. There was a pronounced expression of the FRalpha and RFC proteins in both the CRC and ANCM tissues, though the expression was attenuated in cancer compared to the paired ANCM tissues. The PCFT protein was undetectable or expressed at a very low level in both tissue types. Higher methylated fractions of the CpG sites 3-5 in the RFC1 gene were associated with a lower protein expression, suggestive of epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation of the RFC1 gene in the colorectal cancer. Our results did not show any association between the RFC and FRalpha protein expression and tumor stage, TNM classification, or tumor location. In conclusion, this is the first study to simultaneously evaluate both DNA methylation and protein expression of all three folate transporter genes, FOLR1, PCFT, and RFC1, in colorectal cancer.

Epigenetics has recently been shown to contribute to a number of complex diseases and traits, including measures of cognitive function and preclinical neurodegenerative disease. We sought to determine whether changes in DNA methylation existed between farmworker and non-farmworker populations and to identify the genes most likely involved in those changes. METHODS: Eighty-three farmworkers and 60 non-farmworkers were selected from PACE4, a community-based, participatory research project comparing occupational exposures between immigrant Latino farmworker and non-farmworker manual workers. Measurements of DNA methylation were performed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, at the beginning and end of the 2012 growing season. Bonferroni adjustment was used to identify significant findings (p = 1.03 x 10-7, based on 485,000 tested methylation sites), although less stringent criteria (i.e., p </= 1 x 10-6) were used to identify sites of interest. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) databases were used to help identify the most likely functional genes for each associated methylation site. RESULTS: Methylation at 36 CpG sites, located in or near 72 genes, differed between the two groups (p </= 1 x 10-6). The difference between the two groups was generally due to an increase in methylation in the farmworkers and a slight decrease in methylation in the non-farmworkers. Enrichment was observed in several biological pathways, including those involved in the immune response, as well as growth hormone signaling, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, p70S6K signaling, and PI3K signaling in B lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified considerable changes in DNA methylation at 36 CpG sites over the growing season that differed between farmworkers and non-farmworkers. Dominant pathways included immune-related (HLA) processes, as well as a number of diverse biological systems. Further studies are necessary to determine which exposures or behaviors are responsible for the observed changes, and whether these changes eventually lead to disease-related phenotypes in this population.",2.196,631

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a key orchestrator in energy homeostasis. We hypothesized that CG-IUGR programed an insulin-resistant phenotype through the alteration in DNA methylation and transcriptional activity of PGC-1alpha. METHODS: A CG-IUGR rat model was adopted using maternal gestational nutritional restriction followed by infantile overnutrition achieved by reducing the litter size. The DNA methylation was determined by pyrosequencing. The mRNA expression and mitochondrial content were assessed by real-time PCR. The insulin-signaling protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the CG-IUGR rats showed an increase in the DNA methylation of specific CpG sites in PGC-1alpha, and a decrease in the transcriptional activity of PGC-1alpha, mitochondrial content, protein level of PI3K and phosphorylated-Akt2 in liver and muscle tissues. The methylation of specific CpG sites in PGC-1alpha was positively correlated with fasting insulin concentration. CONCLUSION: IUGR followed by infantile overnutrition programs an insulin-resistant phenotype, possibly through the alteration in DNA methylation and transcriptional activity of PGC-1alpha.

The clinical relevance of PRAC methylation was determined in 136 human bladder specimens (eight normal controls [NCs] and 128 primary NMIBCs) using quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. PRAC methylation was significantly higher in NMIBC patients than in NCs and was significantly associated with higher grade and more advanced stage of cancer. Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed significant difference in tumor recurrence and progression according to PRAC methylation status (both p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the PRAC methylation status was a strong predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.652; p = 0.012) and progression (HR, 9.531; p = 0.035) of NMIBC.

To date, the mechanisms by which methylation biases the binding affinities of proteins to DNA are not fully understood; however, it has been proposed that changes in double-strand conformations, such as stretching, bending, and over-twisting, as well as local variations in DNA stiffness/flexibility may play a role. The present work investigates, at the single molecule level, the morphological consequences of DNA methylation in vitro. By tracking the atomic force microscopy images of single DNA molecules, we characterize DNA conformations pertaining to two different degrees of methylation. In particular, we observe that methylation induces no relevant variations in DNA contour lengths, but produces measurable incremental changes in persistence lengths. Furthermore, we observe that for the methylated chains, the statistical distribution of angles along the DNA coordinate length is characterized by a double exponential decay, in agreement with what is predicted for polyelectrolytes. The results reported herein support the claim that the biological consequences of the methylation process, specifically difficulties in protein-DNA binding, are at least partially due to DNA conformation modifications.",4.381,83

 States of America",2015,"DNA methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation and genome defense conserved in many eukaryotic organisms. In Arabidopsis, the DNA methyltransferase domains rearranged methylase 2 (DRM2) controls RNA-directed DNA methylation in a pathway that also involves the plant-specific RNA Polymerase V (Pol V). Additionally, the Arabidopsis genome encodes an evolutionarily conserved but catalytically inactive DNA methyltransferase, DRM3. Here, we show that DRM3 has moderate effects on global DNA methylation and small RNA abundance and that DRM3 physically interacts with Pol V. In Arabidopsis drm3 mutants, we observe a lower level of Pol V-dependent noncoding RNA transcripts even though Pol V chromatin occupancy is increased at many sites in the genome. These findings suggest that DRM3 acts to promote Pol V transcriptional elongation or assist in the stabilization of Pol V transcripts. This work sheds further light on the mechanism by which long noncoding RNAs facilitate RNA-directed DNA methylation.",9.674,1770

It has also been proposed to modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in the interactome. To investigate the effect of PTMs on PPIs, we recently developed the conditional two-hybrid (C2H) system. With this, we demonstrated that arginine methylation can modulate PPIs in the yeast interactome. Here, we used the C2H system to investigate the effect of lysine methylation. Specifically, we asked whether Ctm1p-mediated trimethylation of yeast cytochrome c Cyc1p, on lysine 78, modulates its interactions with Erv1p, Ccp1p, Cyc2p and Cyc3p. We show that the interactions between Cyc1p and Erv1p, and between Cyc1p and Cyc3p, are significantly increased upon trimethylation of lysine 78. This increase of interaction helps explain the reported facilitation of Cyc1p import into the mitochondrial intermembrane space upon methylation. This first application of the C2H system to the study of methyllysine-modulated interactions further confirms its robustness and flexibility.",3.807,70

Although it has been shown that ethanol-induced damage in hepatocytes resulted from a change in methionine metabolism causes global gene expression changes in hepatocytes, the role of the epigenetic machinery in such processes has, however, been barely investigated. 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are major molecules of epigenetic DNA modification that play an important role in the control of gene expression. Using antibodies against 5mC and 5hmC, the DNA methylation in patients with AH was examined by immunohistochemistry and quantified by morphometric image analysis. The immunoreactivity intensity of 5mC in patients with AH was significantly higher than that seen in normal controls. While there was a trend of decreased 5-hmC in patients with AH, the difference between patients with AH and normal control was not significant. Our study suggests that aberrant DNA-methylation is associated with pathogenesis of AH.",2.706,1793

However, the regulatory mechanism of SCN3A expression under epileptic condition is still unknown. Here we showed a high level of Scn3a mRNA expression in mouse embryonic hippocampus with gradually decreasing to a low level during the postnatal development and a methylation of a specific CpG site (-39C) in the Scn3a promoter was increased in hippocampus during postnatal development, corresponding to the downregulation of Scn3a expression. Furthermore, in vitro methylation and -39C>T mutation of the Scn3a promoter decreased the reporter gene expression, suggesting an important role of the -39C site in regulating gene expression. We then demonstrated that the sequence containing -39C was a MBD2-binding motif and the CpG methylation of the promoter region increased the capability of MBD2's binding to the motif. Knockdown of MBD2 in mouse N1E-115 cells led to the -39C methylation and the downregulation of Scn3a transcription by decreasing the Scn3a promoter activity. In the hippocampus of seizure mice, the expressions of Scn3a and Mbd2 were upregulated after 10-day KA treatment. At the same time point, the -39C site was demethylated and the capability of MBD2's binding to the Scn3a promoter motif was decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that CpG methylation and MBD2 are involved in altering Scn3a expression during postnatal development and seizure condition.",4.381,1226

However, there are few reliable biomarkers to predict the clinical response to anti-EGFR treatment. We investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation status in metastatic colorectal cancer to identify associations between the methylation status and clinical response to anti-EGFR antibody. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 97 patients (45 patients for the first cohort and 52 patients for the second cohort) who received anti-EGFR treatment for KRAS wild-type metastatic CRC. Then we analyzed the associations between genome-wide DNA methylation status and clinical response to anti-EGFR treatment, and evaluated the predictive power and value of the methylation status statistically. As a result, each cohort was classified into highly methylated CRC and low methylated CRC subgroups by unsupervised clustering analyses. In the first cohort, clinical outcomes were significantly better in the low methylated CRC subgroup than in the highly methylated CRC subgroup (response rate, 35.7% vs 6.3%, P = 0.03; disease control rate, 75% vs 31.3%, P = 0.005; hazard ratio for progression-free survival, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.57, P < 0.001; overall survival, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.54, P < 0.001). These results were reproducible in the second cohort. The genome-wide methylation status was a predictive factor of progression-free survival and overall survival independently of RAS mutation status. In conclusion, we found that the genome-wide DNA methylation status is a powerful epigenetic predictor of anti-EGFR treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (UMIN000005490).",3.523,117

Our aim is to identify methylation tumour markers that have a predictive value for the presence of regional lymph node metastases in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OOSCC). Significantly differentially expressed genes were retrieved from four reported microarray expression profiles comparing pN0 and pN+ head-neck tumours, and one expression array identifying functionally hypermethylated genes. Additional metastasis-associated genes were included from the literature. Thus genes were selected that influence the development of nodal metastases and might be regulated by methylation. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) primers were designed and tested on 8 head-neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and technically validated on 10 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) OOSCC cases. Predictive value was assessed in a clinical series of 70 FFPE OOSCC with pathologically determined nodal status. Five out of 28 methylation markers (OCLN, CDKN2A, MGMT, MLH1 and DAPK1) were frequently differentially methylated in OOSCC. Of these, MGMT methylation was associated with pN0 status (P = 0.02) and with lower immunoexpression (P = 0.02). DAPK1 methylation was associated with pN+ status (P = 0.008) but did not associate with protein expression. In conclusion, out of 28 candidate genes, two (7%) showed a predictive value for the pN status. Both genes, DAPK1 and MGMT, have predictive value for nodal metastasis in a clinical group of OOSCC. Therefore DNA methylation markers are capable of contributing to diagnosis and treatment selection in OOSCC.

In affected individuals, the CGG repeat expansion leads to hypermethylation and the gene is transcriptionally inactive. Our aim was to identify fragile X syndrome among children with intellectual disability in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 63 patients (53 males, 10 females) presented with intellectual disability, 29 normal subjects, and 23 other family members. DNA samples from six patients previously diagnosed with fragile X syndrome by Southern blot technique were used as positive controls. The method was based on bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by two different techniques. The first technique applied polymerase chain reaction amplification using one set of primers specific for amplifying methylated CpG dinucleotide region; another set designed to amplify the unmethylated CGG repeats. The second technique used the methylation-specific melting curve analysis for detection of methylation status of the FMR1 promoter region. RESULTS: Molecular testing using methylation sensitive polymerase chain reaction had shown amplified products in all normal subjects using unmethylated but not methylated primers indicating normal alleles, whereas amplified products were obtained using methylated polymerase chain reaction primers in fragile X syndrome-positive samples and in 9 of 53 males, indicating affected individuals. Molecular testing using melting curve analysis has shown a single low melting peak in all normal males and in (44/53) patients indicating unmethylated FMR1 gene, whereas high melting peak indicating methylated gene was observed in the fragile X syndrome-positive samples and in 9 of 53 patients. We found 100% concordance between results of both techniques and the results of Southern blot analysis. Three samples have shown both methylated and unmethylated alleles, indicating possible mosaicism. No female patients or carriers could be detected by both techniques. CONCLUSION: The technique can be applied for the rapid screening for fragile X syndrome among patients with intellectual disability. The impact of mosaicism on clinical severity needs further investigation.",1.695,1031

Here, we discovered that loss of H3K4 methylation due to depletion of the methyltransferase Set1p (or the two COMPASS subunits Spp1p and Bre2p, respectively) leads to enhanced cell death during chronological aging and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induction. In contrast, loss of H3K79 methylation due to DOT1 disruption only slightly affects yeast survival. SET1 depleted cells accumulate DNA damage and co-disruption of Dot1p, the DNA damage adaptor protein Rad9p, the endonuclease Nuc1p, and the metacaspase Yca1p, respectively, impedes their early death. Furthermore, aged and dying wild-type cells lose H3K4 methylation, whereas depletion of the H3K4 demethylase Jhd2p improves survival, indicating that loss of H3K4 methylation is an important trigger for cell death in S. cerevisiae. Given the evolutionary conservation of H3K4 methylation this likely plays a role in apoptosis regulation in a wide range of organisms.",7.528,1684

Posttranslational modifications of the NICD are important for its transcriptional activity and protein turnover. Deregulation of Notch signaling and stabilizing mutations of Notch1 have been linked to leukemia development. We found that the methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; also known as PRMT4) methylated NICD at five conserved arginine residues within the C-terminal transactivation domain. CARM1 physically and functionally interacted with the NICD-coactivator complex and was found at gene enhancers in a Notch-dependent manner. Although a methylation-defective NICD mutant was biochemically more stable, this mutant was biologically less active as measured with Notch assays in embryos of Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the expression of PAD4 mRNA in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) from 60 RA patients and 40 healthy individuals. Asymmetric di-methylation of histone H3R17, symmetric di-methylation and mono-methylation of H4R3 were semi-quantified by Western blotting in 12 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), 26 patients with RA and 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: PAD4 mRNA in RA was significantly higher than that in healthy controls[34.6(16.7, 70.8) vs 20.6(11.1, 51.8), P < 0.05]. The level of histone H3R17 asymmetric di-methylation in RA was significantly higher than that of OA or control groups (71.34 +/- 25.65 vs 37.18 +/- 18.62 vs 50.67 +/- 13.99, P < 0.01) , which was positively related to Tender joint count and Swollen joint count in 28 joints (r = 0.418, P = 0.034;r = 0.402, P = 0.042). The level of histone H4R3 symmetric di-methylation was similar in RA,OA and control groups (75.02 +/- 20.35 vs 57.92 +/- 22.77 vs 68.37 +/- 17.57, P > 0.05) . The level of histone H4R3 mono-methylation in RA patients was significantly lower than that of OA patients and healthy individuals (11.24 +/- 7.81 vs 32.77 +/- 30.77 vs 51.20 +/- 47.14, P < 0.05). The level of histone H4R3 mono-methylation in RA patients was negatively correlated to PAD4 (r = -0.643, P < 0.01) .

CONCLUSIONS: The level of histone H3R17 asymmetric di-methylation is significantly higher and the level of histone H4R3 mono-methylation is significantly lower in RA patients comparing with OA and control groups.

We recently showed that DNA methylation at the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-32 (IL32) is reduced in JIA CD4+ T cells. To extend this finding, we measured IL32 methylation in CD4+ T-cells from an additional sample of JIA cases and age- and sex-matched controls, and found a reduction in methylation associated with JIA consistent with the prior data (combined case-control dataset: 25.0% vs 37.7%, p = 0.0045). Further, JIA was associated with reduced IL32 methylation in CD8+ T cells (15.2% vs 25.5%, p = 0.034), suggesting disease-associated changes to a T cell precursor. Additionally, we measured regional SNPs, along with CD4+ T cell expression of total IL32, and the gamma and beta isoforms. Several SNPs were associated with methylation. Two SNPs were also associated with JIA, and we found evidence of interaction such that methylation was only associated with JIA in minor allele carriers (e.g. rs10431961 p(interaction) = 0.011). Methylation at one measured CpG was inversely correlated with total IL32 expression (Spearman r = -0.73, p = 0.0009), but this was not a JIA-associated CpG. Overall, our data further confirms that reduced IL32 methylation is associated with JIA, and that SNPs play an interactive role.",5.578,542

In this study, the dynamic activity of the Gal4/UAS system was monitored in zebrafish throughout the entire lifespan and during germline transmission, using an optimized Gal4/UAS, KalTA4/4xUAS, which is driven by two muscle-specific regulatory sequences. We found that UAS-linked gene expression was transcriptionally amplified by Gal4/UAS during early developmental stages and that the amplification effects tended to weaken during later stages and even disappear in subsequent generations. In the F2 generation, the transcription of a UAS-linked enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter was transcriptionally silent from 16 days post-fertilization (dpf) into adulthood, yet offspring of this generation showed reactivation of the EGFP reporter in some strains. We further show that the transcriptional silencing and reactivation of UAS-driven EGFP correlated with the DNA methylation levels of the UAS regulatory sequences. Notably, asymmetric DNA methylation of the 4xUAS occurred in oocytes and sperm. Moreover, the paternal and maternal 4xUAS sequences underwent different DNA methylation dynamics after fertilization. Our study suggests that the Gal4/UAS system may represent a powerful tool for tracing the DNA methylation dynamics of paternal and maternal loci during zebrafish development and that UAS-specific DNA methylation should be seriously considered when the Gal4/UAS system is applied in zebrafish.",3.269,769

Radiation-induced changes in cardiac DNA methylation associated with repetitive elements were detected. Specifically, modest hypomethylation of retrotransposon LINE-1 was observed at day 7 after irradiation with either protons or (56)Fe. This was followed by LINE-1, and other retrotransposons, ERV2 and SINE B1, as well as major satellite DNA hypermethylation at day 90 after irradiation with (56)Fe. These changes in DNA methylation were accompanied by alterations in the expression of DNA methylation machinery and affected the one-carbon metabolism pathway. Furthermore, loss of transposable elements expression was detected in the cardiac tissue at the 90-day time-point, paralleled by substantial accumulation of mRNA transcripts, associated with major satellites. Given that the one-carbon metabolism pathway can be modulated by dietary modifications, these findings suggest a potential strategy for the mitigation and, possibly, prevention of the negative effects exerted by ionizing radiation on the cardiovascular system.

DNA methylation, one such form of epigenetic information, has been implicated in the regulation of gene function in diverse metazoan taxa. In insects, DNA methylation has been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and splicing. However, the functional basis for this role remains relatively poorly understood, and other epigenetic systems likely interact with DNA methylation to affect gene expression. We investigated associations between DNA methylation and histone modifications in the genome of the ant Camponotus floridanus in order to provide insight into how different epigenetic systems interact to affect gene function. We found that many histone modifications are strongly predictive of DNA methylation levels in genes, and that these epigenetic signals are more predictive of gene expression when considered together than when considered independently. We also found that peaks of DNA methylation are associated with the spatial organization of chromatin within active genes. Finally, we compared patterns of differential histone modification enrichment to patterns of differential DNA methylation to reveal that several histone modifications significantly covary with DNA methylation between C. floridanus phenotypes. As the first genomic comparison of DNA methylation to histone modifications within a single insect taxon, our investigation provides new insight into the regulatory significance of DNA methylation.",4.229,658

Although hyperphosphorylation of tau serine and threonine residues is an established trigger of tau misfunction and aggregation, tau modifications extend to lysine residues as well, raising the possibility that different modification signatures depress or promote aggregation propensity depending on site occupancy. To identify lysine residue modifications associated with normal tau function, soluble tau proteins isolated from four cognitively normal human brains were characterized by MS methods. The major detectable lysine modification was found to be methylation, which appeared in the form of mono- and di-methyl lysine residues distributed among at least 11 sites. Unlike tau phosphorylation sites, the frequency of lysine methylation was highest in the microtubule-binding repeat region that mediates both microtubule binding and homotypic interactions. When purified recombinant human tau was modified in vitro through reductive methylation, its ability to promote tubulin polymerization was retained, whereas its aggregation propensity was greatly attenuated at both nucleation and extension steps. These data establish lysine methylation as part of the normal tau post-translational modification signature in human brain, and suggest that it can function in part to protect against pathological tau aggregation.",0,1531

The current study was set out to assess the performance of CADM1, MAL and miR124-2 methylation analysis in cervical scrapes for detection of cervical and endometrial cancer. METHODS: A series of cervical scrapes of women with cervical (n=79) or endometrial (n=21) cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) (n=16) or CIN2 (n=32), and women without evidence of CIN2 or worse (n=120) were assessed for methylation of CADM1, MAL and miR124-2.

RESULTS: All samples of women with cervical cancer (79/79, 100%), independent of the histotype, and 76% (16/21; 95% CI 58.0% to 94.4%) of women with endometrial cancer scored positive for DNA methylation for at least one of the three genes. In women without cancer, methylation frequencies increased significantly with severity of disease from 19.2% (23/120; 95% CI 12.1% to 26.2%) in women without CIN2 or worse to 37.5% (12/32; 95% CI 20.7% to 54.3%) and 68.8% (11/16; 95% CI 46.0% to 91.5%) in women with CIN2 and CIN3, respectively. Overall methylation positivity and the number of methylated genes increased proportionally to the lesion severity.

The poor predictive value of the current biomarkers highlights the need to explore novel and innovative methods, such as epigenetics, for the discovery of new biomarkers. Cell differentiation and function of immune cells is dependent on epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression without altering the original DNA sequence. These epigenetic mechanisms are dynamic, potentially heritable, change with age, and can be regulated and influenced by environmental conditions. One of the most well-known epigenetic mechanisms is DNA methylation, which comprises the methylation of a cytosine (C) next to a guanine (G; CpG dinucleotides). Aberrant DNA methylation is increasingly associated with disease, including immune-mediated diseases, and these alterations precede the clinical phenotype. The impact of DNA methylation profiles on transplant acceptance and rejection as well as on other post-transplant complications is unknown. In this study we examine the current evidence of the functional role of recipient and donor DNA methylation on outcome after organ transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that excess alcohol consumption might increase risk of colorectal carcinoma with hypomethylation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) differentially methylated region-0 (DMR0), which was previously associated with a worse prognosis. DESIGN: With the use of a molecular pathologic epidemiology database in 2 prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we examined the association between alcohol intake and incident colorectal cancer according to the tumor methylation level of IGF2 DMR0. Duplication-method Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression for competing risk data were used to compute HRs and 95% CIs. In addition, we investigated intakes of vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, methionine, and folate as exposures. RESULTS: During 3,206,985 person-years of follow-up, we identified 993 rectal and colon cancer cases with an available tumor DNA methylation status. Compared with no alcohol consumption, the consumption of >/=15 g alcohol/d was associated with elevated risk of colorectal cancer with lower levels of IGF2 DMR0 methylation [within the first and second quartiles: HRs of 1.55 (95% CI: 1.08, 2.24) and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.44, 3.07), respectively]. By contrast, alcohol consumption was not associated with cancer with higher levels of IGF2 DMR0 methylation. The association between alcohol and cancer risk differed significantly by IGF2 DMR0 methylation level (P-heterogeneity = 0.006). The association of vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folate intakes with cancer risk did not significantly differ according to IGF2 DMR0 methylation level (P-heterogeneity > 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Higher alcohol consumption was associated with risk of colorectal cancer with IGF2 DMR0 hypomethylation but not risk of cancer with high-level IGF2 DMR0 methylation. The association between alcohol intake and colorectal cancer risk may differ by tumor epigenetic features.",0,1376

In silico analysis shows that the newly identified histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 2 is highly expressed in breast cancer, especially in invasive tumors. However, it is currently unknown how LSD2 regulates chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation in breast cancer. Using short hairpin RNA, we stably knocked down LSD2 (LSD2-KD) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. LSD2-KD led to accumulation of H3K4me1/2 without changing methylation levels of other key histone lysine residues, suggesting that LSD2 acts as a bona fide H3K4 demethylase in breast cancer cells. LSD2-KD resulted in decreased colony formation and attenuated global DNA methylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, treatment with the DNMT inhibitor, 5-aza-deoxycytidine (DAC), synergistically increased mRNA expression of aberrantly silenced genes important in breast cancer development, including PR, RARbeta, ERalpha, SFRP1, SFRP2, and E-cadherin in LSD2-KD cells. Furthermore, LSD2-KD cells are more susceptible to cell death than scramble controls, and combined treatment with tranylcypromine, an LSD2 inhibitor, and DAC resulted in synergistic growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. DNMT inhibition by DAC in LSD2-KD cells led to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, enhanced PARP cleavage and increased sub-G1 apoptotic cell population. These results demonstrate an important role for LSD2 in regulation of DNA methylation and gene silencing in breast cancer, and suggest that inhibition of LSD2 in combination with DNA methyltransferase inhibition represents a novel approach for epigenetic therapy of breast cancer.",3.94,1697
27223069,Higher methylation intensity induced by EBV LMP1 via NF-kappaB/ DNMT3b signaling contributes to silencing of PTEN gene.,"['Peng H', 'Chen Y', 'Gong P', 'Cai L', 'Lyu X', 'Jiang Q', 'Wang J', 'Lu J', 'Yao K', 'Liu K', 'Li J', 'Li X']",Oncotarget,2016,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a major tumor suppressor and usually silenced via the deletion, insertion and mutation. We previously discovered its inactivation via aberrant CpG island methylation. Here, we provide further evidence that EBV latent membrane protein 1(LMP1) can induce a higher intensity of DNA methylation at PTEN CpG islands, inactivating PTEN at the cellular and molecular level. Initially, increased methylation intensity of PTEN CpG islands was observed in EBV-infected nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, accompanied by decreased PTEN expression. In NPC tissue samples showing the methylation at PTEN promoter, LMP1 was highly expressed in higher methylation intensity group relative to lower intensity group, and DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) expression was positively correlated with LMP1 expression. Moreover, transfection of LMP1 gene into EBV-negative NPC cells demonstrated that LMP1 up-regulated DNMT3b expression, leading to a higher intensity of PTEN CpG island methylation. Mechanistically, computational prediction and luciferase reporter assay identified a functional NF-kappaB binding site on DNMT3b promoter and the mutated NF-kappaB binding site abolished LMP1-mediated DNMT3b activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation displayed that NF-kappaB p65 subunit constitutively bound to DNMT3b promoter, supporting the activation of DNMT3b by EBV LMP1 via NF-kappaB signaling. Furthermore, the expression level of DNMT3b was observed to be increased in the nuclei of LMP1-expressing NPC cells, and a NF-kappaB inhibitor, PDTC, counteracted LMP1-mediated DNMT3b overexpression. Thus, this study first reports that LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB can up-regulate DNMT3b transcription, thereby leading to relatively higher methylation intensity at PTEN CpG islands, and ultimately silencing major tumor suppressor PTEN.",6.359,719

This study aimed to explore the influence of CHD5 methylation of CRC TSG on its clinical and pathological characteristics. A total of 40 operation samples as well as corresponding tissue specimens were collected from CRC patients treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January to December in 2014. CHD5 gene methylation in tissue specimens was detected with methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP); moreover, messenger ribose nucleic acid (mRNA) expression of CHD5 in each tissue was tested using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot was applied to detect the expression of CHD5 protein in those tissues and to analyze the correlation between mRNA and protein of cancer tissue CHD5 as well as the relationship between CHD5 methylation and protein expression. Results revealed that the expression rate of CHD5 methylation in 40 normal mucosal tissues, para-carcinoma tissues, adenoma tissues and CRC tissues was 12.5% (5/40), 22.5% (9/40), 47.5% (19/40) and 72.5% (33/40), respectively. The mRNA expression of CHD5 in the above tissues was 0.225+/-0.276, 0.169+/-0.231, 0.147+/-0.159 and 0.013+/-0.011 and the protein expression of CHD5 was 0.438+/-0.205, 0.398+/-0.180, 0.156+/-0.1 and 0.024+/-0.311, respectively. Methylation rate of CHD5 was 87% (20/23) in 23 cases of CHD5 protein loss expression and 52.9% (9/17) in 17 cases of CHD5 protein expression. Results of chi-squared test indicated that there was a significant difference in methylation rate (P less than 0.05), that is, the methylation rate of negatively expressed CHD5 protein was obviously higher than positively expressed protein. Thus, it can be concluded that the CHD5 methylation rate rises gradually in the evolution of CRC, which is related to the occurrence and development of CRC. Furthermore, CHD5 mRNA is positively correlated with protein expression and CHD5 gene methylation is associated with protein loss expression. Therefore, TSG CHD5 methylation of rectal cancer has a great effect in influencing its clinical and pathological features.",2.04,285

Increasing evidence shows that aberrant epigenetic regulation of miRNAs is a contributing factor to their altered expression in cancer. In this study, we investigate whether expression of miR-200c and miR-141 in PCa is related to the DNA methylation status of their promoter. METHODS: PCR analysis of miR-200c and miR-141, and CpG methylation analysis of their common promoter, was performed in PCa cell-lines and in archived prostate biopsy specimens. The biological significance of miR-200c and miR-141 expression in prostate cancer cells was assessed by a series of in vitro bioassays and the effect on proposed targets DNMT3A and TET1/TET3 was investigated. The effect on promoter methylation status in cells treated with demethylating agents was also examined. RESULTS: miR-200c and miR-141 are both highly elevated in LNCaP, 22RV1, and DU145 cells, but significantly reduced in PC3 cells. This correlates inversely with the methylation status of the miR-200c/miR-141 promoter, which is unmethylated in LNCaP, 22RV1, and DU145 cells, but hypermethylated in PC3. In PC3 cells, miR-200c and miR-141 expression is subsequently elevated by treatment with the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine) and by knockdown of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), suggesting their expression is regulated by methylation. Expression of miR-200c and miR-141 in prostate biopsy tissue was inversely correlated with methylation in promoter CpG sites closest to the miR-200c/miR-141 loci. In vitro, over-expression of miR-200c in PC3 cells inhibited growth and clonogenic potential, as well as inducing apoptosis. Expression of the genes DNMT3A and TET1/TET3 were down-regulated by miR-200c and miR-141 respectively. Finally, treatment with the soy isoflavone genistein caused demethylation of the promoter CpG sites closest to the miR-200c/miR-141 loci resulting in increased miR-200c expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that miR-200c and miR-141 are under epigenetic regulation in PCa cells. We propose that profiling their expression and methylation status may have potential as a novel biomarker or focus of therapeutic intervention in the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether there is a unique methylation profile of the TNF-alpha gene promoter in blood cells of individuals with CP and RA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study participants consisted of 30 Japanese adults with RA (RA group), 30 race-matched adults with CP only (CP group) and 30 race-matched healthy controls (H group). Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood was modified by sodium bisulfite and analyzed, by direct sequencing, to investigate DNA methylation of the TNF-alpha gene promoter region. The level of TNF-alpha produced in mononuclear cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide was determined using ELISA. RESULTS: Twelve cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) motifs were identified in the TNF-alpha promoter fragment from -343 to +57 bp. The CP group showed a significantly higher methylation rate and frequency at -72 bp than the H group (p < 0.01). The RA group exhibited significantly higher methylation rates at seven CpG motifs (-302, -163, -119, -72, -49, -38 and +10 bp), and significantly higher methylation frequencies at six CpG motifs (-163, -119, -72, -49, -38 and +10 bp), than the H group (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). The levels of TNF-alpha produced were significantly different between individuals with and without methylation at -163 bp (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the hypermethylated status of CpG motifs in the TNF-alpha gene promoter in blood cells may be unique to Japanese adults with CP and RA.",2.466,1058

Here we demonstrate that protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) methylates p21 at arginine 156 and promotes phosphorylation of threonine 145 on p21, resulting in the increase of cytoplasmic localization of p21. The cytoplasmic presence of p21 makes cancer cells more resistant to cytotoxic agents.

The low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-a (FCGR2A) gene was reported to be involved in the susceptibility of KD. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression; thus, we hypothesized that methylation status of CpG islands in FCGR2A promoter associates with the susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes of Kawasaki disease. In this study, 36 KD patients and 24 healthy subjects from out-patient clinic were recruited. Eleven potential methylation sites within the targeted promoter region of FCGR2A were selected for investigation. We marked the eleven methylation sites from A to K. Our results indicated that methylation at the CpG sites G, H, and J associated with the risk of KD. CpG sites B, C, E, F, H, J, and K were found to associate with the outcomes of IVIG treatment. In addition, CpG sites G, J, and K were predicted as transcription factors binding sites for NF-kB, Myc-Max, and SP2, respectively. Our study reported a significant association among the promoter methylation of FCGR2A, susceptibility of KD, and the therapeutic outcomes of IVIG treatment.

To calibrate analytical biases in quantification of gene methylation, especially those that arise during PCR, we utilized reference materials that represent exact bisulfite-converted sequences with 0% and 100% methylation status of specific genes. After determining relative quantities using qPCR, pairs of plasmids were gravimetrically mixed to generate working standards with predefined DNA methylation levels at 10% intervals in terms of mole fractions. The working standards were used as controls to optimize the experimental conditions and also as calibration standards in melting-based and sequencing-based analyses of DNA methylation.

We hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in EMT and to test this hypothesis we analyzed global and gene-specific changes in DNA methylation during TGF-beta-induced EMT in ovarian cancer cells. Epigenetic profiling using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450) revealed extensive (P < 0.01) methylation changes after TGF-beta stimulation (468 and 390 CpG sites altered at 48 and 120 h post cytokine treatment, respectively). The majority of gene-specific TGF-beta-induced methylation changes occurred in CpG islands located in or near promoters (193 and 494 genes hypermethylated at 48 and 120 h after TGF-beta stimulation, respectively). Furthermore, methylation changes were sustained for the duration of TGF-beta treatment and reversible after the cytokine removal. Pathway analysis of the hypermethylated loci identified functional networks strongly associated with EMT and cancer progression, including cellular movement, cell cycle, organ morphology, cellular development, and cell death and survival. Altered methylation and corresponding expression of specific genes during TGF-beta-induced EMT included CDH1 (E-cadherin) and COL1A1 (collagen 1A1). Furthermore, TGF-beta induced both expression and activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) -1, -3A, and -3B, and treatment with the DNMT inhibitor SGI-110 prevented TGF-beta-induced EMT. These results demonstrate that dynamic changes in the DNA methylome are implicated in TGF-beta-induced EMT and metastasis. We suggest that targeting DNMTs may inhibit this process by reversing the EMT genes silenced by DNA methylation in cancer.",4.78,1106

The research on the relationship between PACAP and different growth traits would contribute to explain its function during the process of growth. Moreover, epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation at the CpG sites of the SNPs, play important roles in regulating gene expression. The results suggest that a SNP mutation (c.C151G) in the PACAP gene of male half smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is significantly associated with growth traits and serum physiological and biochemical parameters such as inorganic phosphorus (P < 0.05). The SNP is located in a CpG-rich region of exon 1. Intriguingly, the transition (C-->G) added a new methylation site of PACAP gene. This SNP was also significantly related to the expression and methylation level of PACAP (P < 0.05). Individuals with GG genotype had faster growth rates than those of CG and CC genotypes. Moreover, GG genotype had significantly higher PACAP expression level and lower methylation level than CG and CC genotypes. In the serum indexes, only inorganic phosphorus content within GG genotypes was significantly higher than CC genotypes. This implied that the mutation and methylation status of PACAP gene could influence growth traits and this locus could be considered as a candidate genetic or epigenetic marker for Cynoglossus semilaevis molecular breeding.",1.622,1962

We identified a methylation locus in the CYP11A1 gene, which is regulated by corticotropin, that is hypo-methylated in individuals hospitalized for mania compared with unaffected controls. DNA methylation levels at this locus appear to be state related as levels in follow-up samples collected from mania patients six months after hospitalization were similar to those observed in controls. In addition, we found that methylation levels at the CYP11A1 locus were significantly correlated with three inflammatory markers in serum in acute mania cases but not in unaffected controls. We conclude that mania is associated with alterations in levels of DNA methylation and inflammatory markers.

Aberrant glycosylation is profoundly involved in malignant transformation, tumor progression and metastasis. Some glycan structures are tumor-specific and reflect disturbed glycan biosynthesis pathways. METHODS: We analyzed DNA methylation and expression of 86 glyco-genes in melanoma, hepatocellular, breast and cervical cancers using data from publicly available databases. We also analyzed methylation datasets without the available matching expression data for glyco-genes in lung cancer, and progression of melanoma into lymph node and brain metastases. RESULTS: Ten glyco-genes (GALNT3, GALNT6, GALNT7, GALNT14, MGAT3, MAN1A1, MAN1C1, ST3GAL2, ST6GAL1, ST8SIA3) showing changes in both methylation and expression in the same type of cancer belong to GalNAc transferases, GlcNAc transferases, mannosidases and sialyltransferases, which is in line with changes in glycan structures already reported in the same type of tumors. Some of those genes were additionally identified as potentially valuable for disease prognosis. The MGAT5B gene, so far identified as specifically expressed in brain, emerged as a novel candidate gene that is epigenetically dysregulated in different cancers other than brain cancer. We also report for the first time aberrant expression of the GALNT and MAN genes in cancer by aberrant promoter methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant expression of glyco-genes due to aberrant promoter methylation could be a way leading to characteristic glycosylation profiles commonly described in cancer.

We have examined structural and spectroscopic properties of wild-type rhodopsin (with 11-cis-9,13-dimethyl-RPSB) and artificial rhodopsins, hosting four 11-cis-RPSB derivatives, 13-demethyl-, 9-demethyl-, 10-methyl-13-demethyl-, and 10-methyl-RPSB, evolving along the photoisomerization coordinate. It is found that the addition of 10-methyl or/and deletion of 9-/13-methyl groups do not appear to interfere structurally with the photoisomerization pathway in the S1 excited state. Remarkably, the two-mode space-saving mechanism initiated by bond order inversion and followed by asynchronous bicycle-pedal distortion in the RPSB backbone drives the photoreaction in all rhodopsin analogues studied here. However, methylation and/or demethylation is responsible for perturbation of excess energy deposited in the conical intersection structures.

Aberrant DNA-methylated genes in 24 NPC tissues and 24 noncancer nasopharyngitis biopsy tissues (NCNBT) were identified using Illumina 450K BeadChip. Correlations between DNA methylation and clinical outcomes were evaluated using bisulfite pyrosequencing in 454 NPC patients.

In addition, CaSki cervical cancer cells were cultured in vitro and treated with various concentrations of folic acid. The DNA methylation states of miR-203 and miR-375 were subsequently detected by methylation-specific PCR, and the expression levels were evaluated using RT-PCR. miR-203 and miR-375 were significantly downregulated in CIN and cervical cancer tissues, compared with the control group. There was a marked difference in terms of the expression levels of miR-375 between the two groups (P<0.05). In CaSki cells, as the concentration of folic acid increased, the positive rate of DNA methylation of miR-203 and miR-375 decreased, while the expression levels of miR-203 and miR-375 demonstrated a gradual increase, which indicated that the latter two parameters were negatively correlated (P<0.05). Compared with normal cervical tissue, the expression levels of miR-203 and miR-375 were downregulated in CIN and cervical cancer. Methylation of these two miRs was apparent in CaSki cells, and was associated with a lack of folic acid.

In the present study, a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in hepatoblastoma (HB) tissues was performed to verify differential methylation levels between HB and normal tissues. As alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has a critical role in HB, AFP methylation levels were also detected using pyrosequencing. Normal and HB liver tissue samples (frozen tissue) were obtained from patients with HB. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in these tissues was performed using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and the results were confirmed with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip demonstrated distinctively less methylation in HB tissues than in non-tumor tissues. In addition, methylation enrichment was observed in positions near the transcription start site of AFP, which exhibited lower methylation levels in HB tissues than in non-tumor liver tissues. Lastly, a significant negative correlation was observed between AFP messenger RNA expression and DNA methylation percentage, using linear Pearson's R correlation coefficients. The present results demonstrate differential methylation levels between HB and normal tissues, and imply that aberrant methylation of AFP in HB could reflect HB development. Expansion of these findings could provide useful insight into HB biology.",1.554,800
27208249,Analysis of Chromatin Regulators Reveals Specific Features of Rice DNA Methylation Pathways.,"['Tan F', 'Zhou C', 'Zhou Q', 'Zhou S', 'Yang W', 'Zhao Y', 'Li G', 'Zhou DX']",Plant physiology,2016,"Plant DNA methylation that occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH sites (H = A, C, or T) is a hallmark of the repression of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TEs). The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains about 40% repetitive sequence and TEs and displays specific patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation. The mechanism responsible for the specific methylation patterns is unclear. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDDM1 (Deficient in DNA Methylation 1) and OsDRM2 (Deficient in DNA Methylation 1) in genome-wide DNA methylation, TE repression, small RNA accumulation, and gene expression. We show that OsDDM1 is essential for high levels of methylation at CHG and, to a lesser extent, CG sites in heterochromatic regions and also is required for CHH methylation that mainly locates in the genic regions of the genome. In addition to a large member of TEs, loss of OsDDM1 leads to hypomethylation and up-regulation of many protein-coding genes, producing very severe growth phenotypes at the initial generation. Importantly, we show that OsDRM2 mutation results in a nearly complete loss of CHH methylation and derepression of mainly small TE-associated genes and that OsDDM1 is involved in facilitating OsDRM2-mediated CHH methylation. Thus, the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 defines distinct DNA methylation pathways in the bulk of DNA methylation of the genome, which is possibly related to the dispersed heterochromatin across chromosomes in rice and suggests that DNA methylation mechanisms may vary among different plant species.",6.841,932

Alteration in DNA methylation is thought to play a role in this resistance. Here, we analyzed DNA methylation changes in a matched model of radiation resistance for HNSCC using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our results show that compared to radiation-sensitive cells (SCC-61), radiation-resistant cells (rSCC-61) had a significant increase in DNA methylation. After combining these results with microarray gene expression data, we identified 84 differentially methylated and expressed genes between these 2 cell lines. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed ILK signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, fatty acid alpha-oxidation, and cell cycle regulation as top canonical pathways associated with radiation resistance. Validation studies focused on CCND2, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, which was identified as hypermethylated in the promoter region and downregulated in rSCC-61 relative to SCC-61 cells. Treatment of rSCC-61 and SCC-61 with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'deoxycitidine increased CCND2 levels only in rSCC-61 cells, while treatment with the control reagent cytosine arabinoside did not influence the expression of this gene. Further analysis of HNSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas found increased methylation in radiation-resistant tumors, consistent with the cell culture data. Our findings point to global DNA methylation status as a biomarker of radiation resistance in HNSCC, and suggest a need for targeted manipulation of DNA methylation to increase radiation response in HNSCC.",4.78,780

This study aims to investigate the novel biomarkers in endometrial carcinoma, and explore their epigenetic regulation. METHODS: Methylation of six tumor suppressor genes (CDH13, SHP1, HIN1, DKK3, CTNNA1 and PCDH8) was evaluated in 155 endometrium samples. Changes of methylation and mRNA expression after treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) or/and trichostatin A (TSA) were investigated by MSP and qRT-PCR respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect the interactions between UHRF1 and PRMT5 proteins. RESULTS: CDH13 and SHP1 promoters were highly methylated (81.36% and 86.44%, respectively) in endometrial carcinoma, while CDH13 promoter methylation was also present in complex hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia (51.72% and 50.00%, respectively). Methylation of CDH13 and SHP1 promoters was associated with age and tumor differentiation or muscular infiltration depth. CDH13 and SHP1 promoters were completely methylated in endometrial carcinoma cell lines and were partially reversed by 5-Aza-CdR or TSA to induce mRNA levels (P<0.01). After combined treatment with these two agents, methylation of CDH13 and SHP1 promoters was completely reversed and expression of their mRNA was significantly increased (P<0.01). Moreover, PRMT5 could bind to UHRF1 and down-regulated by 5-Aza-CdR and/or TSA treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate for the first time that SHP1 methylation has high specificity for diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma, while CDH13 promoter methylation plays a role in the earlier stage. Furthermore, UHRF1 could form a complex with PRMT5 to contribute to the endometrial carcinogenesis.",3.774,97

For individuals who present with early stage disease of papillary and follicular cancers, there are no accurate markers to predict whether they will develop metastatic or recurrent disease. Our immediate goal is to molecularly differentiate follicular cancer subtypes for enhanced classification. Promoter methylation status of genes with reported associations in thyroid cancer (CASP8, CDKN2A, DAPK1, ESR1, NIS, RASSF1 and TIMP3) were examined in a cohort of follicular thyroid cancers comprising of 26 Hurthle and 27 Classic subtypes utilizing quantitative methylation-specific PCR. RASSF1 was differentially methylated in Classic tumor tissue compared to Hurthle (p<0.001). Methylation of RASSF1 pointed to racial group differences between African Americans and Caucasian Americans (p=0.05). Extra thyroidal extension was found to be associated with DAPK1 (p=0.014) and ESR1 (p=0.036) methylation. Late stage disease was associated with older age (p<0.001) and methylation of DAPK1 (p=0.034) and ESR1 (p=0.035).

We measured MAOA gene transcription and analyzed the VNTR genotype and methylation status of the gene promoter region in different dog breeds to determine whether MAOA expression is correlated with the MAOA genotype or epigenetic modification in dogs. We found brain-specific expression of the MAOA gene and different transcription levels in different dog breeds including Beagle, Sapsaree, and German shepherd, and also a robust association of the DNA methylation of the gene promoter with mRNA levels. However, the 90 bp tandem repeats that we observed near the transcription start site were not variable, indicating no correlation with canine MAOA activity. These results show that differential DNA methylation in the MAOA promoter region may affect gene expression by modulating promoter activity. Moreover, the distinctive patterns of MAOA expression and DNA methylation may be involved in breed-specific or individual behavioral characteristics, such as aggression, because behavioral phenotypes are related to different physiological and neuroendocrine responses.",2.138,182

We studied FAIM2 promoter methylation in 59 obese and 39 lean children using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. The methylation levels at 8 CpG sites in the FAIM2 promoter were significantly different between the obese and lean subjects, especially the methylation level at CpG site 500 (p = 0.01). The methylation levels at several of the examined CpG sites were significantly associated with dyslipidaemia and its components after adjusting for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). The methylation levels at two CpG sites (sites -362 and -360 and site -164) were highly significantly associated with high level of triglycerides (p = 0.00002 and 0.0009, respectively).

Both hybridization and genome doubling may affect the DNA methylation status of newly formed allopolyploid plants. Previous studies demonstrated that changes in cytosine methylation levels and patterns were different among individual hybrid plant, therefore, studies investigating the characteristics of variation in cytosine methylation status must be conducted at the population level to avoid sampling error. In the present study, an F1 hybrid diploid population and three allotriploid populations with different heterozygosity [originating from first-division restitution (FDR), second-division restitution (SDR), and post-meiotic restitution (PMR) 2n eggs of the same female parent] were used to investigate cytosine methylation inheritance and variation relative to their common parents using methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). The variation in cytosine methylation in individuals in each population exhibited substantial differences, confirming the necessity of population epigenetics. The total methylation levels of the diploid population were significantly higher than in the parents, but those of the three allotriploid populations were significantly lower than in the parents, indicating that both hybridization and polyploidization contributed to cytosine methylation variation. The vast majority of methylated status could be inherited from the parents, and the average percentages of non-additive variation were 6.29, 3.27, 5.49 and 5.07% in the diploid, FDR, SDR and PMR progeny populations, respectively.

In the present study, the diagnostic utility of the SHOX2 assay was tested with regard to cytology for different cytological diagnostic categories to assess whether it can complement the cytological examination and the DNA methylation marker panel targeting the gene promoters of adenomatous polyposis coli 1A (APC), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (p16(INK4A)) and Ras association domain family protein 1 (RASSF1A) regarding lung cancer detection in bronchial aspirates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected DNA from 169 patients (cytological diagnosis: 47 tumor-positive, 56 equivocal and 66 tumor-negative) was analyzed for SHOX2 DNA methylation utilizing QMSP. Patients were followed-up for a period of 11 months maximum. RESULTS: When equivocal diagnoses were categorized as tumor-positive, cytology and SHOX2 DNA methylation achieved 72% and 64% sensitivity and 63% and 98% specificity, respectively. SHOX2 DNA methylation identified 66% of the patients with cancer subsequent to a cytological equivocal diagnosis. SHOX2 complements the cytological diagnosis and the methylation marker panel.

We describe the residue-specific methylation of E2F-1 by the asymmetric dimethylating protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) and symmetric dimethylating PRMT5 and relate the marks to different functional consequences of E2F-1 activity. Methylation by PRMT1 hinders methylation by PRMT5, which augments E2F-1-dependent apoptosis, whereas PRMT5-dependent methylation favors proliferation by antagonizing methylation by PRMT1. The ability of E2F-1 to prompt apoptosis in DNA damaged cells coincides with enhanced PRMT1 methylation. In contrast, cyclin A binding to E2F-1 impedes PRMT1 methylation and augments PRMT5 methylation, thus ensuring that E2F-1 is locked into its cell-cycle progression mode. The Tudor domain protein p100-TSN reads the symmetric methylation mark, and binding of p100-TSN downregulates E2F-1 apoptotic activity.

Arsenic is associated with a number of health outcomes, with epigenetic modification suggested as a potential mechanism of toxicity. OBJECTIVE: Among a sample of 400 adult participants, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, as measured by blood and urinary total arsenic concentrations, and epigenome-wide white blood cell DNA methylation. METHODS: We used linear regression models to examine the associations between arsenic exposure and methylation at each CpG site, adjusted for sex, age, and batch. Differentially methylated loci were subsequently examined in relation to corresponding gene expression for functional evidence of gene regulation. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we observed four differentially methylated CpG sites with urinary total arsenic concentration and three differentially methylated CpG sites with blood arsenic concentration, based on the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p < 1 x 10(-7). Methylation of PLA2G2C (probe cg04605617) was the most significantly associated locus in relation to both urinary (p = 3.40 x 10(-11)) and blood arsenic concentrations (p = 1.48 x 10(-11)). Three additional novel methylation loci-SQSTM1 (cg01225779), SLC4A4 (cg06121226), and IGH (cg13651690)--were also significantly associated with arsenic exposure. Further, there was evidence of methylation-related gene regulation based on gene expression for a subset of differentially methylated loci.

RESULTS: BRCA1 promoter methylation was observed in 35.7 % of patients in the first group and in 33.6 % in the second group. BRCA1 promoter methylation was associated with significant increase in median progression-free survival (PFS) of ovarian cancer patients receiving adjuvant platinum-taxane-based chemotherapy (P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that BRCA1 promoter methylation remains a favorable factor in regard to PFS (HR 0.52; 95 % CI 0.32-0.85, P = 0.009) after adjustment for other prognostic factors. Under the patients with recurrent disease, BRCA1 promoter methylation was associated with significant longer median PFS of 18.5 months in comparison with 12.8 months PFS for patients without BRCA1 promoter methylation.

The analysis of chromosome aberrations was performed on peripheral lymphocytes. RESULTS: Global DNA methylation levels were lower in radiation-exposed workers than in controls. The methylation levels were negatively associated with the recent 1.5-year radiation dose in a multiple linear regression model (beta = - 0.0088, p </= 0.001); the levels increased proportionally with the total cumulative dose in radiation-exposed workers. LINE-1 methylation levels were higher in radiation-exposed workers than in controls and were significantly associated with the total cumulative radiation dose in a multiple linear regression model (beta = - 0.031, p = 0.035). Global DNA methylation levels were also correlated with chromosome aberrations among workers. Workers with low global methylation levels had a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations than did subjects with high global methylation levels.

Although there was a significant negative correlation between u-Se and u-As (median 137; range 49-927 mug/g creatinine), closer examination revealed a non-monotonous relationship between them. A quadratic curve with an axis of As at 155 mug/g Cre gave a better fit, and u-As and u-Se were positively or negatively correlated depending on whether the As concentration was lower or higher than 155 mug As/g Cre, respectively. Likewise, the relationships between the As methylation pattern and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) polymorphism, body mass index (BMI), and u-Se differed depending on the u-As range; i.e., higher or lower than 155 mug/g Cre.

Further study of Kin17 revealed a function in DNA replication and repair, as well as in pre-mRNA processing. Recently, it was found that Kin17 is methylated on lysine 135 by the newly discovered methyltransferase METTL22. To better understand the function of Kin17 and its regulation by methylation, we used multiple cell compartment protein affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (MCC-AP-MS) to identify novel interaction partners of Kin17 and to assess whether these interactions can take place on chromatin. Our results confirm that Kin17 interacts with METTL22 both in the soluble and chromatin fractions. We also show that many RNA-binding proteins, including the previously identified interactor BUD13 as well as spliceosomal and ribosomal subunits, associate with Kin17 in the soluble fraction. Interestingly, overexpression of METTL22 in HEK 293 cells displaces Kin17 from the chromatin to the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting a role for methylation of lysine 135, a residue that lies within a winged helix domain of Kin17, in regulating association with chromatin. These results are discussed in view of the putative cellular function of Kin17. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results shown here broaden our understanding of METTL22, a member of a family of newly-discovered non-histone lysine methyltransferases and its substrate, Kin17, a DNA/RNA-binding protein with reported roles in DNA repair and replication and mRNA processing.

In contrast, our understanding of the biological roles for lysine methylation of non-histone proteins has progressed more slowly. Though recently it has attracted less attention, epsilon-methyl-lysine in non-histone proteins was first observed over 50 years ago. In that time, it has become clear that, like the case for histones, non-histone methylation represents a key and common signaling process within the cell. Recent work suggests that non-histone methylation occurs on hundreds of proteins found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and with important biomedical implications. Technological advances that allow us to identify lysine methylation on a proteomic scale are opening new avenues in the non-histone methylation field, which is poised for dramatic growth.

Herein, we developed a highly sensitive fluorescence assay of DNA methyltransferase by methylation-sensitive cleavage-based primer generation exponential isothermal amplification (PG-EXPA) coupled with supramolecular fluorescent Zinc(II)-protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX)/G-quadruplex. In the presence of DNA adenine methylation (Dam) MTase, the methylation-responsive sequence of hairpin probe is methylated and cleaved by the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease Dpn I. The cleaved hairpin probe then functions as a signal primer to initiate the exponential isothermal amplification reaction (EXPAR) by hybridizing with a unimolecular DNA containing three functional domains as the amplification template, producing a large number of G-quadruplex nanostructures by utilizing polymerases and nicking enzymes as mechanical activators. The G-quadruplex nanostructures act as host for ZnPPIX that lead to supramolecular complexes ZnPPIX/G-quadruplex, which provides optical labels for amplified fluorescence detection of Dam MTase. While in the absence of Dam MTase, neither methylation/cleavage nor PG-EXPA reaction can be initiated and no fluorescence signal is observed. The proposed method exhibits a wide dynamic range from 0.0002 to 20U/mL and an extremely low detection limit of 8.6x10(-5)U/mL, which is superior to most conventional approaches for the MTase assay. Owing to the specific site recognition of MTase toward its substrate, the proposed sensing system was able to readily discriminate Dam MTase from other MTase such as M.SssI and even detect the target in a complex biological matrix. Furthermore, the application of the proposed sensing strategy for screening Dam MTase inhibitors was also demonstrated with satisfactory results. This novel method not only provides a promising platform for monitoring activity and inhibition of DNA MTases, but also shows great potentials in biological process researches, drugs discovery and clinical diagnostics.",6.409,738

 Series B, Biological sciences",2014,"The growing list of mutations implicated in monogenic disorders of the developing brain includes at least seven genes (ARX, CUL4B, KDM5A, KDM5C, KMT2A, KMT2C, KMT2D) with loss-of-function mutations affecting proper regulation of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, a chromatin mark which on a genome-wide scale is broadly associated with active gene expression, with its mono-, di- and trimethylated forms differentially enriched at promoter and enhancer and other regulatory sequences. In addition to these rare genetic syndromes, dysregulated H3K4 methylation could also play a role in the pathophysiology of some cases diagnosed with autism or schizophrenia, two conditions which on a genome-wide scale are associated with H3K4 methylation changes at hundreds of loci in a subject-specific manner. Importantly, the reported alterations for some of the diseased brain specimens included a widespread broadening of H3K4 methylation profiles at gene promoters, a process that could be regulated by the UpSET(KMT2E/MLL5)-histone deacetylase complex. Furthermore, preclinical studies identified maternal immune activation, parental care and monoaminergic drugs as environmental determinants for brain-specific H3K4 methylation. These novel insights into the epigenetic risk architectures of neurodevelopmental disease will be highly relevant for efforts aimed at improved prevention and treatment of autism and psychosis spectrum disorders.",2.147,805
25855800,Infrequent DNA methylation of miR-9-1 and miR-9-3 in multiple myeloma.,"['Zhang Q', 'Wang LQ', 'Wong KY', 'Li ZY', 'Chim CS']",Journal of clinical pathology,2015,"AIMS: The miR-9 family microRNAs (miRNAs) are tumour suppressor miRNAs implicated in carcinogenesis. We postulated that miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3 may be inactivated by aberrant promoter methylation in multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: Methylation of miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3 was studied by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in six normal controls, including three each of healthy peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow buffy coat, 10 MM cell lines, 62 primary MM marrow samples at diagnosis and 22 at relapse/progression. RESULTS: MSP, verified by quantitative pyrosequencing, showed that the promoters of miR-9-3 and miR-9-1 were unmethylated in normal controls but methylated in 4 (40%) and 5 (50%) of 10 MM cell lines, respectively. However, the promoter of miR-9-2 was methylated in three normal PB buffy coat controls and in CD138-sorted healthy marrow plasma cells, indicating possibly tissue specific rather than tumour-specific methylation of miR-9-2, which was thus not studied further. In WL-2 cells, which were completely methylated for miR-9-3, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment caused miR-9-3 promoter demethylation and pri-miR-9-3 re-expression. In primary samples, methylation of miR-9-3 was detected in 1 of 62 patients at diagnosis and 1 of 22 patients at relapse/progression. However, miR-9-1 methylation was absent in both primary samples at diagnosis and at relapse/progression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of miR-9-3 and miR-9-1 is tumour-specific in MM, leading to reversible miRNA silencing. Frequent methylation of miR-9-3 and miR-9-1 in cell lines, but not in primary samples, may be acquired during in vitro culture, and indicates an unimportant role of miR-9 methylation in myelomagenesis.",2.915,450
26242202,Endothelial glucocorticoid receptor promoter methylation according to dexamethasone sensitivity.,"['Mata-Greenwood E', 'Jackson PN', 'Pearce WJ', 'Zhang L']",Journal of molecular endocrinology,2015,"We have previously shown that in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone (DEX) stimulation in human endothelial cells is positively regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1, GR). The present study determined the role of differential GR transcriptional regulation in glucocorticoid sensitivity. We studied 25 human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that had been previously characterized as DEX-sensitive (n=15), or resistant (n=10). Real-time PCR analysis of GR 5'UTR mRNA isoforms showed that all HUVECs expressed isoforms 1B, 1C, 1D, 1F, and 1H, and isoforms 1B and 1C were predominantly expressed. DEX-resistant cells expressed higher basal levels of the 5'UTR mRNA isoforms 1C and 1D, but lower levels of the 5'UTR mRNA isoform 1F than DEX-sensitive cells. DEX treatment significantly decreased GRalpha and GR-1C mRNA isoform expression in DEX-resistant cells only. Reporter luciferase assays indicated that differential GR mRNA isoform expression was not due to differential promoter usage between DEX-sensitive and DEX-resistant cells. Analysis of promoter methylation, however, showed that DEX-sensitive cells have higher methylation levels of promoter 1D and lower methylation levels of promoter 1F than DEX-resistant cells. Treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine abolished the differential 5'UTR mRNA isoform expression between DEX-sensitive and DEX-resistant cells. Finally, both GRalpha overexpression and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment eliminated the differences between sensitivity groups to DEX-mediated downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1). In sum, human endothelial GR 5'UTR mRNA expression is regulated by promoter methylation with DEX-sensitive and DEX-resistant cells having different GR promoter methylation patterns.",3.081,278

Alterations in methylation patterns within promoter regions are linked with aberrant transcription and pathological gene expression; however the role of methylation within non-promoter regions is not yet fully elucidated. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed whole genome methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) in peripheral-blood-derived DNA from age-gender-body mass index (BMI)-ethnicity matched type 2 diabetic, pre-diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: The density of methylation normalized to the average length of the promoter, intergenic and intragenic regions and to CpG count was 3.17, 9.80 and 0.09 for the promoter, intergenic and intragenic regions, respectively. Methylation within these regions varied according to glucose tolerance status and was associated with hypermethylation rather than hypomethylation. MicroRNA-DNA methylation peaks accounted for 4.8% of the total number of peaks detected. Differential DNA methylation of these microRNA peaks was observed during dysglycemia, with the promoter, intergenic and intragenic regions accounting for 2%, 95% and 3% respectively, of the differentially methylated microRNA peaks. CONCLUSION: Genome-wide DNA methylation varied according to glucose tolerance. Methylation within non-promoter regions accounted for the majority of differentially methylated peaks identified, thus highlighting the importance of DNA methylation within these non-promoter regions in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. This study suggests that DNA methylation within intergenic regions is a mechanism regulating microRNAs, another increasingly important epigenetic factor, during type 2 diabetes.",2.275,855
26822703,DNA methylation in the pathophysiology of hyperphenylalaninemia in the PAH mouse model of phenylketonuria.,"['Dobrowolski SF', 'Lyons-Weiler J', 'Spridik K', 'Vockley J', 'Skvorak K', 'Biery A']",Molecular genetics and metabolism,2016,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficient phenylketonuria (PKU) is the paradigm for a treatable inborn error of metabolism where maintaining plasma phenylalanine (Phe) in the therapeutic range relates to improved clinical outcomes. While Phe is the presumed intoxicating analyte causal in neurologic damage, the mechanism(s) of Phe toxicity has remained elusive. Altered DNA methylation is a recognized response associated with exposure to numerous small molecule toxic agents. Paralleling this effect, we hypothesized that chronic Phe over-exposure in the brain would lead to aberrant DNA methylation with secondary influence upon gene regulation that would ultimately contribute to PKU neuropathology. The PAHenu2 mouse models human PKU with intrinsic hyperphenylalaninemia, abnormal response to Phe challenge, and neurologic deficit. To examine this hypothesis, we assessed DNA methylation patterns in brain tissues using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and paired end sequencing in adult PAHenu2 animals maintained under either continuous dietary Phe restriction or chronic hyperphenylalaninemia. Heterozygous PAHenu2/WT litter mates served as controls for normal Phe exposure. Extensive repatterning of DNA methylation was observed in brain tissue of hyperphenylalaninemic animals while Phe restricted animals displayed an attenuated pattern of aberrant DNA methylation. Affected gene coding regions displayed aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation. Gene body methylation of noncoding RNA genes was observed and among these microRNA genes were prominent. Of particular note, observed only in hyperphenylalaninemic animals, was hypomethylation of miRNA genes within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus on chromosome 12. Aberrant methylation of microRNA genes influenced their expression which has secondary effects upon the expression of targeted protein coding genes. Differential hypermethylation of gene promoters was exclusive to hyperphenylalaninemic PAHenu2 animals. Genes with synaptic involvement were targets of promoter hypermethylation that resulted in down-regulation of their expression. Gene dysregulation secondary to abnormal DNA methylation may be contributing to PKU neuropathology. These results suggest drugs that prevent or correct aberrant DNA methylation may offer a novel therapeutic option to management of neurological symptoms in PKU patients.",2.625,1262

METHODS: Methylation levels of IGFII and N33 were determined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. The temporal trend of methylation levels during gastric cancer development was investigated in 133 gastric cancer cases from two cohorts with pre- and/or post-gastric cancer samples. As the references of pre-GCs, 204 intestinal metaplasia (IM) or dysplasia (DYS) subjects who did not progress to gastric cancer during the follow-up period were selected. Meanwhile, 285 subjects with superficial gastritis/chronic atrophic gastritis (SG/CAG) were also selected as controls. RESULTS: IGFII median methylation level was significantly higher in gastric cancer cases than those with SG/CAG (61.47% vs. 49.73%; P < 0.001). IGFII and N33 methylation levels were elevated at least 5 years ahead of clinical gastric cancer diagnosis comparing with SG/CAG (63.38% vs. 49.73% for IGFII, 9.12% vs. 5.70% for N33; all P < 0.001). Furthermore, the frequency of hypermethylated IGFII was markedly increased in IM or DYS subjects who progressed to gastric cancer in contrast to those who remained with IM and DYS, and adjusted ORs were 12.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.81-41.15] for IM and 10.12 (95% CI, 2.68-38.22) for DYS. Similar results were also found for N33 in subjects with IM (OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.20-11.86).

There is an underlying fibrosis associated with the lamina cribrosa (LC) in glaucoma. DNA methylation is well established in regulating fibrosis and may be a therapeutic target for glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to compare global DNA methylation levels in primary human normal (NLC) and glaucomatous (GLC) cells, and to investigate DNA methylation in driving fibrosis through regulation of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: LC cells were cultured from normal and glaucomatous human donors. Global methylation was assessed by ELISA. qPCR was conducted for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), TGFbeta 1 and 2, collagen 1alpha1 (COL1A1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA). TGFbeta1 and DNMT1 were examined by immunofluorescence. Methylation of the TGFbeta1 promoter was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: Global DNA methylation demonstrated an increase in GLC compared with NLC cells (P<0.05). The previously mentioned methylation and matrix genes were increased in GLC compared with NLC cells (P<0.05). Immunofluorescence showed increased TGFbeta1 and DNMT1 in GLC compared with NLC cells. MSP showed increased unmethylated DNA in the TGFbeta1 promoter of GLC compared with NLC cells. CONCLUSIONS: We found increased expression of fibrotic genes in GLC cells and demonstrated an increase in global DNA methylation and in associated enzymes in GLC cells. Furthermore, we showed decreased promoter methylation of TGFbeta1 in GLC cells.

Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) of methylation and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) between methylation and breast cancer related mortality. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity were associated with increased SCGB3A1 methylation among pre- and post-menopausal cases. Among premenopausal women, compared with Stage 0 cases, cases of invasive cancer were more likely to have increased methylation of RARB (Stage I OR = 4.7, 95% CI: 1.1-19.0; Stage IIA/IIB OR = 9.7, 95% CI: 2.4-39.9; Stage III/IV OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 1.1-29.4) and lower methylation of FHIT (Stage I OR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9; Stage IIA/IIB OR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.8; Stage III/IV OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.1-3.4).

Following predictive tests for externally visible characteristics developed in recent years, prediction of age could guide police investigations and improve the assessment of age-related phenotype expression patterns such as hair colour changes and early onset of male pattern baldness. DNA methylation at CpG positions has emerged as the most promising DNA tests to ascertain the individual age of the donor of a biological contact trace. Although different methodologies are available to detect DNA methylation, EpiTYPER technology (Agena Bioscience, formerly Sequenom) provides useful characteristics that can be applied as a discovery tool in localized regions of the genome. In our study, a total of twenty-two candidate genomic regions, selected from the assessment of publically available data from the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip, had a total of 177 CpG sites with informative methylation patterns that were subsequently investigated in detail. From the methylation analyses made, a novel age prediction model based on a multivariate quantile regression analysis was built using the seven highest age-correlated loci of ELOVL2, ASPA, PDE4C, FHL2, CCDC102B, C1orf132 and chr16:85395429. The detected methylation levels in these loci provide a median absolute age prediction error of +/-3.07years and a percentage of prediction error relative to the age of 6.3%. We report the predictive performance of the developed model using cross validation of a carefully age-graded training set of 725 European individuals and a test set of 52 monozygotic twin pairs.

Moreover, PCDH8 methylation was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.0141), higher grade (P=0.0190), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.0098). In addition, multivariate analysis showed that PCDH8 methylation was independently associated with poor progression-free survival (P=0.0316).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess dose-response relationships of methylation at the top hits from the epigenome-wide methylation studies with smoking exposure as well as with total and cause-specific mortality. METHODS: In a population-based prospective cohort study in Germany, methylation was quantified in baseline blood DNA of 1,000 older adults by the Illumina 450K assay. Deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 10.3 years. Dose-response relationships of smoking exposure with methylation at nine CpGs were modeled by restricted cubic spline regression. Associations of individual and aggregate methylation patterns with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality were assessed by multiple Cox regression. RESULTS: Clear dose-response relationships with respect to current and lifetime smoking intensity were consistently observed for methylation at six of the nine CpGs. Seven of the nine CpGs were also associated with mortality outcomes to various extents. A methylation score based on the top two CpGs (cg05575921 and cg06126421) showed the strongest associations with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) of 3.59 (2.10, 6.16), 7.41 (2.81, 19.54), and 2.48 (1.01, 6.08), respectively, for participants with methylation levels in the lowest quartile at both CpGs. Adding methylation at those two CpGs into a model that included the variables of the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation chart for fatal cardiovascular risk prediction improved the predictive discrimination. CONCLUSION: The novel methylation biomarkers are highly informative for both smoking exposure and smoking-related mortality outcomes. In particular, these biomarkers may substantially improve cardiovascular risk prediction.

Studies show that first exon methylation has a tighter association with gene silencing compared to promoter methylation or gene mutation. However, to our knowledge the clinical importance of exonic methylation in renal cell carcinoma is unknown. We analyzed renal cell carcinoma for VHL gene exonic methylation using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 48 institutionally banked renal cell carcinoma patient tissue samples VHL exon sequencing was done as well as methylation analysis of promoter and exon 1 by mass spectrometry or conventional bisulfite analysis. Methylated human lymphocytic DNA (0% and 100%), nontemplate distilled H2O, and the UOK121 and UOK171 human renal cell carcinoma cell lines served as assay controls. Samples were considered hypermethylated if a CpG site showed greater than 50% methylation. RESULTS: Nine of the 43 patient samples read by our exon 1 assay had methylated VHL exon 1 sites, including 3 showing hypermethylation. The exon 1 methylation assay was robust and reproducible. Samples with exon 1 hypermethylation showed no exonic mutations. All samples assayed at VHL exon 2 were hypermethylated. CONCLUSIONS: To assay renal cell carcinoma tumors for VHL methylation matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is robust and reproducible, and capable of quantifying the methylation status of individual DNA bases. Exon 1 methylation may be an alternate mechanism of VHL gene silencing in renal cell carcinoma in addition to mutation and promoter methylation.

Following DNA replication, DNMT1 is the key enzyme that strictly copies the methylation pattern from the parental strand to the nascent DNA. However, the mechanism underlying this highly specific event is not thoroughly understood. In this study, we identified topoisomerase IIalpha (TopoIIalpha) as a novel regulator of the maintenance DNA methylation. UHRF1, a protein important for global DNA methylation, interacts with TopoIIalpha and regulates its localization to hemimethylated DNA. TopoIIalpha decatenates the hemimethylated DNA following replication, which might facilitate the methylation of the nascent strand by DNMT1. Inhibiting this activity impairs DNA methylation at multiple genomic loci. We have uncovered a novel mechanism during the maintenance of DNA methylation.",0,793

RESULTS: The result showed that GMA induced 16HBE morphorlogical transformation at the dose of 8 microg/mL, and cell exposed to GMA had 1374 genes in protophase, 825 genes in metaphase, 1149 genes in anaphase, respectively; 30 genes are all methylation in the 3 stages; 318 genes in protophase but not in metaphase and anaphase; 272 genes in metaphase but not in protophase and anaphase; 683 genes in anaphase but not in metaphase and protophase; 73 genes in protophase and metaphase but not in anaphase; 67 genes in protophase and anaphase but not in metaphase; 59 genes in metaphase and anaphase but not in protophase. CONCLUSION: The pattern of DNA methylation could change in the process of 16HBE induced by GMA.",1.653,1803

DESIGN: Comparison between testicular DNA and paired cfsDNA, and among NOA patients with different testicular phenotypes. SETTING: Academic research institute and andrology practice. PATIENT(S): Eighty-eight idiopathic NOA patients with different testicular phenotypes and 24 normozoospermic men. INTERVENTION(S): Testicular biopsies and semen analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Five testis-specific methylated promoters were selected. Promoter methylation was quantified using MethyLight in testicular DNA and paired cfsDNA, and the mRNA level was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULT(S): Correlations of methylation of the selected five promoters between testicular DNA and paired cfsDNA were observed; and promoter methylation was negatively related to the messenger RNA level in testis. The cfsDNA methylation of these promoters showed different dynamic changes among the subtypes of NOA and normozoospermia. Among them, CCNA1 and DMRT1 promoter methylation in the hypospermatogenesis group was higher than in other groups and showed diagnostic potential for the patient with hypospermatogenesis. CONCLUSION(S): Cell-free seminal DNA could be a novel, noninvasive biomarker for the detection of testicular epigenetic aberrations. Epigenetic information in cfsDNA related to spermatogenesis may serve to predict successful testicular sperm retrieval in NOA patients.",4.59,470

Here, we compared the clinical performance of FAM19A4 methylation analysis to cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping, separately and in combination, for >/= CIN3 detection in hrHPV-positive women participating in a prospective observational multi-center cohort study. The study population comprised hrHPV-positive women aged 18-66 years, visiting a gynecological outpatient clinic. From these women, cervical scrapes and colposcopy-directed biopsies (for histological confirmation) were obtained. Cervical scrapes were analyzed for FAM19A4 gene promoter methylation, cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping. Methylation analysis was performed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP). Sensitivities and specificities for >/= CIN3 were compared between tests. Stratified analyses were performed for variables that potentially influence marker performance. Of all 508 hrHPV-positive women, the sensitivities for >/= CIN3 of cytology, FAM19A4 methylation analysis, and cytology combined with HPV16/18 genotyping were 85.6, 75.6 and 92.2%, respectively, with corresponding specificities of 49.8, 71.1 and 29.4%, respectively. Both sensitivity and specificity of FAM19A4 methylation analysis were associated with age (p </= 0.001 each). In women >/= 30 years (n = 287), >/= CIN3 sensitivity of FAM19A4 methylation analysis was 88.3% (95%CI: 80.2-96.5) which was noninferior to that of cytology [85.5% (95%CI: 76.0-94.0)], at a significantly higher specificity [62.1% (95%CI: 55.8-68.4) compared to 47.6% (95%CI: 41.1-54.1)]. In conclusion, among hrHPV-positive women from an outpatient population aged >/= 30 years, methylation analysis of FAM19A4 is an attractive marker for the identification of women with >/= CIN3.",5.085,73

AIMS: We aimed to study the methylation status of the promoter region of Serine peptidase inhibitor/hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2 (SPINT2/HAI-2) tumor suppressor gene in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. METHODS: Methyl-specific polymerase (MSP) chain reaction was used to detect CpG methylation of the SPINT2/HAI-2 gene promoter in peripheral blood samples of 30 HCC and 50 HCV cirrhotic cases, along with 50 normal individuals. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation showed a stepwise increase in frequency from 40% in controls to 64% in HCV cirrhotics, and 66.7% in HCC cases with a significant difference among the studied groups (p=0.021). The combined patient groups had an increased risk of aberrant methylation with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.52, a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.23-5.14, and a p-value of 0.05 that became more statistically significant after adjusting for age (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.13-5.26, p-value=0.012), thereby confirming the association between HCV infection and aberrant methylation.

In female gametes transcription traversing differentially methylated regions (DMRs) is a common requirement for de novo methylation at DMRs. At the imprinted Gnas cluster oocyte specific transcription of a protein-coding transcript, Nesp, is needed for methylation of two DMRs intragenic to Nesp, namely the Nespas-Gnasxl DMR and the Exon1A DMR, thereby enabling expression of the Gnas transcript and repression of the Gnasxl transcript. On the paternal allele, Nesp is repressed, the germline DMRs are unmethylated, Gnas is repressed and Gnasxl is expressed. Using mutant mouse models, we show that on the paternal allele, ectopic transcription of Nesp traversing the intragenic Exon1A DMR (which regulates Gnas expression) results in de novo methylation of the Exon1A DMR and de-repression of Gnas just as on the maternal allele. However, unlike the maternal allele, methylation on the mutant paternal allele occurs post-fertilisation, i.e. in somatic cells. This, to our knowledge is the first example of transcript/transcription driven DNA methylation of an intragenic CpG island, in somatic tissues, suggesting that transcription driven de novo methylation is not restricted to the germline in the mouse. Additionally, Gnasxl is repressed on a paternal chromosome on which Nesp is ectopically expressed. Thus, a paternally inherited Gnas cluster showing ectopic expression of Nesp is",3.234,1172

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are encoded within the genomes of all higher eukaryotes and are of special interest where autoimmune disorders are concerned. Until recently, minimal effort has been made to identify specific HERVs associated with SLE and to explore their precise mechanism of expression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of HERVs associated with SLE and elucidate the effect of ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure on SLE-associated HERV expression in CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE. METHODS: Fifteen patients with SLE and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The mRNA expression of selected HERVs and the methylation status of the long terminal repeats (LTRs) in SLE-related HERVs in CD4+ T cells were investigated. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells treated with 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza C) and UVB were analyzed. Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and bisulfite sequencing analysis were employed. RESULTS: HERV-E mRNA expression was higher in lupus CD4+ T cells than in cells from healthy controls, whereas the mRNA expression levels of HERV-K, HERV-K10 and HERV-W were comparable in SLE patients and healthy controls. Additionally, the HERV-E mRNA expression level was positively correlated with SLE disease activity. Furthermore, the HERV-E LTR methylation level was decreased and was negatively correlated to the HERV-E mRNA expression level in lupus CD4+ T cells. Finally, lupus CD4+ T cells showed markedly decreased HERV-E LTR2C methylation levels and increased HERV-E mRNA expression after treatment with 5-aza C or UVB. CONCLUSION: HERV-E is involved in the development of SLE. HERV-E transcription may be activated via inhibition of LTR methylation in lupus CD4+ T cells.",3.419,1555

Histone modifiers, including histone methyl transferases (HMTases), have clear roles in human carcinogenesis but the extent of their functions and regulation are not well understood. The NSD family of HMTases comprised of three members (NSD1, NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1, and NSD3/WHSC1L) are oncogenes aberrantly expressed in several cancers, suggesting their potential to serve as novel therapeutic targets. However, the substrate specificity of the NSDs and the molecular mechanism of histones H3 and H4 recognition and methylation have not yet been established. RESULTS: Herein, we investigated the in vitro mechanisms of histones H3 and H4 recognition and modifications by the catalytic domain of NSD family members. In this study, we quantified in vitro mono-, di- and tri- methylations on H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, and H4K20 by the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of NSD1, NSD2 and NSD3, using histone as substrate. Next, we used a molecular modelling approach and docked 6-mer peptides H3K4 a.a. 1-7; H3K9 a.a. 5-11; H3K27 a.a. 23-29; H3K36 a.a. 32-38; H3K79 a.a. 75-81; H4K20 a.a. 16-22 with the catalytic domain of the NSDs to provide insight into lysine-marks recognition and methylation on histones H3 and H4. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the versatility of NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3 for recognizing and methylating several histone lysine marks on histones H3 and H4. Our work provides a basis to design selective and specific NSDs inhibitors.

The specific N-methylation of arginine residues is catalyzed by a small family of gene products known as protein arginine methyltransferases; however, very little is known about which arginine residues become methylated on target substrates. Here we describe a proteomics methodology that combines single-step immunoenrichment of methylated peptides with high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify endogenous arginine mono-methylation (MMA) sites. We thereby identify 1027 site-specific MMA sites on 494 human proteins, discovering numerous novel mono-methylation targets and confirming the majority of currently known MMA substrates. Nuclear RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA processing, RNA localization, transcription, and chromatin remodeling are predominantly found modified with MMA. Despite this, MMA sites prominently are located outside RNA-binding domains as compared with the proteome-wide distribution of arginine residues. Quantification of arginine methylation in cells treated with Actinomycin D uncovers strong site-specific regulation of MMA sites during transcriptional arrest. Interestingly, several MMA sites are down-regulated after a few hours of transcriptional arrest. In contrast, the corresponding di-methylation or protein expression levels are not altered, confirming that MMA sites contain regulated functions on their own. Collectively, we present a site-specific MMA data set in human cells and demonstrate for the first time that MMA is a dynamic post-translational modification regulated during transcriptional arrest by a hitherto uncharacterized arginine demethylase.",14.018,955

Methylation of the promoter-associated CpG island of GSTP1 occurs in many hormone-sensitive cancers, has been shown to be a biomarker for the early detection of cancerous lesions and has been associated with important clinical parameters, such as survival and response to treatment. In the current manuscript, we assessed the performance of several widely-used sodium bisulfite conversion-dependent methods (methylation-specific PCR, MethyLight, pyrosequencing and MALDI mass-spectrometry) for the analysis of DNA methylation patterns in the GSTP1 promoter. We observed large discordances between the results obtained by the different technologies. Cloning and sequencing of the investigated region resolved single-molecule DNA methylation patterns and identified heterogeneous DNA methylation patterns as the underlying cause of the differences. Heterogeneous DNA methylation patterns in the GSTP1 promoter constitute a major obstacle to the implementation of DNA methylation-based analysis of GSTP1 and might explain some of the contradictory findings in the analysis of the significance of GSTP1 promoter methylation in breast cancer.",1.151,1890

However, the exact role of ATM gene and its epigenetic alterations, especially promoter methylation in different grades of brain tumors, remains elusive. The current study was conducted to query possible correlations among methylation statue of ATM gene, ATM/ retinoblastoma (RB) protein expression, D1853N ATM polymorphism, telomere length (TL), and clinicopathological characteristics of various types of brain tumors. Isolated DNA from 30 fresh tissues was extracted from different types of brain tumors and two brain tissues from deceased normal healthy individuals. DNAs were treated with bisulfate sodium using DNA modification kit (Qiagen). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP-PCR) was implicated to determine the methylation status of treated DNA templates confirmed by promoter sequencing. Besides, the ATM and RB protein levels were determined by immunofluorescence (IF) assay using monoclonal mouse antihuman against ATM, P53, and RB proteins. To achieve an interactive correlation, the methylation data were statistically analyzed by considering TL and D1853N ATM polymorphism. More than 73% of the brain tumors were methylated in ATM gene promoter. There was strong correlation between ATM promoter methylation and its protein expression (p < 0.001). As a triangle, meaningful correlation was also found between methylated ATM promoter and ATM protein expression with D1853N ATM polymorphism (p = 0.01). ATM protein expression was not in line with RB protein expression while it was found to be significantly correlated with ATM promoter methylation (p = 0.01). There was significant correlation between TL neither with ATM promoter methylation nor with ATM protein expression nor with D1853N polymorphism. However, TL has shown strong correlation with patient's age and tumor grade (p = 0.01). Given the important role of cell cycle checkpoint proteins as well as RB and ATM in TL and cancer evolution, further assessment is warranted to shed more light on the pathway linking the telomere instability to tumor progression. High ATM methylation rate in brain tumor patients could open a new avenue toward early screening and cancer therapy.",5.137,357

Recently, instead of using the FokI domain, epigenetically active domains, such as TET1 and LSD1, have been combined with TAL effector domains to regulate targeted gene expression via DNA and histone demethylation. However, studies of histone methylation in the TALE system have not been performed. Therefore, in this study, we established a novel targeted regulation system with a TAL effector domain and a histone methylation domain. To construct a TALE-methylation fusion protein, we combined a TAL effector domain containing an E-Box region to act as a Snail binding site and the SET domain of EHMT 2 to allow for histone methylation. The constructed TALE-SET module (TSET) repressed the expression of E-cadherin via by increasing H3K9 dimethylation. Moreover, the cells that overexpressed TSET showed increased cell migration and invasion. This is the first phenotype-based study of targeted histone methylation by the TALE module, and this new system can be applied in new cancer therapies to reduce side effects.",6.359,321

In this study, we investigated the impact of cryoprotectant agents (CPAs) on DNA methylation patterns in spermatozoa and the consequences on embryonic development and the survival rate of progeny. Global methylation was assessed by enzymatic reactions in Colossoma macropomum spermatozoa that were cryopreserved using dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, methanol, ethyl glycol and glycerol as CPAs. Fertilization was carried out to evaluate survival rates and abnormalities in embryonic development upon treatment with each of the CPAs. Fresh semen served as the control. Our results indicated that, compared to the control group, spermatozoa cryopreservation decreased the fertilization rate and delayed embryonic development from the midblastula stage. Furthermore, spermatozoa cryopreserved in all CPAs had lower methylation levels and exhibited more delays and abnormalities during embryonic development than did fresh semen. Methanol resulted in fertilization, hatching rates and embryonic development that were closer to the control but had lower methylation levels. In conclusion, ours results show significant alterations on spermatozoa DNA methylation patterns caused by CPAs that are used in the semen cryopreservation process. DNA methylation pattern alterations affected the viability of progeny (r=0.48); however, these effects can be minimized by choosing the CPA that will compose the freezing solution.",2.47,1036

One yet unaddressed issue is whether the progression of atherosclerosis is associated with an increase in DNA methylation drift in the vascular tissue. The purpose of the study was to identify CpG methylation profiles that vary with the progression of atherosclerosis in the human aorta. METHODS: We interrogated a set of donor-matched atherosclerotic and normal aortic samples ranging from histological grade III to VII, with a high-density (>450,000 CpG sites) DNA methylation microarray. RESULTS: We detected a correlation between histological grade and intra-pair differential methylation for 1,985 autosomal CpGs, the vast majority of which drifted towards hypermethylation with lesion progression. The identified CpG loci map to genes that are regulated by known critical transcription factors involved in atherosclerosis and participate in inflammatory and immune responses. Functional relevance was corroborated by crossing the DNA methylation profiles with expression data obtained in the same human aorta sample set, by a transcriptome-wide analysis of murine atherosclerotic aortas and from available public databases. CONCLUSIONS: Our work identifies for the first time atherosclerosis progression-specific DNA methylation profiles in the vascular tissue. These findings provide potential novel markers of lesion severity and targets to counteract the progression of the atheroma.",2.873,1013

Epigenetic modification is suggested as a plausible mediating mechanism. METHODS: We used multivariable linear regression and a negative control design to examine offspring epigenome-wide DNA methylation in relation to maternal and offspring adiposity in 1018 participants. RESULTS: Compared with neonatal offspring of normal weight mothers, 28 and 1621 CpG sites were differentially methylated in offspring of obese and underweight mothers, respectively [false discovert rate (FDR)-corrected P-value < 0.05), with no overlap in the sites that maternal obesity and underweight relate to. A positive association, where higher methylation is associated with a body mass index (BMI) outside the normal range, was seen at 78.6% of the sites associated with obesity and 87.9% of the sites associated with underweight. Associations of maternal obesity with offspring methylation were stronger than associations of paternal obesity, supporting an intrauterine mechanism. There were no consistent associations of gestational weight gain with offspring DNA methylation. In general, sites that were hypermethylated in association with maternal obesity or hypomethylated in association with maternal underweight tended to be positively associated with offspring adiposity, and sites hypomethylated in association with maternal obesity or hypermethylated in association with maternal underweight tended to be inversely associated with offspring adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that both maternal obesity and, to a larger degree, underweight affect the neonatal epigenome via an intrauterine mechanism, but weight gain during pregnancy has little effect. We found some evidence that associations of maternal underweight with lower offspring adiposity and maternal obesity with greater offspring adiposity may be mediated via increased DNA methylation.",9.176,1074

Quantitative pyrosequencing analysis also showed that the S100A8 methylation level was decreased in cancer tissues (31.90%+/-13.31%) than that in the paired adjacent normal tissues (65.33%+/-3.64%, p<0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was 0.950 (p<0.01). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that hypomethylation of S100A8 was associated with shortened overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (log rank p<0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model also indicated significantly shorter OS (HR, 1.709; 95 % CI, 1.127-2.591) and PFS (HR, 1.767; 95 % CI, 1.168-2.974) were observed in the low-methylation-level group compared to the high-methylation-level group.

DNA methylation analysis was performed by using Illumina Infinium 27K arrays. Fourteen genes were selected for technical validation by pyrosequencing. Eighty-two differentially methylated genes were identified in irradiated (n = 11) versus nonirradiated (n = 19) samples (false discovery rate, FDR = 1.1%). Methylation levels in pathways belonging to the immune system were most altered after RT. Based on methylation levels before irradiation, a panel of five genes (H2AFY, CTSA, LTC4S, IL5RA and RB1) were significantly associated with clinical response (p = 0.041). Furthermore, the degree of methylation changes for 2,516 probes correlated with the given radiation dose. Within the 2,516 probes, an enrichment for pathways involved in cellular immune response, proliferation and apoptosis was identified (FDR < 5%). Here, we observed clear differences in methylation levels induced by radiation, some associated with response to treatment. Our study adds knowledge on the molecular mechanisms behind radiation response.",5.085,1083

METHODS: The presence of benign ARDs was confirmed through chest X-ray and the asbestos exposure history was obtained using a standardized questionnaire in this study, including 262 participants. Sera SMRP were measured using MESOMARK, and MSLN methylation in genomic DNA extracted from whole blood was detected by real-time methylation-specific PCR. Covariates were compared with SMRP concentrations using correlation analysis and the potential covariates affecting SMRP were determined by multiple linear regression analysis, and the distribution of methylation status was analyzed by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There was a trend toward elevation of SMRP values in healthy individuals exposed to asbestos as compared with those without asbestos exposure. The highest median level of SMRP was 1.3 nM in subjects with asbestosis, followed by cases with pleura plaque and asbestosis (1.2 nM), pleura plaque (0.9 nM), healthy subjects with occupational exposure (0.9 nM), non-occupational exposure (0.8 nM), and mixed exposure (0.8 nM). Within asbestosis cases, those with higher profusion scores had higher SMRP values than those with lower profusion scores (1.6 vs. 0.8 nM). Based on multi-regression analysis, the trend toward elevation of SMRP remained significant in subjects with occupational exposure or in those with asbestosis, as compared with healthy subjects without exposure (p < 0.01), although body mass index had an effect on SMRP (p < 0.0001). Regardless of the differences in SMRP levels among these subgroups, MSLN methylation ranged from 80.5 to 92.5 %, with no significant difference. The elevated level of SMRP in asbestosis with higher profusion scores could not be attributed to low MSLN methylation status. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the elevation of SMRP is related to asbestos exposure and benign ARDs especially for cases with high profusion scores, which is independent of MSLN methylation.",3.359,22
27249194,Evolutionary patterns of genic DNA methylation vary across land plants.,"['Takuno S', 'Ran JH', 'Gaut BS']",Nature plants,2016,"Little is known about patterns of genic DNA methylation across the plant kingdom or about the evolutionary processes that shape them. To characterize gene-body methylation (gbM) within exons, we have gathered single-base resolution methylome data that span the phylogenetic breadth of land plants. We find that a basal land plant, Marchantia polymorpha, lacks any evident signal of gbM within exons, but conifers have high levels of both CG and CHG (where H is A, C or T) methylation in expressed genes. To begin to understand the evolutionary forces that shape gbM, we first tested for correlations in methylation levels across orthologues(1,2). Genic CG methylation levels, but not CHG or CHH levels, are correlated across orthologues for species as distantly related as ferns and angiosperms. Hence, relative levels of CG methylation are a consistent property across genes, even for species that diverged  approximately 400 million years ago(3,4). In contrast, genic CHG methylation correlates with genome size, suggesting that the host epigenetic response to transposable elements also affects genes. Altogether, our data indicate that the evolutionary forces acting on DNA methylation vary substantially across species, genes and methylation contexts.",0,1776

METHODS: Fluorescence tagged miR-21 inhibitor and its negative control (NC) were transient transfected into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell, the transfection efficiency was observed using fluorescence microscopy, and the miR-21 expression level and genome DNA methylation status before and after transfection were assessed by real-time PCR and bisulfite-qMSP respectively. To investigate the regulation effect of DNA methylation on miR-21, cells were treated with 5-AZA (2.5 micromol/L) for 72 h, with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment as its negative control (NC), and the expression level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and AKT(also known as Protein Kinase B), two downstream genes of miR-21 were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of miR-21 in MCF-7 cell was significantly knocked down (P < 0.01) by miR-21 inhibitor, with the genome DNA methylation level (P < 0.05) and all the three Dnmts: Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b unregulated. In contrast, the miR-21 expression in MDA-MB-231 cell was elevated ( P < 0.01) by miR-21 inhibitor, meanwhile, down- regulated of genome DNA methylation (P < 0.05) and Dnmt3b expression, upregulation of Dnmt3a were also observed. In addition, treated with 5-AZA resulted in significant increases of miR-21 expression in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (P < 0.01), with the protein level of PTEN increased in MCF-7 cell, which was further involved in the downregulation of AKT. CONCLUSION: The regulation effects of DNA methylation by transient transfection of miR-21 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells are almost opposite, whilst the expression of miR-21 in two cell lines were all upregulated by decreased DNA methylation level and our results may provide some experimental evidences for the future development of rational therapy for different breast cancer.",0,640

 Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine",2016,"Eyelid skin tumors are the most frequent type of cancer in ophthalmology. And, eyelid squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for a large part of it. CDH1 encodes E-cadherin, a glycoprotein that plays an important part in cell-cell interaction. Loss of CDH1 function was suspected to be associated with tumorigenesis. Methylation of CDH1 promotors can alter the expression of its protein and is also considered as a contributor to various cancers. In this study, CDH1 methylation and expression profile as well as prognosis of 38 cases of eyelid SCC and the corresponding adjacent tissues were analyzed to clarify the role of CDH1 methylation in SCC carcinogenesis and prognosis. Methylation was detected by PCR, and CDH1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. We observed that CDH1 methylation is significantly correlated with decreased CDH1 protein expression in eyelid SCC patients. Patients with methylation and low expression of CDH1 are significantly associated with advanced and aggressive phenotypes. Therefore, CDH1 methylation and CDH1 expression are both independent prognostic factors for prognosis of eyelid SCC patients.",0,533

One such reaction, catalyzed by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), is a major consumer of methyl groups and utilizes as much as 40% of the SAM-derived groups to convert guanidinoacetate (GAA) to creatine. The exposure to methyl-group consuming compounds has substantially increased over the past decade that puts additional stresses on the cellular methylation potential. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether increased ingestion of a methyl-group consumer (GAA) either alone or combined with ethanol intake, plays a role in the pathogenesis of liver injury. Adult male Wistar rats were pair-fed the Lieber DeCarli control or ethanol diet in the presence or absence of GAA for 2weeks. At the end of the feeding regimen, biochemical and histological analyses were conducted. We observed that 2 weeks of GAA- or ethanol-alone treatment increases hepatic triglyceride accumulation by 4.5 and 7-fold, respectively as compared with the pair-fed controls. However, supplementing GAA in the ethanol diet produced panlobular macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis, a marked decrease in the methylation potential and a 28-fold increased triglyceride accumulation. These GAA-supplemented ethanol diet-fed rats displayed inflammatory changes and significantly increased liver toxicity compared to the other groups. In conclusion, increased methylation demand superimposed on chronic ethanol consumption causes more pronounced liver injury. Thus, alcoholic patients should be cautioned for increased dietary intake of methyl-group consuming compounds even for a short period of time.",2.706,764

Moreover, most technologies have difficulty providing information on the level of methylation at specific contiguous multi-sites, not to mention easy-to-use detection to eliminate labor-intensive procedures. We have addressed these limitations and report here a cascade strategy that combines proportion competitive quantitative PCR (PCQ-PCR) and lateral flow nucleic acid biosensor (LFNAB), resulting in accurate and easy-to-use assessment. The P16 gene with specific multi-methylated sites, a well-studied tumor suppressor gene, was used as the target DNA sequence model. First, PCQ-PCR provided amplification products with an accurate proportion of multi-methylated sites following the principle of proportionality, and double-labeled duplex DNA was synthesized. Then, a LFNAB strategy was further employed for amplified signal detection via immune affinity recognition, and the exact level of site-specific methylation could be determined by the relative intensity of the test line and internal reference line. This combination resulted in all recoveries being greater than 94%, which are pretty satisfactory recoveries in DNA methylation assessment. Moreover, the developed cascades show significantly high usability as a simple, sensitive, and low-cost tool. Therefore, as a universal platform for sensing systems for the detection of contiguous multi-sites of DNA methylation without external standards and expensive instrumentation, this PCQ-PCR-LFNAB cascade method shows great promise for the point-of-care diagnosis of cancer risk and therapeutics.",6.409,1678

METHODS: The contribution of differentially methylated genes to OA pathogenesis was assessed by bioinformatic analysis, gene expression analysis, and histopathologic severity correlation. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of >485,000 methylation sites was performed on eroded and intact cartilage from within the same joint of 24 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty for OA. Genes with differentially methylated CpG sites were analyzed to identify overrepresented gene ontologies, pathways, and upstream regulators. The messenger RNA expression of a subset of differentially methylated genes was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Histopathology was graded by modified Mankin score and correlated with DNA methylation. RESULTS: We identified 550 differentially methylated sites in OA. Most (69%) were hypomethylated and enriched among gene enhancers. We found differential methylation in genes with prior links to OA, including RUNX1, RUNX2, DLX5, FURIN, HTRA1, FGFR2, NFATC1, SNCAIP, and COL11A2. Among these, RUNX1, HTRA1, FGFR2, and COL11A2 were also differentially expressed. Furthermore, we found differential methylation in approximately one-third of known OA susceptibility genes. Among differentially methylated genes, upstream regulator analysis showed enrichment of TGFB1 (P = 4.40 x 10(-5) ) and several microRNAs including miR-128 (P = 4.48 x 10(-13) ), miR-27a (P = 4.15 x 10(-12) ), and miR-9 (P = 9.20 x 10(-10) ). Finally, we identified strong correlations between 20 CpG sites and the histologic Mankin score in OA. CONCLUSION: Our data implicate epigenetic dysregulation of a host of genes and pathways in OA, including a number of OA susceptibility genes. Furthermore, we identified correlations between CpG methylation and histologic severity in OA.",0,1693

We modeled the percentage methylation at individual CpGs as a function of MetS using linear mixed models. A Bonferroni-corrected P-value of 1.1 x 10(-7) was considered significant. Methylation at two CpG sites in CPT1A on chromosome 11 was significantly associated with MetS (P for cg00574958 = 2.6x10(-14) and P for cg17058475 = 1.2x10(-9)).

However, the biological mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Prenatal stress can impact fetal epigenetic regulation that could underlie changes in infant stress responses. It has been suggested that maternal glucocorticoids may mediate this epigenetic effect. We examined this hypothesis by determining the impact of maternal cortisol and depressive symptoms during pregnancy on infant NR3C1 and BDNF DNA methylation. Fifty-seven pregnant women were recruited during the second or third trimester. Participants self-reported depressive symptoms and salivary cortisol samples were collected diurnally and in response to a stressor. Buccal swabs for DNA extraction and DNA methylation analysis were collected from each infant at 2 months of age, and mothers were assessed for postnatal depressive symptoms. Prenatal depressive symptoms significantly predicted increased NR3C1 1F DNA methylation in male infants (beta = 2.147, P = 0.044). Prenatal depressive symptoms also significantly predicted decreased BDNF IV DNA methylation in both male and female infants (beta = -3.244, P = 0.013). No measure of maternal cortisol during pregnancy predicted infant NR3C1 1F or BDNF promoter IV DNA methylation. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of males to changes in NR3C1 DNA methylation and present novel evidence for altered BDNF IV DNA methylation in response to maternal depression during pregnancy. The lack of association between maternal cortisol and infant DNA methylation suggests that effects of maternal depression may not be mediated directly by glucocorticoids. Future studies should consider other potential mediating mechanisms in the link between maternal mood and infant outcomes.",4.78,830

METHODS: DNA methylation at promoters, exons and introns was identified by massive parallel sequencing. Gene expression was analysed by microarrays, qPCR, immunohistochemistry and western blots. RESULTS: Globally, hypomethylation of chromosomal DNA predominates in atherosclerotic plaques and two-thirds of genes showing over 2.5-fold differential in DNA methylation are up-regulated in comparison to healthy mammary arteries. The imprinted chromatin locus 14q32 was identified for the first time as an extensively hypomethylated area in atherosclerosis with highly induced expression of miR127, -136, -410, -431, -432, -433 and capillary formation-associated gene RTL1. The top 100 list of hypomethylated promoters exhibited over 1000-fold enrichment for miRNAs, many of which mapped to locus 14q32. Unexpectedly, also gene body hypermethylation was found to correlate with stimulated mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in genomic methylation were identified in atherosclerotic lesions. The most prominent gene cluster activated via hypomethylation was detected at imprinted chromosomal locus 14q32 with several clustered miRNAs that were up-regulated. These results suggest that epigenetic changes are involved in atherogenesis and may offer new potential therapeutic targets for vascular diseases.",15.203,1924

We aim to determine whether the disruption of DNA methylation patterns in the developing brain adversely affects neurobehavioral phenotypes later in life in a sex-dependent manner. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), a DNA methylation inhibitor, was administered in newborn rats from postnatal day 1 to 3. Neurobehavioral outcomes were analyzed at 3 months of age. 5-Aza treatment significantly inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity and decreased global DNA methylation levels in neonatal rat brains, resulting in asymmetric growth restriction with the increased brain to body weight ratio in both male and female rats at 14 days and 3 months of age. Compared with the saline control, 5-Aza treatment significantly improved performance of male rats on the rotarod test, and 5-Aza-treated female rats demonstrated less anxiety, less depression-like behaviors, and enhanced spatial learning performance. Of importance, neonatal 5-Aza treatment eliminated the sexually dimorphic differences in several neurobehavioral tests in adult rats. In addition, 5-Aza treatment decreased promoter methylation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and significantly increased BDNF mRNA and protein abundance in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of female rats in a sex-dependent manner. Thus, brain DNA methylation appears to be essential for sexual differentiations of the brain and neurobehavioral functions. Inhibition of DNA methylation in the developing brain of early life induces aberrant neurobehavioral profiles and disrupts sexually dimorphic neurobehavioral phenotypes in adulthood, of which altered BDNF signaling pathway may be an important mediator.",5.137,633

 Society for Neuroscience",2015,"Recent studies have suggested an association between alcoholism and DNA methylation, a mechanism that can mediate long-lasting changes in gene transcription. Here, we examined the contribution of DNA methylation to the long-term behavioral and molecular changes induced by a history of alcohol dependence. In search of mechanisms underlying persistent rather than acute dependence-induced neuroadaptations, we studied the role of DNA methylation regulating medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) gene expression and alcohol-related behaviors in rats 3 weeks into abstinence following alcohol dependence. Postdependent rats showed escalated alcohol intake, which was associated with increased DNA methylation as well as decreased expression of genes encoding synaptic proteins involved in neurotransmitter release in the mPFC. Infusion of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG108 prevented both escalation of alcohol consumption and dependence-induced downregulation of 4 of the 7 transcripts modified in postdependent rats. Specifically, RG108 treatment directly reversed both downregulation of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) gene expression and hypermethylation on CpG#5 of its first exon. Lentiviral inhibition of Syt2 expression in the mPFC increased aversion-resistant alcohol drinking, supporting a mechanistic role of Syt2 in compulsive-like behavior. Our findings identified a functional role of DNA methylation in alcohol dependence-like behavioral phenotypes and a candidate gene network that may mediate its effects. Together, these data provide novel evidence for DNA methyltransferases as potential therapeutic targets in alcoholism.",0,483

SET8 methylation of Histone H4 and p53 peptides and proteins, which were used as positive controls, was readily observed. While SET8 methylation of Numb in cells cannot be ruled out, based on our findings, more evidence is needed to support this claim.

A gene that is suspected to have a crucial role in various types of cancers is the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1). Thus, this study will analyze the ramifications of SOCS-1 promoter methylation in CRC patients. This study will also test the therapeutic effects of hypomethylation as a possible CRC therapy. METHODS: First, 97CRC patients' tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected. Next, the methylation status of the SOCS-1 promoter region was assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR); SOCS-1 protein and mRNA expression were also measured. A 48-month median follow-up period was used for the survival analysis of research participants. Lastly, to analyze the changes in cell invasion and migration in conjunction with protein and mRNA expression, the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine was applied in vitro to human CRC cells. RESULTS: The results showed increased SOCS-1 hypermethylation in CRC samples compared to controls. Methylated SOCS-1 was associated with significant suppression of SOCS-1 expression in tumors. Additionally, SOCS-1 hypermethylation was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. The study also found a poor overall survival rate to be significantly correlated with reduced expression of SOCS-1. After 5-azacytidine treatment, reduced in vitro DNA methylation and increased SOCS-1 expression were observed, and decreased cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition biomarker expression alteration were further confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: In colorectal cancer tissues, the rate of methylation in the SOCS-1 promoter region is high. Through promoter hypermethylation, the SOCS-1 gene was severely down-regulated in the CRC tissue samples, thereby revealing a plausible therapeutic target for CRC therapy.",2.023,1135

While genetic studies have linked both common and rare variants in genes involved in regulation of the complement system to increased risk of development of AMD, environmental factors, such as smoking and nutrition, can also significantly affect the risk of developing the disease and the rate of disease progression. Since epigenetics has been implicated in mediating, in part, the disease risk associated with some environmental factors, we investigated a possible epigenetic contribution to AMD. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of blood from AMD patients and controls. No differential methylation site reached genome-wide significance; however, when epigenetic changes in and around known GWAS-defined AMD risk loci were explored, we found small but significant DNA methylation differences in the blood of neovascular AMD patients near age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), a top-ranked GWAS locus preferentially associated with neovascular AMD. The methylation level of one of the CpG sites significantly correlated with the genotype of the risk SNP rs10490924, suggesting a possible epigenetic mechanism of risk. Integrating genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of retina samples with and without AMD together with blood samples, we further identified a consistent, replicable change in DNA methylation in the promoter region of protease serine 50 (PRSS50). These methylation changes may identify sites in novel genes that are susceptible to non-genetic factors known to contribute to AMD development and progression.",4.78,777

METHODS: We examined 89 patients with GEDs subcategorized by the Vienna classification - 41 category 3 (low grade) and 48 category 4 (high grade/intramucosal carcinoma) lesion. All tissue samples were evaluated for RUNX3 immunohistochemical staining and the level of LINE-1 methylation. RESULTS: The rate of negative expression of RUNX3 in category 4 lesion was significant higher than category 3 (P<0.01). LINE-1 methylation level was statistically different between category 3 and category 4 lesion (P<0.01). Between positive and negative expression of RUNX3 in GEDs, there was a significant difference of LINE-1 methylation level (P<0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of LINE-1 methylation level for diagnosis of category 4 lesion was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.76-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: LINE-1 methylation level was well correlated with the Vienna classification of GED and it had a close relationship with the negative expression of RUNX3 in category 4 lesion.

Histidine 243 lies close to the peptidyl transferase center in a functionally important region of Rpl3 designated as the basic thumb that coordinates the decoding, peptidyl transfer, and translocation steps of translation elongation. Hpm1 was recently implicated in ribosome biogenesis and translation. However, the biological role of methylation of its Rpl3 substrate has not been identified. Here we interrogate the role of Rpl3 methylation at H243 by investigating the functional impact of mutating this histidine residue to alanine (rpl3-H243A). Akin to Hpm1-deficient cells, rpl3-H243A cells accumulate 35S and 23S pre-rRNA precursors to a similar extent, confirming an important role for histidine methylation in pre-rRNA processing. In contrast, Hpm1-deficient cells but not rpl3-H243A mutants show perturbed levels of ribosomal subunits. We show that Hpm1 has multiple substrates in different subcellular fractions, suggesting that methylation of proteins other than Rpl3 may be important for controlling ribosomal subunit levels. Finally, translational fidelity assays demonstrate that like Hpm1-deficient cells, rpl3-H243A mutants have defects in translation elongation resulting in decreased translational accuracy. These data suggest that Rpl3 methylation at H243 is playing a significant role in translation elongation, likely via the basic thumb, but has little impact on ribosomal subunit levels. Hpm1 is therefore a multifunctional methyltransferase with independent roles in ribosome biogenesis and translation.",0,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DU145 cells, resistant to docetaxel and cabaxitaxel (DU145 10DRCR), were generated from cells resistant to 10 nM docetaxel (DU145 10DR). The effect of pre-treatment with 5-azacytidine was determined with regards to cabazitaxel sensitivity. Gene expression profiling was carried-out on DU145 10DR, DU145 10DRCR and DU145 10DRCR treated with 5-azacytidine. RESULTS: Pre-treatment of cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in enhanced sensitivity to cabazitaxel. Gene expression profiling identified a subset of genes that may be regulated by DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that DNA methylation of pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle regulatory genes may contribute to cabazitaxel resistance and pre-treatment with 5-azacytidine may restore sensitivity to cabazitaxel in prostate cancer cells.",1.826,601

This is largely attributed to dysregulated gene expression, although details of the changes are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To define the role of promoter methylation in adaptive vascular growth in hyperlipidemia (LDLR(-/-)ApoB(100/100)) and T2DM (IGF-II/LDLR(-/-)ApoB(100/100)) mouse models of hindlimb ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Unilateral hindlimb ischemia was induced by ligating femoral artery. Perfusion was assessed using ultrasound, and capillary and arteriole parameters were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Genome-wide methylated DNA sequencing was performed with DNA isolated from ischemic muscle, tissue macrophages (Mvarphis), and endothelial cells. Compared with the controls, hyperlipidemia and T2DM mice showed impaired perfusion recovery, which was associated with impaired angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Genome-wide proximal promoter DNA methylation analysis suggested differential patterns of methylation in Mvarphi genes in ischemic muscles. Classically activated M1-Mvarphi gene promoters, including Cfb, Serping1, and Tnfsf15, were significantly hypomethylated, whereas alternatively activated M2-Mvarphi gene promoters, including Nrp1, Cxcr4, Plxnd1, Arg1, Cdk18, and Fes, were significantly hypermethylated in Mvarphis isolated from hyperlipidemia and T2DM ischemic muscles compared with controls. These results combined with mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry showed the predominance of proinflammatory M1-Mvarphis, compared with anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic M2-Mvarphis in hyperlipidemia and T2DM ischemic muscles. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant promoter hypomethylation of genes typical for proinflammatory M1-Mvarphis and hypermethylation of anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic M2-Mvarphi genes in hyperlipidemia and T2DM ischemic muscles. Epigenetic alterations modify Mvarphi phenotype toward proinflammatory M1 as opposed to anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic, and tissue repair M2 phenotype, which may contribute to the impaired adaptive vascular growth under these pathological conditions.",11.019,841

Overnourishment of adolescent ewes generates IUGR in  approximately  50% of lambs, which subsequently exhibit increased fractional growth rates. We investigated putative epigenetic changes underlying this early postnatal phenotype by quantifying gene-specific methylation at cytosine:guanine (CpG) dinucleotides. Hepatic DNA/RNA was extracted from IUGR [eight male (M)/nine female (F)] and normal birth weight (12 M/9 F) lambs. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers targeting CpG islands in 10 genes: insulin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1, IGF2, H19, insulin receptor, growth hormone receptor, IGF receptors 1 and 2, and the glucocorticoid receptor. Using pyrosequencing, methylation status was determined by quantifying cytosine:thymine ratios at 57 CpG sites. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of IGF system genes and plasma IGF1/insulin were determined. DNA methylation was independent of IUGR status but sexual dimorphism in IGF1 methylation was evident (MF (both P<0.001). IGF1 mRNA expression correlated negatively with IGF1 methylation (r=-0.507, P=0.002) and positively with plasma IGF1 (r=0.884, P<0.001). Carcass and empty body weights were greater in males (P=0.002-0.014) and this gender difference in early body conformation was mirrored by sexual dimorphism in hepatic IGF1 DNA methylation, mRNA expression and plasma IGF1 concentrations.",0.75,1934

Although less studied than other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, the number of known methylated non-histone proteins is rapidly expanding. We have identified the p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) as a new substrate for methylation by the protein lysine methyltransferase SETD6. Our data demonstrate that SETD6 methylates PAK4 bothin vitroand at chromatin in cells. Interestingly, depletion of SETD6 in various cellular systems significantly hinders the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin target genes. PAK4 was recently shown to regulate beta-catenin signaling, and we show that SETD6 is a key mediator of this pathway. In the presence of SETD6, the physical interaction between PAK4 and beta-catenin is dramatically increased, leading to a significant increase in the transcription of beta-catenin target genes. Taken together, our results uncover a new regulatory layer of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade and provide new insight into SETD6 biology.",0,74

Tumors with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), a distinct subgroup with extensive DNA methylation, show characteristic features in the case of colorectal cancer. The relationship between TET inactivation and CIMP in colorectal cancers is not well understood. The expression level of TET family genes was compared between CIMP-positive (CIMP-P) and CIMP-negative (CIMP-N) colorectal cancers. Furthermore, DNA methylation profiling, including assessment of the TET1 gene, was assessed in colorectal cancers, as well as colon polyps. The TET1 was silenced by DNA methylation in a subset of colorectal cancers as well as cell lines, expression of which was reactivated by demethylating agent. TET1 methylation was more frequent in CIMP-P (23/55, 42%) than CIMP-N (2/113, 2%, P < 0.0001) colorectal cancers. This trend was also observed in colon polyps (CIMP-P, 16/40, 40%; CIMP-N, 2/24, 8%; P = 0.002), suggesting that TET1 methylation is an early event in CIMP tumorigenesis. TET1 methylation was significantly associated with BRAF mutation but not with hMLH1 methylation in the CIMP-P colorectal cancers. Colorectal cancers with TET1 methylation have a significantly greater number of DNA methylated genes and less pathological metastasis compared to those without TET1 methylation (P = 0.007 and 0.045, respectively). Our data suggest that TET1 methylation may contribute to the establishment of a unique pathway in respect to CIMP-mediated tumorigenesis, which may be incidental to hMLH1 methylation. In addition, our findings provide evidence that TET1 methylation may be a good biomarker for the prediction of metastasis in colorectal cancer.",4.444,368

AKR7A2 is the most abundant anthracycline reductase in hearts from donors with and without Down syndrome (DS), and its expression varies between individuals ( approximately tenfold). We investigated whether DNA methylation impacts AKR7A2 expression in hearts from donors with (n = 11) and without DS (n = 30). Linear models were used to test for associations between methylation status and cardiac AKR7A2 expression. In hearts from donors without DS, DNA methylation status at CpG site -865 correlated with AKR7A2 mRNA (Pearson's regression coefficient, r = -0.4051, P = 0.0264) and AKR7A2 protein expression (r = -0.5818, P = 0.0071). In heart tissue from donors with DS, DNA methylation status at CpG site -232 correlated with AKR7A2 protein expression (r = 0.8659, P = 0.0025). Multiple linear regression modeling revealed that methylation at several CpG sites is associated with the synthesis of cardiotoxic daunorubicinol. AKR7A2 methylation status in lymphoblastoid cell lines from donors with and without DS was examined to explore potential parallelisms between cardiac tissue and lymphoid cells. These results suggest that DNA methylation impacts AKR7A2 expression and the synthesis of cardiotoxic daunorubicinol.",1.721,859

Statistical methods leveraging the tissue-specificity of DNA methylation for deconvoluting the cellular mixture of heterogenous biospecimens offer a promising solution, however the performance of such methods depends entirely on the library of methylation markers being used for deconvolution. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm for Identifying Optimal Libraries (IDOL) that dynamically scans a candidate set of cell-specific methylation markers to find libraries that optimize the accuracy of cell fraction estimates obtained from cell mixture deconvolution. RESULTS: Application of IDOL to training set consisting of samples with both whole-blood DNA methylation data (Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadArray (HM450)) and flow cytometry measurements of cell composition revealed an optimized library comprised of 300 CpG sites. When compared existing libraries, the library identified by IDOL demonstrated significantly better overall discrimination of the entire immune cell landscape (p = 0.038), and resulted in improved discrimination of 14 out of the 15 pairs of leukocyte subtypes. Estimates of cell composition across the samples in the training set using the IDOL library were highly correlated with their respective flow cytometry measurements, with all cell-specific R (2)>0.99 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from [0.97 % to 1.33 %] across leukocyte subtypes. Independent validation of the optimized IDOL library using two additional HM450 data sets showed similarly strong prediction performance, with all cell-specific R (2)>0.90 and R M S E<4.00 %. In simulation studies, adjustments for cell composition using the IDOL library resulted in uniformly lower false positive rates compared to competing libraries, while also demonstrating an improved capacity to explain epigenome-wide variation in DNA methylation within two large publicly available HM450 data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Despite consisting of half as many CpGs compared to existing libraries for whole blood mixture deconvolution, the optimized IDOL library identified herein resulted in outstanding prediction performance across all considered data sets and demonstrated potential to improve the operating characteristics of EWAS involving adjustments for cell distribution. In addition to providing the EWAS community with an optimized library for whole blood mixture deconvolution, our work establishes a systematic and generalizable framework for the assembly of libraries that improve the accuracy of cell mixture deconvolution.",2.576,342

This study aimed to identify whether DNA methylation also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps (NP). METHODOLOGY: NP tissues were obtained from 32 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with bilateral NP. Biopsies of inferior turbinate mucosa (ITM) were taken from 18 patients who underwent rhinoseptoplasty (control group). The methylated genes, which were detected by DNA methylation microarray, were validated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, bisulphite sequencing, real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: DNA methylation microarray identified 8,008 CpG islands in 2,848 genes. One hundred and ninety-eight genes were found to have a methylated signal in the promoter region in NP samples compared with ITM samples. The four top genes that changed, COL18A1, EP300, GNAS and SMURF1, were selected for further study. The methylation frequency of COL18A1 was significantly higher in NP samples than in ITM samples. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of NP. Promoter methylation of COL18A1 was found to be significantly increased in NP tissues, further studies are necessary to confirm the significance of these epigenetic factors in the mechanisms underlying the development or persistence of NP.",3.761,191

A total of 64 CpG sites were selected as body fluid-specific marker candidates by having more than 20% discrepancy in DNA methylation status between a certain type of body fluid and other types of body fluids and to have methylation or unmethylation pattern only in a particular type of body fluid. From further locus-specific methylation analysis in additional samples, 1 to 3 CpG sites were selected for each body fluid. Then, a multiplex methylation SNaPshot reaction was constructed to analyze methylation status of 8 body fluid-specific CpG sites. The developed multiplex reaction positively identifies blood, saliva, semen and the body fluid which originates from female reproductive organ in one reaction, and produces successful DNA methylation profiles in aged or mixed samples. Although it remains to be investigated whether this approach is more sensitive, more practical than RNA- or peptide-based assays and whether it can be successfully applied to forensic casework, the results of the present study will be useful for the forensic investigators dealing with body fluid samples.",4.604,302

MicroRNA-124a (miR - 124a) is known to have tumor-suppressive function and be methylation-silenced during exposure to chronic inflammation. AIM: We analyzed whether higher methylation levels of miR-124a genes correlated with the higher epidemiologic risk of CAC development in UC patients. METHODS: Forty UC patients without CAC, four patients with CAC or dysplasia, eight sporadic colorectal cancer (S-CRC) patients, and 12 healthy volunteers (HV) were studied. Methylation status of miR-124a genes (miR-124a-1, -2, and -3) was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), and methylation levels were quantified by real-time MSP. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a target of miR-124a, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Three miR-124a genes were methylated in all neoplastic tissues (CAC, dysplasia, and S-CRC), and CDK6 was highly expressed in those tissues. Regarding disease extent, mean methylation levels of miR-124a-3 in HV, non-pancolitis, and pancolitis were 2.0, 5.3, and 12.3%, respectively, and were significantly higher in pancolitis than in HV (p < 0.01). Regarding disease duration, mean methylation levels in short-term and long-standing UC patients were 2.5 and 13.2%, respectively. Long-standing UC patients had significantly higher methylation levels than HV (p < 0.01). Moreover, UC patients with both pancolitis and long-standing had 7.4-fold higher methylation levels than those without these risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-124a genes are methylated during carcinogenesis in UC patients. The methylation level of miR-124a-3 is a promising marker for estimating individual risk for CAC.",2.613,1717

DNA methylation status in the four cases, which all harbor a MLL3 germline mutation, differed from that of the normal control, and hypermethylation was more prevalent. Also, more CpG sites were hypermethylated in the acute-phase AML patient than in the AML patient in remission. Fifty-nine hyper- or hypomethylated genes were identified as common to all four cases. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that differentially methylated sites among acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma cases and the control were in both promoters (CpG island) and gene body regions (shelf/shore areas). Hypermethylation was more prevalent in cancer cases. The study supports the suggestion that the level of DNA methylation changes in AML progression.",0,908

However, substantial experimental evidence from the past decade indicates that this simple model needs to be revised. DNA methylation can be described by a dynamic stochastic model, in which DNA methylation at each site is determined by the local activity of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), DNA demethylases, and the DNA replication rate. Through the targeting and regulation of these enzymes, DNA methylation is controlled by the network of chromatin marks.",11.227,1805

Aberrant methylation may be an early event in carcinogenesis, but whether PAHs influence the epigenome is unclear, particularly in breast tissue where methylation may be most relevant. We aimed to evaluate the role of methylation in the association between PAHs and breast cancer. METHODS: In a population-based case-control study, we measured promoter methylation of 13 breast cancer-related genes in breast tumor tissue (n=765-851 cases) and global methylation in peripheral blood (1055 cases/1101 controls). PAH sources (current active smoking, residential environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), vehicular traffic, synthetic log burning, and grilled/smoked meat intake) were evaluated separately. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: When comparing methylated versus unmethylated genes, synthetic log use was associated with increased ORs for CDH1 (OR=2.26, 95%CI=1.06-4.79), HIN1 (OR=2.14, 95%CI=1.34-3.42) and RARbeta (OR=1.80, 95%CI=1.16-2.78) and decreased ORs for BRCA1 (OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.30-0.66). Residential ETS was associated with decreased ORs for ESR1 (OR=0.74, 95%CI=0.56-0.99) and CCND2 methylation (OR=0.65, 95%CI=0.44-0.96). Current smoking and vehicular traffic were associated with decreased ORs for DAPK (OR=0.53, 95%CI=0.28-0.99) and increased ORs for TWIST1 methylation (OR=2.79, 95%CI=1.24-6.30), respectively. In controls, synthetic log use was inversely associated with LINE-1 (OR=0.59, 95%CI=0.41-0.86). DISCUSSION: PAH sources were associated with hypo- and hypermethylation at multiple promoter regions in breast tumors and LINE-1 hypomethylation in blood of controls.

The analytical problem is the fact that the biological material has been very often exposed to detrimental exogenous influences. Thereby, the molecular substrates used for the identification of the traces may become degraded. So far, most protocols utilize cell specific proteins or RNAs. Instead of measuring these more sensitive compounds this paper describes the application of the differential DNA-methylation. As a result of two genome wide screenings with the Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChips 27 and 450k we identified 150 candidate loci revealing differential methylation with regard to the body fluids venous blood, menstrual blood, vaginal fluid, saliva and sperm. Among them we selected 9 loci as the most promising markers. For the final determination of the methylation degree we applied the SNuPE-method. Because the degree of methylation might be modified by various endogenous and exogenous factors, we tested each marker with approximately 100 samples of each target fluid in a validation study. The stability of the detection procedure is proved in various simulated forensic surroundings according to standardized conditions. We studied the potential influence of 12 relatively common tumors on the methylation of the 9 markers. For this purpose the target fluids of 34 patients have been analysed. Only the cervix carcinoma might have an remarkable effect because impairing the signal of both vaginal markers. Using the Illumina MiSeq device we tested the potential influence of cis acting sequence variants on the methylation degree of the 9 markers in the specific body fluid DNA of 50 individuals. For 4 marker loci we observed such an influence either by sole SNPs or haplotypes. The identification of each target fluid is possible in arbitrary mixtures with the remaining four body fluids. The sensitivity of the individual body fluid tests is in the same range as for the forensic STR-analysis. It is the first forensic body fluid protocol which considers the exogenic and endogenic parameters potentially interfering with the true results.",3.234,265

The type 2 cytokine IL-13 is a key mediator of allergic airway diseases, such as asthma, and is up-regulated in response to many asthma-promoting exposures. OBJECTIVES: To directly study the epigenetic response of airway epithelial cells (AECs) to IL-13 and test whether IL-13-induced epigenetic changes differ between individuals with and without asthma. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns were studied in 58 IL-13-treated and untreated primary AEC cultures and validated in freshly isolated cells of subjects with and without asthma using the Illumina Human Methylation 450K and HumanHT-12 BeadChips. IL-13-mediated comethylation modules were identified and correlated with clinical phenotypes using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: IL-13 altered global DNA methylation patterns in cultured AECs and were significantly enriched near genes associated with asthma. Importantly, a significant proportion of this IL-13 epigenetic signature was validated in freshly isolated AECs from subjects with asthma and clustered into two distinct modules, with module 1 correlated with asthma severity and lung function and module 2 with eosinophilia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a single exposure of IL-13 may selectively induce long-lasting DNA methylation changes in asthmatic airways that alter specific AEC pathways and contribute to asthma phenotypes.",12.996,894

Promoter DNA methylation of CRAT, iNOS, OGG1 and GCR in blood leukocytes was measured using pyrosequencing. We used Cox regression models to examine prospective associations between cancer incidence and both methylation at the baseline visit and methylation rate of changes over time. Baseline OGG1 methylation was associated with higher risk of all-cancer (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.15-1.78) and prostate cancer (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03-2.25) incidence. Compared with participants remaining cancer-free, those who eventually developed cancer had significantly accelerated CRAT methylation (p = 0.04) and decelerated iNOS methylation (p<0.01) over time prior to cancer diagnosis. Accelerated CRAT methylation was associated with higher all-cancer incidence (HR: 3.88, 95% CI: 1.06-14.30), whereas accelerated iNOS methylation was associated with lower all-cancer incidence (HR: 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.38).

In this review, we surveyed major methylation assays, along with comparisons and biological examples, to provide an overview of DNA methylation profiling techniques. The advances in microarray and sequencing technologies make genome-wide profiling possible at a single-nucleotide or even a single-cell resolution. These profiling approaches vary in many aspects, such as DNA input, resolution, genomic region coverage, and bioinformatics analysis, and selecting a feasible method requires knowledge of these methods. We first introduce the biological background of DNA methylation and its pattern in plants, animals and fungi. We present an overview of major experimental approaches to profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and then extend to the single-cell methylome. To evaluate these methods, we outline their strengths and weaknesses and perform comparisons across the different platforms. Due to the increasing need to compute high-throughput epigenomic data, we interrogate the computational pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data and also discuss the concept of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs).

However, an aspect that did not receive much attention is the evolution of epigenetic changes with time since smoking cessation. We conducted a series of epigenome-wide association studies to capture the dynamics of smoking-induced epigenetic changes after smoking cessation, using genome-wide methylation profiles obtained from blood samples in 745 women from 2 European populations. Two distinct classes of CpG sites were identified: sites whose methylation reverts to levels typical of never smokers within decades after smoking cessation, and sites remaining differentially methylated, even more than 35 years after smoking cessation. Our results suggest that the dynamics of methylation changes following smoking cessation are driven by a differential and site-specific magnitude of the smoking-induced alterations (with persistent sites being most affected) irrespective of the intensity and duration of smoking. Analyses of the link between methylation and expression levels revealed that methylation predominantly and remotely down-regulates gene expression. Among genes whose expression was associated with our candidate CpG sites, LRRN3 appeared to be particularly interesting as it was one of the few genes whose methylation and expression were directly associated, and the only gene in which both methylation and gene expression were found associated with smoking. Our study highlights persistent epigenetic markers of smoking, which can potentially be detected decades after cessation. Such historical signatures are promising biomarkers to refine individual risk profiling of smoking-induced chronic disease such as lung cancer.",6.393,705
26181301,Aberrant DNA Methylation of Phosphodiesterase [corrected] 4D Alters Airway Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypes.,"['Lin AH', 'Shang Y', 'Mitzner W', 'Sham JS', 'Tang WY']",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2016,"Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a hallmark feature in asthma characterized by exaggerated airway contractile response to stimuli due to increased airway sensitivity and chronic airway remodeling. We have previously shown that allergen-induced AHR in mice is associated with aberrant DNA methylation in the lung genome, suggesting that AHR could be epigenetically regulated, and these changes might predispose the animals to asthma. Previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) is associated with increased AHR. However, epigenetic regulation of this gene in asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) has not been examined. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between epigenetic regulation of PDE4D and ASMC phenotypes. We identified CpG site-specific hypomethylation at PDE4D promoter in human asthmatic ASMCs. We next used methylated oligonucleotides to introduce CpG site-specific methylation at PDE4D promoter and examined its effect on ASMCs. We showed that PDE4D methylation decreased cell proliferation and migration of asthmatic ASMCs. We further elucidated that methylated PDE4D decreased PDE4D expression in asthmatic ASMCs, increased cAMP level, and inhibited the aberrant increase in Ca(2+) level. Moreover, PDE4D methylation reduced the phosphorylation level of downstream effectors of Ca(2+) signaling, including myosin light chain kinase and p38. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that gene-specific epigenetic changes may predispose ASMCs to asthma through alterations in cell phenotypes. Modulation of ASMC phenotypes by methylated PDE4D oligonucleotides can reverse the aberrant ASMC functions to normal phenotypes. This has provided new insight to the development of novel therapeutic options for this debilitative disease.",3.985,263

 health",2015,"A growing body of research has implicated DNA methylation as a potential mediator of the effects of maternal smoking in pregnancy on offspring ill-health. Data were available from a UK birth cohort of children with DNA methylation measured at birth, age 7 and 17. One issue when analysing genome-wide DNA methylation data is the correlation of methylation levels between CpG sites, though this can be crudely bypassed using a data reduction method. In this manuscript we investigate the effect of sustained maternal smoking in pregnancy on longitudinal DNA methylation in their offspring using a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model. This model avoids the data reduction used in previous analyses. Four of the 28 previously identified, smoking related CpG sites were shown to have offspring methylation related to maternal smoking using this method, replicating findings in well-known smoking related genes MYO1G and GFI1. Further weak associations were found at the AHRR and CYP1A1 loci. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the utility of the Bayesian mixture model method for investigation of longitudinal DNA methylation data and this method should be considered for use in whole genome applications.",2.063,131

A single learning event can induce a variety of DNA modifications within the neuronal genome, some of which may be common to all individuals experiencing the event, whereas others may occur in a subset of individuals. Variations in experience-induced DNA methylation may subsequently confer increased vulnerability or resilience to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the detection of experience-dependent changes in DNA methylation in the brain has been hindered by the interrogation of heterogeneous cell populations, regional differences in epigenetic states and the use of pooled tissue obtained from multiple individuals. Methyl CpG Binding Domain Ultra-Sequencing (MBD Ultra-Seq) overcomes current limitations on genome-wide epigenetic profiling by incorporating fluorescence-activated cell sorting and sample-specific barcoding to examine cell-type-specific CpG methylation in discrete brain regions of individuals. We demonstrate the value of this method by characterizing differences in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in neurons and non-neurons of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of individual adult C57BL/6 mice, using as little as 50 ng of genomic DNA per sample. We find that the neuronal methylome is characterized by greater CpG methylation as well as the enrichment of 5mC within intergenic loci. In conclusion, MBD Ultra-Seq is a robust method for detecting DNA methylation in neurons derived from discrete brain regions of individual animals. This protocol will facilitate the detection of experience-dependent changes in DNA methylation in a variety of behavioural paradigms and help identify aberrant experience-induced DNA methylation that may underlie risk and resiliency to neuropsychiatric disease.",3.661,1463

Consequently, it is essential to search for new biomarkers that can improve the prediction of T2D. The aim of this study was to examine whether 5 DNA methylation loci in blood DNA (ABCG1, PHOSPHO1, SOCS3, SREBF1, and TXNIP), recently reported to be associated with T2D, might predict future T2D in subjects from the Botnia prospective study. We also tested if these CpG sites exhibit altered DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets, liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle from diabetic vs. non-diabetic subjects. DNA methylation at the ABCG1 locus cg06500161 in blood DNA was associated with an increased risk for future T2D (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16, P-value = 0.007, Q-value = 0.018), while DNA methylation at the PHOSPHO1 locus cg02650017 in blood DNA was associated with a decreased risk for future T2D (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95, P-value = 0.006, Q-value = 0.018) after adjustment for age, gender, fasting glucose, and family relation. Furthermore, the level of DNA methylation at the ABCG1 locus cg06500161 in blood DNA correlated positively with BMI, HbA1c, fasting insulin, and triglyceride levels, and was increased in adipose tissue and blood from the diabetic twin among monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. DNA methylation at the PHOSPHO1 locus cg02650017 in blood correlated positively with HDL levels, and was decreased in skeletal muscle from diabetic vs. non-diabetic monozygotic twins.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has the highest incidence in Southern China. Aberrant methylation at the promoter region of tumor suppressors is frequently reported in NPC; however, genome-wide methylation changes have not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, we systematically analyzed methylome data in 25 primary NPC tumors and nontumor counterparts using a high-throughput approach with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Comparatively, we examined the methylome data of 11 types of solid tumors collected by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In NPC, the hypermethylation pattern was more dominant than hypomethylation and the majority of de novo methylated loci were within or close to CpG islands in tumors. The comparative methylome analysis reveals hypermethylation at chromosome 6p21.3 frequently occurred in NPC (false discovery rate; FDR=1.33 x 10(-9) ), but was less obvious in other types of solid tumors except for prostate and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancer (FDR<10(-3) ). Bisulfite pyrosequencing results further confirmed the aberrant methylation at 6p in an additional patient cohort. Evident enrichment of the repressive mark H3K27me3 and active mark H3K4me3 derived from human embryonic stem cells were found at these regions, indicating both DNA methylation and histone modification function together, leading to epigenetic deregulation in NPC. Our study highlights the importance of epigenetic deregulation in NPC. Polycomb Complex 2 (PRC2), responsible for H3K27 trimethylation, is a promising therapeutic target. A key genomic region on 6p with aberrant methylation was identified. This region contains several important genes having potential use as biomarkers for NPC detection.",2.5,31
25539843,Quantification of epigenetic biomarkers: an evaluation of established and emerging methods for DNA methylation analysis.,"['Redshaw N', 'Huggett JF', 'Taylor MS', 'Foy CA', 'Devonshire AS']",BMC genomics,2014,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in several human diseases, most notably cancer. The quantitative analysis of DNA methylation patterns has the potential to serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, however, there is currently a lack of consensus regarding the optimal methodologies to quantify methylation status. To address this issue we compared five analytical methods: (i) MethyLight qPCR, (ii) MethyLight digital PCR (dPCR), methylation-sensitive and -dependent restriction enzyme (MSRE/MDRE) digestion followed by (iii) qPCR or (iv) dPCR, and (v) bisulfite amplicon next generation sequencing (NGS). The techniques were evaluated for linearity, accuracy and precision. RESULTS: MethyLight qPCR displayed the best linearity across the range of tested samples. Observed methylation measured by MethyLight- and MSRE/MDRE-qPCR and -dPCR were not significantly different to expected values whilst bisulfite amplicon NGS analysis over-estimated methylation content. Bisulfite amplicon NGS showed good precision, whilst the lower precision of qPCR and dPCR analysis precluded discrimination of differences of < 25% in methylation status. A novel dPCR MethyLight assay is also described as a potential method for absolute quantification that simultaneously measures both sense and antisense DNA strands following bisulfite treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings comprise a comprehensive benchmark for the quantitative accuracy of key methods for methylation analysis and demonstrate their applicability to the quantification of circulating tumour DNA biomarkers by using sample concentrations that are representative of typical clinical isolates.",3.986,1371

Glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) regulates many biological processes, including stress response, behavioral, cardiometabolic and immunologic functions. Genetic variants in NR3C1 have been associated with atherosclerosis and related risk factors. This study investigated the association of NR3C1 promoter methylation with FMD, independent of genetic and family-level environmental factors. METHODS: We studied 84 middle-aged, male-male monozygotic twin pairs recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Brachial artery FMD was measured by ultrasound. DNA methylation levels at 22 CpG residues in the NR3C1 exon 1F promoter region were quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing in genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. Co-twin control analyses were conducted to examine the association of methylation variation with FMD, adjusting for smoking, physical activity, body mass index, lipids, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and depressive symptoms. Multiple testing was corrected using the false discovery rate. RESULTS: Mean methylation level across the 22 studied CpG sites was 2.02%. Methylation alterations at 12 out of the 22 CpG residues were significantly associated with FMD. On average, a 1% increase in the intra-pair difference in mean DNA methylation was associated with 2.83% increase in the intra-pair difference in FMD (95% CI: 1.46-4.20; P < 0.0001) after adjusting for risk factors and multiple testing. CONCLUSION: Methylation variation in NR3C1 exon 1F promoter significantly influences subclinical atherosclerosis, independent of genetic, early family environmental and other risk factors.",3.994,206

To date, no therapeutic can effectively solve these problems. They are complex diseases characterized by both genetic and environmental factors. DNA methylation can act as a downstream effector of environmental signals and account for multi-factorial nature of the disease. Global DNA methylation of peripheral blood cells has recently been proposed as a potential biomarker for disease risk. Alu elements host one-quarter of CpG dinucelotides in the genome to function as proxies for global DNA methylation. In this study, we evaluated the Alu methylation in the peripheral blood DNA of healthy volunteers and AUD patients using the pyrosequencing technology. The Alu methylation level is significantly higher in AUD compared to healthy controls (23.4 +/- 1.6 versus 22.1 +/- 1.0, t = 7.83, p < 0.0001). Moreover, significant correlation was found between Alu methylation and alcohol use disorders identification test score (r = 0.250, p < 0.0001), alcohol problem (r = 0.294, p < 0.0001), and life position (r = -0.205, p = 0.0005). Overall, these novel findings indicate that alcohol-related increase in Alu methylation might play a complex role in the etiology and pathogenesis of AUD. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship.",0,1308

One mechanism by which smoking (and other environmental factors) might have long-lasting effects is through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. OBJECTIVES: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) investigating alterations in DNA methylation in infants exposed in utero to maternal tobacco smoke, using the Norway Facial Clefts Study. METHODS: The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to assess DNA methylation in whole blood from 889 infants shortly after delivery. Of 889 mothers, 287 reported smoking-twice as many smokers as in any previous EWAS of maternal smoking. CpG sites related to maternal smoking during the first trimester were identified using robust linear regression. RESULTS: We identified 185 CpGs with altered methylation in infants of smokers at genome-wide significance (q-value < 0.05; mean Deltabeta = +/- 2%). These correspond to 110 gene regions, of which 7 have been previously reported and 10 are newly confirmed using publicly available results. Among these 10, the most noteworthy are FRMD4A, ATP9A, GALNT2, and MEG3, implicated in processes related to nicotine dependence, smoking cessation, and placental and embryonic development. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified 10 genes with newly established links to maternal smoking. Further, we note differences between smoking-related methylation changes in newborns and adults, suggesting possible distinct effects of direct versus indirect tobacco smoke exposure as well as potential differences due to age. Further work would be needed to determine whether these small changes in DNA methylation are biologically or clinically relevant. The methylation changes identified in newborns may mediate the association between in utero maternal smoking exposure and later health outcomes.",7.977,1695

The role of a new lncRNA LOC100130476 in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) has remained unknown. The present study investigated the role and methylation status of LOC100130476 in the pathogenesis of GCA, and further evaluated the potential prognostic role of LOC100130476 in GCA. Significant downregulation of LOC100130476 was detected in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cell lines and primary GCA tissues. Methylation frequency of LOC100130476 was gradually increased from exon 1 to exon 2 both in tumor tissues and corresponding normal tissues; however, methylation status of region 1 closing to the transcription start site was more tumor-specific among the three regions examined. The findings of the association between LOC100130476 expression, methylation and TNM stage, pathological differentiation, and GCA patients' survival further identified the role of LOC100130476 as a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, the hypermethylation of LOC100130476 was also detected in peripheral white blood cells of GCA cases. Thus, LOC100130476 may be act as a tumor suppressor gene in GCA carcinogenesis and aberrant methylation at the CpG sites near the transcription start site within exon 1 may be critical for gene silencing. In addition, aberrant methylation of LOC100130476 in peripheral white blood cells and GCA tissues may be used as a potential valuable biomarker in GCA diagnosis and prognosis.",3.491,1057

NDRG1 expression in cancer cells is generally low, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Aberrant methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) in gene promoter was able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes, disordering cell proliferation and apoptosis, playing a promotion role in tumor occurrence and progression. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of epigenetic modification of NDRG1 on prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The protein expression in human specimens was measured by immunohistochemical staining. The expression level of NDRG1 was changed by plasmid vectors in PCa cells. These cells were used to study proliferation and invasiveness. NDRG1 expression in normal prostate cells was higher than that in PCa cells. Downregulation of NDRG1 expression enhanced cell proliferation and invasiveness. In contrast, its upregulation could reduce cell proliferation and invasiveness. In PCa cells, the methylation rate of CGIs in the promoter region of NDRG1 was higher than that in normal prostate cells. 5-Aza-CdR, a methylation inhibitor, was able to effectively reverse the aberrant methylation of NDRG1, enhancing its expression, inhibiting cell growth. NDRG1 can inhibit the cell proliferation and invasion of PCa, but its expression level is low. The aberrant methylation of NDRG1 promoter is an important mechanism for gene silencing, playing an important role in tumor occurrence and progression. Therefore, reversing the aberrant methylation of NDRG1 may be used for PCa treatment.",3.025,515

This study aimed to determine the expression of TCF21 mRNA and protein in gastric cancer cell lines and tissue specimens and then investigate the prognostic impact of TCF21 expression in gastric cancer and analyze the relationship between TCF21 expression and methylation level. METHODS: We used real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of TCF21 and used methylation-specific-PCR to determine the methylation status of TCF21 in gastric cancer samples and gastric cancer cell lines. RESULTS: The results showed that TCF21 expression level in gastric cancer samples was significantly lower than in normal adjacent tissue samples. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that TCF21 was a significant prognosticator of cancer-specific survival (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the methylation level of TCF21 in gastric cancer samples was much higher than the samples in normal adjacent tissue. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine can upregulate the expression of TCF21 in gastric cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the low expression of TCF21 was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with gastric cancer. Aberrant methylation was an important reason for the downregulation of TCF21 and may be associated with tumorigenesis in gastric cancer.",3.081,1985

This study analyzed the methylation profiles of P1, P2 and E1 regions of the gene to identify the region of which methylation most specifically corresponds to HCC and to evaluate the potential of this methylated region as a biomarker in urine for HCC screening. METHODS: Bisulfite DNA sequencing and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to compare methylation of the 56 CpG sites in regions P1, P2 and E1 in DNA isolated from normal, hepatitic, cirrhotic, adjacent non-HCC, and HCC liver tissue and urine samples for the characterization of hypermethylation of the RASSF1A gene as a biomarker for HCC screening. RESULTS: In tissue, comparing HCC (n = 120) with cirrhosis and hepatitis together (n = 70), methylation of P1 had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.90, whereas methylation of E1 and P2 had AUROC of 0.84 and 0.72, respectively. At 90% sensitivity, specificity for P1 methylation was 72.9% versus 38.6% for E1 and 27.1% for P2. Methylated P1 DNA was detected in urine in association with cirrhosis and HCC. It had a sensitivity of 81.8% for alpha-fetoprotein negative HCC.

The incidence of glioma worldwide is about 6-12 per 100,000. Recently, several studies showed that the activation of the oncogenes and the inactivation and/or loss of the tumor suppressor genes, especially for miRNA-21, let-7 and so on, are the most primary molecule event in gliomas. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenously expressed small noncoding RNAs which are usually 21-23 nucleotides long. miRNAs regulate gene expression and play important roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. To date, Growing evidence has shown that mi RNAs are frequently dysregulated in human cancers and can act as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Along with the discovery of micro RNA, more and more research focusing on its relationship with glioma was carried out to investigate the biological features of glioma and to provide experimental evidence for glioma mechanism. In the present study, we aimed to verify the miRNA-126 down-regulation which showed in the results of glioma tissue miRNAs chip and discuss the miRNA-126 methylation in patients with glioma. A total of 50 samples from patients with glioma and 20 control samples from patients with cerebral trauma were included in this study. The expression levels of the miR-126 gene were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the methylation status of miR-126 was examined using methylation-specific PCR-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (MSP-DHPLC). The expression level of miRNA-126 was found to be significantly higher in the control group (0.6134 +/- 0.1214) than in the glioma group (0.2771 +/- 0.1529; P < 0.05). The expression was also significantly elevated in low-grade gliomas (0.3117 +/- 0.1474) compared with high-grade gliomas (0.1582 +/- 0.1345; P < 0.05). In addition, increased methylation of miR-126 was found in 40% of glioma patients in our study (20/50 cases), resulting in significantly decreased miR-126 expression (0.1715 +/- 0.1376; P < 0.05). Our results indicate that we verified successfully the miRNA-126 down-regulation phenomenon in patients with glioma which showed in the results of glioma tissue miRNAs chip and the miRNA-126 down-regulation through methylation in patients with glioma. So we could say that epigenetic modification is a crucial mechanism for controlling the expression of miR-126 in glioma.",1.977,1963

We investigated the relationships of methylation markers with both cotinine, an established marker of internal smoking exposure, and self-reported smoking. METHODS: Blood DNA methylation levels across the genome and serum cotinine were measured in 1000 older adults aged 50-75 years. Epigenome-wide scans were performed to identify methylation markers associated with cotinine. The inter-dose-response relationships between the number of cigarettes smoked per day, cotinine concentration, and DNA methylation were modeled by restricted cubic spline regression. RESULTS: Of 61 CpGs that passed the genome-wide significance threshold (p<1.13x10(-7)), 40 CpGs in 25 chromosomal regions were successfully replicated, showing 0.2-3% demethylation per 10ng/ml increases in cotinine. The strongest associations were observed for several loci at AHRR, F2RL3, 2q37.1, 6p21.33, and GFI1 that were previously identified to be related to self-reported smoking. One locus at RAB34 was newly discovered. Both cotinine and methylation markers exhibited non-linear relationships with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, where the highest rates of increase in cotinine and decreases in methylation were observed at low smoking intensity (1-15 cigarettes/day) and plateaued at high smoking intensity (>15-20 cigarettes/day). A clear linear relationship was observed between cotinine concentration and methylation level. Both cotinine and methylation markers showed similar accuracy in distinguishing current from never smoker, but only methylation markers distinguished former from never smoker with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study corroborates and expands the list of smoking-associated DNA methylation markers. Methylation levels were linearly related to cotinine concentration and provided accurate measures for both current and past smoking exposure.",4.373,47

Sediment was sampled under different depths and in mangrove regions with different plant covers and salinities. All samples were incubated with (203)Hg and MM(203)Hg was extracted and measured by liquid scintillation. MMHg was formed in all samples and sites tested including plant roots and litter. Higher Hg methylation was found in the superficial fraction of sediments (0.47-7.82%). Infralittoral sandy sediment had low MMHg formation (0.44-1.61%). Sediment under Rhizophora mangle had lower MMHg formation (0.018-2.23%) than under A. shaueriana (0.2-4.63%) and Laguncularia racemosa (0.08-7.82). MMHg formation in sediment tended to increase with salinity but the differences were not significant. Therefore, MMHg formation occurs in different sites of mangrove ecosystems and may be an important threat that requires further study.",3.34,730

Since aberrant promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) is widely considered to be an important epigenetic change in early carcinogenesis, this study identified a panel of methylation markers for early detection of NPC and also assessed the clinical usefulness of these markers with noninvasive plasma specimens instead of biopsies. MS-HRM assays were carried out to assess the methylation status of a selected panel of four TSGs (RASSF1A, WIF1, DAPK1 and RARbeta2) in biopsies, NP brushings and cell-free plasma from NPC patients. High-risk and cancer-free groups were used as controls. DNA methylation panel showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EBV DNA marker in cell-free plasma from NPC patients at early Stages (I and II) and in addition to the EBV DNA marker, MS-HRM test for plasma and NP brushing DNA methylation significantly increased the detection rate at all NPC stages as well as local recurrence, using this selected four-gene panel (p<0.05). MS-HRM assay on a selected gene panel has great potential to become a noninvasive and complementary test for NPC early and recurrent detection in combination with the EBV DNA test to increase the sensitivity for NPC detection at an early stage.",5.085,1557

De novo methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region is an epigenetic hallmark of gene silencing in cancer. Although the CTCF/cohesin complex preferentially targets hypomethylated DNA, it remains unclear whether the CTCF/cohesin-mediated high-order chromatin structure is affected by DNA methylation during tumorigenesis. We found that DNA methylation downregulates the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is an inducible, rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis, by disrupting CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping. We show that the CTCF/cohesin complex is enriched near a CpG island associated with PTGS2 and that the PTGS2 locus forms chromatin loops through methylation-sensitive binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex. DNA methylation abolishes the association of the CTCF/cohesin complex with the PTGS2 CpG island. Disruption of chromatin looping by DNA methylation abrogates the enrichment of transcriptional components, such as positive elongation factor b, at the transcriptional start site of the PTGS2 locus. These alterations result in the downregulation of PTGS2. Our results provide evidence that CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping of the PTGS2 locus is dynamically influenced by the DNA methylation status.",8.459,235

METHODS: Three batches of primary culture TM cells were treated with and without 100 nM dexamethasone (DEX) for 14 days. Genome-wide methylation analysis was done using Illumina 450 K methylation chips. The gene expression profile of the TM cells also was examined. The epigenetic effect of DEX stimulation on gene expression in TM cells was further verified by treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and subsequent real-time PCR analysis. RESULTS: After DEX stimulation, we found demethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within the FKBP5, ZBTB16, and SCNN1A gene promoter regions with increases of corresponding gene expression for all three TM batches, and methylated CpG sites within the ARSI, HIC1, GREM2, and MATN2 gene promoter regions with decreases of corresponding of gene expression for all three batches. Inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-aza-dC treatment induced a further increase of FKBP5 and SCNN1A mRNA expression under DEX stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The DEX stimulation induces alteration of the DNA methylation status in human TM cells. Epigenetic modification could affect the TM gene expression profile.",3.404,1420

Genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation are two well-studied sources of allele-specific methylation (ASM), but recent research has indicated a more complex pattern in which genotypic variation can be associated with allelically-skewed DNA methylation in cis. Given the known heterogeneity of DNA methylation across tissues and cell types we explored inter- and intra-individual variation in ASM across several regions of the human brain and whole blood from multiple individuals. Consistent with previous studies, we find widespread ASM with > 4% of the  approximately 220,000 loci interrogated showing evidence of allelically-skewed DNA methylation. We identify ASM flanking known imprinted regions, and show that ASM sites are enriched in DNase I hypersensitivity sites and often located in an extended genomic context of intermediate DNA methylation. We also detect examples of genotype-driven ASM, some of which are tissue-specific. These findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of differential DNA methylation across tissues and have important implications for genetic studies of complex disease.

27508170,DNA methylation changes and TE activity induced in tissue cultures of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).,"['Orlowska R', 'Machczynska J', 'Oleszczuk S', 'Zimny J', 'Bednarek PT']","Journal of biological research (Thessalonike, Greece)",2016,"BACKGROUND: In vitro plant regeneration via androgenesis or somatic embryogenesis is capable of inducing (epi)mutations that may affect sexual progenies. While epimutations are associated with DNA methylation, mutations could be due to the movement of transposons. The common notion is that both processes are linked. It is being assumed that demethylation activates transposable elements (TEs). Analysis of methylation changes and their relation with TEs activation in tissue cultures requires uniquely derived donor plants (Ds), their regenerants (Rs) and respective progeny (Ps) that would allow discrimination of processes not related to changes introduced via in vitro cultures. Moreover, a set of methods (RP-HPLC, SSAP, and MSTD) is needed to study whether different TEs families are being activated during in vitro tissue culture plant regeneration and whether their activity could be linked to DNA methylation changes or alternative explanations should be considered. RESULTS: The in vitro tissue culture plant regeneration in barley was responsible for the induction of DNA methylation in regenerants and conservation of the methylation level in the progeny as shown by the RP-HPLC approach. No difference between andro- and embryo-derived Rs and Ps was observed. The SSAP and MSTD approach revealed that Ds and Rs were more polymorphic than Ps. Moreover, Rs individuals exhibited more polymorphisms with the MSTD than SSAP approach. The differences between Ds, Rs and Ps were also evaluated via ANOVA and AMOVA. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful conditions during plant regeneration via in vitro tissue cultures affect regenerants and their sexual progeny leading to an increase in global DNA methylation of Rs and Ps compared to Ds in barley. The increased methylation level noted among regenerants remains unchanged in the Ps as indicated via RP-HPLC data. Marker-based experiments suggest that TEs are activated via in vitro tissue cultures and that, independently of the increased methylation, their activity in Rs is greater than in Ps. Thus, the increased methylation level may not correspond to the stabilization of TEs movement at least at the level of regenerants. The presence of TEs variation among Ds that were genetically and epigenetically uniform may suggest that at least some mobile elements may be active, and they may mask variation related to tissue cultures. Thus, tissue cultures may activate some TEs whereas the others remain intact, or their level of movement is changed. Finally, we suggest that sexual reproduction may be responsible for the stabilization of TEs.",3.369,423

DNA methylation plays an important role in the process of primary liver cancer occurrence and development. The P14ARF gene is an important tumor suppressor gene. It was found that P14ARF methylation is associated with the degree of malignancy in multiple tumors. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between P14ARF methylation level and primary liver cancer malignant degree. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues were collected from 87 primary liver cancer patients. Pyrosequencing was applied to obtain P14ARF methylation. Real-time PCR was used to detect P14ARF mRNA level. RESULTS: P14ARF methylation level in cancerous tissue was significantly higher than in the adjacent tissue (t=76.54, P<0.001). P14ARF methylation showed no significant difference in patients with different age, sex, smoking status, or drinking status. It did not present an obvious difference in tumors with different size. Its methylation level increased following the improvement of TNM stage (P<0.05). Compared with the adjacent tissue, P14ARF mRNA in carcinoma tissue decreased by 31% (t=28.91, P<0.001). P14ARF methylation showed a significant negative correlation with mRNA expression in cancerous tissue (r=-0.43, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: P14ARF mRNA level is regulated by DNA methylation in primary liver cancer.

Epigenetic epidemiology enables researchers to explore critical links between genomic coding, modifiable exposures, and manifestation of disease phenotype. One epigenetic link, DNA methylation, is potentially an important mechanism underlying these associations. In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of epidemiological studies investigating cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes in relation to DNA methylation, but many gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying cause and biological implications. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the biology and mechanisms of DNA methylation and its role in cardiovascular disease. In addition, we summarize the current evidence base in epigenetic epidemiology studies relevant to cardiovascular health and disease and discuss the limitations, challenges, and future directions of the field.

These epigenetic processes involve methylation of DNA and post-translational modifications of histones. It is well established that in particular histone methylation plays a key role in gene transcription. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between triple methylation of lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27Me3) modifications and atherosclerotic plaque stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 28 peri-renal aortic tissue patches covering the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic plaque development were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the levels of H3K27Me3, EZH2, JMJD3 and BMI1. KEY FINDINGS: The results of our studies are in support of a reduction in global levels of the H3K27Me3 modification in vessels with advanced atherosclerotic plaques. This reduction in H3K27Me3 levels is not accompanied by alterations in global levels of the corresponding histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Likewise no alterations in global levels of BMI1, a component of the PRC1 complex, which binds to H3K27Me3-modified histones or the global expression levels of the histone demethylase JMJD3, which removes the methyl marks on H3K27, were observed. SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our data show that in atherosclerosis development alterations in global levels of H3K27Me3 occur. The reduction in the number of nuclei in the tunica media that display the repressive H3K27Me3 mark in vessels with advanced atherosclerosis plaques therefore could be a reflection of the dynamic pattern of smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation associated with atherosclerotic disease.",2.702,1763

In these two environments, we studied associations between total serum IgE with methylation levels in CD14. METHODS: 500 Finnish and Russian Karelian children were included in four groups: Finnish children with high IgE (n=126) and low IgE (n=124) as well as Russian children with high IgE (n=125) and low IgE (n=125). DNA was extracted from whole blood cells and pyrosequenced. Three CpG sites were selected in the promoter region of CD14. RESULTS: Methylation levels in two of the three CpG sites were higher in the Finnish compared to Russian Karelian children. In the promoter area of CD14, the Finnish compared to Russian children with low IgE had a significant (p<0.0001) increase in methylation levels at the Amp5Site 2. Likewise, the Finnish compared to Russian children with high IgE had a significant (p=0.003) increase in methylation levels at the Amp5Site 3. In Russian children with low vs. high IgE there were significant differences in methylation levels, but this was not the case on the Finnish side. In the regression analysis, adding the methylation variation of CD14 to the model did not explain the higher asthma and allergy risk in the Finnish children.

Glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67) is a key synthetic enzyme for the main inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and diminishes in the spinal dorsal horn in rats following chronic constriction injury (CCI). GAD 67 is coded by gene GAD 1. DNA methylation can regulate the expression of GAD 67 by regulating the methylation of GAD 1 promoter in the psychotic brain. DNA methylation is primarily mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and methyl-DNA binding domain proteins (MBDs). In this study, in order to discover whether DNA methylation regulates GAD 67 expression in the spinal cord in CCI rats and is involved in neuropathic pain, we examined mRNA levels of DNMTs, MBDs and GAD 67 with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and methylation of GAD 1 promoter with Pyromark CpG Assays in the lumbar spinal cord in CCI rats on day 14 after surgery. Our results showed that DNMT3a, DNMT3b and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) expression increased, MBD2 expression decreased, and DNMT1, MBD1 and MBD3 expression hardly changed in the lumbar spinal cord in CCI rats on day 14 after surgery. GAD 67 expression decreased, and methylation of GAD 1 promoter increased in the lumbar spinal cord in CCI rats on day 14 after surgery. These results indicate that decreased GAD 67 may be associated with increased GAD 1 promoter methylation, which may be mediated by DNMT3a, DNMT3b, MeCP2 and MBD2 in CCI rats. These indicate that abnormal DNA methylation may be highly involved in CCI-induced neuropathic pain.",2.03,147

We also evaluated the contribution of the APOE 4 allele, the major late-onset AD genetic risk factor, to the studied gene methylation levels. All the genes showed low mean methylation levels (<5%) in both AD and control DNA, no difference between groups, and no correlation with the studied biomarkers, except for MTHFR that showed methylation levels ranging from 5% to 75%, and correlation with circulating biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism. However, mean MTHFR methylation levels were similar between groups (31.1% in AD and 30.7% in controls, P=0.58).

In HER2+ breast cancer, we found altered DNA methylation in genes involved in multicellular development, differentiation and transcription. Within these genes, we observed an overrepresentation of homeobox family genes, including several genes that have not been previously reported in relation to cancer (DBX1, NKX2-6, SIX6). Other affected genes included several belonging to the PI3K and Wnt signaling pathways. Notably, HER2, AKT3, HK1, and PFKP, genes for which altered methylation has not been previously reported, were also identified in this analysis. In total, we report 69 candidate biomarker genes with maximum differential methylation in HER2+ breast cancer. External validation of gene expression in a selected group of these genes (n = 13) revealed lowered mean gene expression in HER2+ breast cancer. We analyzed DNA methylation in six top candidate genes (AKR1B1, INA, FOXC2, NEUROD1, CDKL2, IRF4) using EpiTect Methyl II Custom PCR Array and confirmed the 450K array findings.

To identify a prognostic signature for breast cancer, we performed DNA methylation profiling and identified methylation markers that were associated with expression of ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, and EGFR proteins. Methylation markers that were correlated with corresponding mRNA expression levels were identified using 208 invasive tumors from a population-based case-control study conducted in Poland. Using this approach, we defined the methylation expression index (MEI) signature that was based on a weighted sum of mRNA levels of 57 genes. Classification of cases as low or high MEI scores was related to survival using Cox regression models. In the Polish study, women with ER-positive low MEI cancers had reduced survival at a median of 5.20 years of follow-up, HR = 2.85 95 % CI = 1.25-6.47. Low MEI was also related to decreased survival in four independent datasets totaling over 2500 ER-positive breast cancers.

The reelin (RELN) gene expression is significantly decreased in ASD, both in the brain and peripherally. Methylation at the RELN gene promoter is largely triggered at puberty, and hypermethylation has been found in post-mortem brains of schizophrenic and bipolar patients. METHODS: In this study, we assessed RELN gene methylation status in post-mortem temporocortical tissue samples (BA41/42 or 22) of six pairs of post-puberal individuals with ASD and typically developing subjects, matched for sex (male:female, M:F = 5:1), age, and post-mortem interval. RESULTS: ASD patients display a significantly higher number of methylated CpG islands and heavier methylation in the 5' region of the RELN gene promoter, spanning from -458 to -223 bp, whereas controls have more methylated CpG positions and greater extent of methylation at the 3' promoter region, spanning from -222 to +1 bp. The most upstream promoter region (-458 to -364 bp) is methylated only in ASD brains, while the most downstream region (-131 to +1 bp) is methylated exclusively in control brains. Within this general framework, three different methylation patterns are discernible, each correlated with different extents of reduction in reelin gene expression among ASD individuals compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The methylation pattern is different in ASD and control post-mortem brains. ASD-specific CpG positions, located in the most upstream gene promoter region, may exert a functional role potentially conferring ASD risk by blunting RELN gene expression.",3.268,1788

Set7/9 is a Lys methyltransferase that interacts with Pdx1. Here we tested the hypothesis that Lys methylation of Pdx1 by Set7/9 augments Pdx1 transcriptional activity. Using mass spectrometry and mutational analysis of purified proteins, we found that Set7/9 methylates the N-terminal residues Lys-123 and Lys-131 of Pdx1. Methylation of these residues occurred only in the context of intact, full-length Pdx1, suggesting a specific requirement of secondary and/or tertiary structural elements for catalysis by Set7/9. Immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometric analysis using beta cells verified Lys methylation of endogenous Pdx1. Cell-based luciferase reporter assays using wild-type and mutant transgenes revealed a requirement of Pdx1 residue Lys-131, but not Lys-123, for transcriptional augmentation by Set7/9. Lys-131 was not required for high-affinity interactions with DNA in vitro, suggesting that its methylation likely enhances post-DNA binding events. To define the role of Set7/9 in beta cell function, we generated mutant mice in which the gene encoding Set7/9 was conditionally deleted in beta cells (Set(Delta)beta). Set(Delta)beta mice exhibited glucose intolerance similar to Pdx1-deficient mice, and their isolated islets showed impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with reductions in expression of Pdx1 target genes. Our results suggest a previously unappreciated role for Set7/9-mediated methylation in the maintenance of Pdx1 activity and beta cell function.",0,63

We enrolled 76 consecutive ACHBLF patients, 80 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Methylation status of TGR5 promoter in peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) was detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The mRNA level of TGR5 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

The sample of the present study consisted of 43 clinically depressed women recruited from a psychosomatic inpatient unit and 42 healthy, female control subjects - mean age 30 years (SD = 9). DNA methylation profiles of the OXTR gene were assessed from leukocyte DNA by means of bisulfite sequencing. Depressed female patients had decreased OXTR exon 1 DNA methylation compared to non-depressed women. The association between depression and methylation level was moderated by OXTR rs53576 genotype. Exon 2 methylation was associated with OXTR rs53576 genotype but not with depression. Our findings suggest exon-specific methylation mechanisms. Exon 1 methylation appears to be associated with depressive phenotypes whereas exon 2 methylation is influenced by genotype. Previously reported divergent associations between OXTR genotype and depression might be explained by varying exon 1 methylation. In order to further understand the etiology of depression, research on the interplay between genotype, environmental influences and exon-specific methylation patterns is needed.",3.957,331

However, there is very limited information about the toxic effects of PFOS to marine organisms and its mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, adult sea urchins Glyptocidaris crenularis were exposed to PFOS for 21 d, followed by a 7-d depuration period, in order to investigate the toxicity of PFOS to sea urchin and its potential epigenetic mechanisms. Sea urchins dropped spines, and lowered down the motor ability and feeding ability after the PFOS exposure. Superoxide dismutase activities in supernatant of coelomic fluid of sea urchin increased firstly and then dropped down, while the change of the catalase activity took an opposite trend during the exposure period. They both approached to the corresponding activity of the control after the depuration period. The DNA methylation polymorphism, methylation rate and demethylation rate in sea urchin gonad all increased following the prolonged exposure time, and then decreased after the depuration period. The demethylation rates were lower than the corresponding methylation rates, therefore methylation events were dominant during the whole experimental period. This might suggest that sea urchin have strong self-protection mechanisms and can survive from the PFOS exposure presented in this study.

Identification of obesity-associated epigenetic changes in breast tissue may advance mechanistic understanding of breast cancer initiation and progression. The goal of this study, therefore, was to investigate associations between obesity and gene methylation in breast tumors. METHODS: Using the Illumina GoldenGate Cancer I Panel, we estimated the association between body mass index (BMI) and gene methylation in 345 breast tumor samples from phase I of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify sites that were differentially methylated by BMI. Stratification by tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status was also conducted. RESULTS: In the majority of the 935 probes analyzed (87%), the average beta value increased with obesity (BMI >/= 30). Obesity was significantly associated with differential methylation (FDR q < 0.05) in just two gene loci in breast tumor tissue overall and in 21 loci among ER-positive tumors. Obesity was associated with methylation of genes that function in immune response, cell growth, and DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with altered methylation overall, and with hypermethylation among ER-positive tumors in particular, suggesting that obesity may influence the methylation of genes with known relevance to cancer. Some of these differences in methylation by obese status may influence levels of gene expression within breast cells. IMPACT: If our results are validated, obesity-associated methylation sites could serve as targets for prevention and treatment research. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 24(3); 580-6.

The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a widely used platform in large-scale epidemiologic studies. This platform can efficiently and simultaneously measure methylation levels at  approximately 480,000 CpG sites in the human genome in multiple study samples. Due to the intrinsic chip design of 2 types of chemistry probes, data normalization or preprocessing is a critical step to consider before data analysis. To date, numerous methods and pipelines have been developed for this purpose, and some studies have been conducted to evaluate different methods. However, validation studies have often been limited to a small number of CpG sites to reduce the variability in technical replicates. In this study, we measured methylation on a set of samples using both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and 450K chips. We used WGBS data as a gold standard of true methylation states in cells to compare the performances of 8 normalization methods for 450K data on a genome-wide scale. Analyses on our dataset indicate that the most effective methods are peak-based correction (PBC) and quantile normalization plus beta-mixture quantile normalization (QN.BMIQ). To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically compare existing normalization methods for Illumina 450K data using novel WGBS data. Our results provide a benchmark reference for the analysis of DNA methylation chip data, particularly in white blood cells.",4.78,1224

Latent membrane protein (LMP) 1, 2A and 2B of EBV exert multiple oncogenic properties by activating multiple signal pathways and modulating the expression of various oncogenes. AIMS: To study the methylation and expression of LMP1, 2A and LMP2B in EBV-positive cell lines and EBV-associated tumors. METHODS: The methylation profiles of LMP1p, LMP2Ap and LMP2Bp were evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP), as well as their expression by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR in 41 EBV-associated carcinomas (EBVaGCs) and 5 EBV-positive cell lines. RESULTS: All LMP promoters were methylated at different degrees in EBV-positive cell lines and hypermethylated in EBV-associated gastric carcinomas, while unmethylated LMP2Ap alleles were detected in B95-8 cell line. Following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) treatment, the LMP1 expression was restored along with concomitant promoter demethylation; changes of LMP2A and LMP2B expression were different in different cells. CONCLUSION: Methylation of LMP1, 2A and 2B promoters mediates the silencing of LMP1, 2A and 2B in EBV-associated carcinomas and cell lines in varying degrees, and could be reactivated by demethylation agent and thus may contribute to the therapy of EBVaGCs.",2.963,1640

By means of a comprehensive genomic analysis on 6637 tissues of 21 tumor types, we here show that the degrees of overall methylation in CpG island (CGI) and demethylation in intergenic regions, defined as 'backbone', largely vary among different tumors. Depending on tumor type, both CGI methylation and backbone demethylation are often associated with clinical, epidemiological and biological features such as age, sex, smoking history, anatomic location, histological type and grade, stage, molecular subtype and biological pathways. We found connections between CGI methylation and hypermutability, microsatellite instability, IDH1 mutation, 19p gain and polycomb features, and backbone demethylation with chromosomal instability, NSD1 and TP53 mutations, 5q and 19p loss and long repressive domains. These broad epigenetic patterns add a new dimension to our understanding of tumor biology and its clinical implications.",9.112,1626

 Pan American Society for Clinical Virology",2015,"BACKGROUND: Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 causes the majority of cervical cancers. Genital HPV infection is very common, but neoplastic progression is uncommon. There is an urgent need for biomarkers associated with cervical neoplasia, to enable triage of women who test positive for HPV. OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of quantitative measurement of HPV16 DNA methylation to separate samples of different cytological and histological grades from young women, among whom rates of HPV infection are high. STUDY DESIGN: DNA methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing of bisulphite converted DNA from liquid based cytology samples from 234 women (mean age 20.6 years) who tested positive for HPV16 and showed varying degrees of neoplasia. Methylation was assessed at CpGs in the HPV E2 and L1/L2 regions. RESULTS: The performance of methylation-based classifiers was assessed by ROC curve analyses. The best combination of CpGs (5600 and 5609) achieved AUCs of 0.656 (95% CI=0.520-0.792) for separation of cytologically normal and severely dyskaryotic samples, and 0.639 (95% CI=0.547-0.731) for separation of samples with or without high-grade neoplasia (CIN2+/-). CONCLUSIONS: The data are consistent with HPV L1/L2 methylation being a marker of the duration of infection in a specific host. Assessment of HPV DNA methylation is hence a promising biomarker to triage HPV-positive cytology samples, but may have limited utility in young women. Future studies assessing the likely utility of HPV DNA methylation as a potential triage biomarker must take account of women's age.",1.212,395

DESIGN: Case-control study matched for age and body mass index. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENT(S): Ten women with PCOS who underwent ovarian drilling to induce ovulation and 10 healthy women who were undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, hysterectomy for benign conditions, diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain, or oophorectomy for nonovarian indications. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns determined by immunoprecipitation and microarray (MeDIP-chip) analysis. RESULT(S): The methylation levels were statistically significantly higher in CpG island shores (CGI shores), which lie outside of core promoter regions, and lower within gene bodies in women with PCOS relative to the controls. In addition, high CpG content promoters were the most frequently hypermethylated promoters in PCOS ovaries but were more often hypomethylated in controls. Second, 872 CGIs, specifically methylated in PCOS, represented 342 genes that could be associated with various molecular functions, including protein binding, hormone activity, and transcription regulator activity. Finally, methylation differences were validated in seven genes by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. These genes correlated to several functional families related to the pathogenesis of PCOS and may be potential biomarkers for this disease. CONCLUSION(S): Our results demonstrated that epigenetic modification differs between PCOS and normal ovaries, which may help to further understand the pathophysiology of this disease.",4.59,413

FLS may develop into fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS), characterized by sudden death from hepatic rupture and hemorrhage. DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing, leading to the etiology and pathogenesis of some animal diseases. The roles of DNA methylation in the genesis of FLS, however, are largely unknown. The lipogenic methyl-deficient diet (MDD) caused FLS similar to human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). After 16 Jingxing-Huang (JXH) hens were fed MDD for 10 wk, eight exhibited FLS (designated as FLS-susceptible birds); the remainder, without FLS, served as controls (NFLS). Physiological and biochemical variables, gene expression levels, and DNA methylation were determined in the liver. The development of FLS in JXH hens was accompanied by abnormal lipid accumulation. Relative expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) were significantly up-regulated in the FLS group in comparison with the NFLS group. The transcript abundance of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) did not differ between the two groups. Interestingly, MTTP and ACC mRNA abundance were negatively correlated with the level of promoter methylation. The extent of DNA methylation of the cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in the SREBP-1c, FAS, PPARalpha, and LXRalpha promoter regions was also analyzed by direct sequencing but none differed between FLS and NFLS birds.

It has been reported that GNA12 is overexpressed during preeclampsia. In this study, we investigated the potential association between the methylation of the GNA12 promoter and preeclampsia. The methylation level at eight CpG sites of the GNA12 promoter was analyzed by MassARRAY in placenta and peripheral blood DNA samples from 50 preeclampsia patients and 50 normal pregnant women. In the placenta DNA samples, the methylation level at three CpG sites of the GNA12 promoter was significantly lower in the preeclampsia patients than in the controls. The difference was also significant at two of the three CpG sites in the peripheral blood DNA samples. The mRNA expression level of GNA12 in placenta was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in 20 cases and 20 controls. Consistent with the decreased methylation level, the mRNA expression level of GNA12 was higher in preeclampsia patients than in controls. Our results showed that preeclampsia is associated with decreased methylation of the GNA12 promoter, which can be detected in both the placenta and the peripheral blood of the pregnant women.",2.211,148

We have proposed that during thiocoraline biosynthesis, TioN, a stand-alone adenylation domain interrupted by the S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding region of a methyltransferase enzyme, is capable of performing two functions: the adenylation and S-methylation of l-cysteine. Herein, by preparation of knockouts of TioN and its MbtH-like protein partner TioT, we confirmed their role in thiocoraline biosynthesis. We also co-expressed recombinant TioN and TioT and biochemically investigated three potential pathways involving activation, methylation, and loading of l-cysteine onto the TioN partner thiolation domain, TioS(T4). The valuable insights gained into the pathway(s) followed for the production of S-Me-l-Cys-S-TioS(T4) will serve as a guide for the development of novel engineered interrupted adenylation enzymes for combinatorial biosynthesis.",12.113,1558

To analyze such multi-omics data and explore relationships, reliable bioinformatics systems are much needed. Existing systems are either for exploring curated data or for processing omics data in the form of a library such as R. Thus scientists have much difficulty in investigating relationships among gene expression, DNA sequence variation, and DNA methylation using multi-omics data. In this study, we report a system called BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS for the integrated analysis of DNA methylation, sequence variation (SNPs), and gene expression for distinguishing cellular phenotypes at the pairwise and multiple phenotype levels. The system can be deployed on either the Amazon cloud or a publicly available high-performance computing node, and the data analysis and exploration of the analysis result can be conveniently done using a web-based interface. In order to alleviate analysis complexity, all the process are fully automated, and graphical workflow system is integrated to represent real-time analysis progression. The BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS system works in three stages. First, it processes and analyzes multi-omics data as input in the form of the raw data, i.e., FastQ files. Second, various integrated analyses such as methylation vs. gene expression and mutation vs. methylation are performed. Finally, the analysis result can be explored in a number of ways through a web interface for the multi-level, multi-perspective exploration. Multi-level interpretation can be done by either gene, gene set, pathway or network level and multi-perspective exploration can be explored from either gene expression, DNA methylation, sequence variation, or their relationship perspective. The utility of the system is demonstrated by performing analysis of phenotypically distinct 30 breast cancer cell line data set.

However, common methylation patterns, cell lineage- and cell line-specific DNA methylation patterns across multiple cell lines have not yet been explored completely. Using the DNA methylation data across 54 human cell lines, we identified 35 276 local DNA methylation regions called local clusters of CpG sites (LCCSs). We constructed an LCCS co-methylation network and investigated the common DNA methylation patterns across all cell lines, which reveal two distinct groups in terms of their methylation level and genomic characteristics. We further detected diverse sets of cell lineage-specific high- and low-methylation patterns, which were depleted in promoter, CpG island (CGI) and repeat regions but enriched in gene body and non-CGI regions, especially the CGI shore regions. We discovered that the cell lineage-specific low-methylated LCCSs were enriched with functional transcriptional factor binding motif regions. Moreover, the detected cell line-specific high- and low-methylated patterns show distinct enrichments in cell line-specific chromatin states and functional relevance with the corresponding cell lines.",6.393,353

Whether hypomethylation of the Dloop region is involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide subunit 2 (ND2) expressions in colorectal cancer has remained elusive. In the present study, the association between methylation status of the Dloop region, mtDNA copy number and ND2 expression was investigated in 65 colorectal cancer specimens and their corresponding noncancerous tissues. In addition, a demethylation experiment was performed on the Caco2 colorectal cancer cell line by using 5aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza). The methylation rate of the Dloop region in all 65 colorectal cancer tissues was markedly reduced when compared with that of their corresponding noncancerous tissues (13.8 vs. 81.5%; P<0.05). Furthermore, the methylation rate of the Dloop region in colorectal cancer tissues was markedly decreased in clinicopathological stages III and IV compared with that in clinicopathological stages I and II (7.1 and 0% vs. 25 and 16%; P<0.05). In addition, the mean relative mtDNA copy number and ND2 expression in colorectal cancer tissues were increased compared with those in the corresponding noncancerous tissues. Demethylation of the Dloop region was associated with an elevated mtDNA copy number and an increased ND2 expression. Furthermore, the mtDNA copy number and ND2 expression in Caco2 cells were significantly increased after 5Aza treatment. In conclusion, demethylation of the Dloop region is likely to be involved in the regulation of the mtDNA copy number and ND-2 expression.",1.554,1293

We used the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay to measure memory. We provide the first demonstration that DNA methylation is also important in the olfactory extinction learning of A. cerana. DNMT did not reduce acquisition learning in either species. However, zeb bidirectionally and differentially altered extinction learning in both species. In particular, zeb provided 1h before acquisition learning improved extinction memory retention in A. mellifera, but reduced extinction memory retention in A. cerana. The reasons for these differences are unclear, but provide a basis for future studies to explore species-specific differences in the effects of methylation on memory formation.",2.47,1499

Differential methylation in CN-AML was most prominent in genomic areas far from CGIs, in so called open sea regions. Furthermore, differential methylation was specifically found in genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), with WT1 being the most differentially methylated TF. Among genetic mutations in AML, DNMT3A mutations showed the most prominent association with the DNA methylation pattern, characterized by hypomethylation of CGIs (as compared with DNMT3A wild type cases). The differential methylation in DNMT3A mutant cells vs. wild type cells was predominantly found in HOX genes, which were hypomethylated. These results were confirmed and validated in an independent CN-AML cohort.

The role of CGGBP1 as a possible mediator of CpG methylation however remains unknown. At CpG-rich sequences cytosine methylation is a major mechanism of transcriptional repression. Concordantly, gene-rich regions typically carry lower levels of CpG methylation than the repetitive elements. It is well known that at interspersed repeats Alu-SINEs and L1-LINEs high levels of CpG methylation constitute a transcriptional silencing and retrotransposon inactivating mechanism. RESULTS: Here, we have studied genome-wide CpG methylation with or without CGGBP1-depletion. By high throughput sequencing of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA we have identified CGGBP1 to be a negative regulator of CpG methylation at repetitive DNA sequences. In addition, we have studied CpG methylation alterations on Alu and L1 retrotransposons in CGGBP1-depleted cells using a novel bisulfite-treatment and high throughput sequencing approach.

Several enzymes that modulate these post-translational modifications of histones are promising targets for development of small molecule drugs. However, there is no promising real-time histone methylation detection tool currently available to screen and validate potential small molecule histone methylation modulators in small animal models. With this in mind, we developed genetically encoded molecular biosensors based on the split-enzyme complementation approach for in vitro and in vivo imaging of lysine 9 (H3-K9 sensor) and lysine 27 (H3-K27 sensor) methylation marks of histone 3. These methylation sensors were validated in vitro in HEK293T, HepG2, and HeLa cells. The efficiency of the histone methylation sensor was assessed by employing methyltransferase inhibitors (Bix01294 and UNC0638), demethylase inhibitor (JIB-04), and siRNA silencing at the endogenous histone K9-methyltransferase enzyme level. Furthermore, noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of histone methylation sensors confirmed the potential of these sensors in monitoring histone methylation status in response to histone methyltransferase inhibitors in living animals. Experimental results confirmed that the developed H3-K9 and H3-K27 sensors are specific and sensitive to image the drug-induced histone methylation changes in living animals. These novel histone methylation sensors can facilitate the in vitro screening and in vivo characterization of new histone methyltransferase inhibitors and accelerate the pace of introduction of epigenetic therapies into the clinic.",5.636,137

Here we extend our initial observation to the entire mouse genome by enriching for methylated DNA with the MethylMiner kit and performing next-generation sequencing (MBD-Seq) in wild-type and Gsk-3alpha(-/-);Gsk-3beta(-/-) ESCs. Consistent with our previous data, we found that 77% of known imprinted loci have reduced DNA methylation in Gsk-3-deficient ESCs. More specifically, we unambiguously identified changes in DNA methylation within regions that have been confirmed to function as imprinting control regions. In many cases, the reduced DNA methylation at imprinted loci in Gsk-3alpha(-/-);Gsk-3beta(-/-) ESCs was accompanied by changes in gene expression as well. Furthermore, many of the Gsk-3-dependent, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are identical to the DMRs recently identified in uniparental ESCs.

Thus, the interplay between transcription factor (TF) binding and DNA methylation are two components of a cancer regulatory interactome presumed to display correlated signals. As proof of concept, we performed a systematic motif-based in silico analysis to infer all potential TFs that are involved in breast cancer prognosis through an association with DNA methylation changes. Using breast cancer DNA methylation and clinical data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we carried out a systematic inference of TFs whose misregulation underlie different clinical subtypes of breast cancer. Our analysis identified TFs known to be associated with clinical outcomes of p53 and ER (estrogen receptor) subtypes of breast cancer, while also predicting new TFs that may also be involved. Furthermore, our results suggest that misregulation in breast cancer can be caused by the binding of alternative factors to the binding sites of TFs whose activity has been ablated. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis that links DNA methylation to TF binding to patient prognosis.",4.62,1510

We observed a significant overlap (P=0.002) of 33 genes with changes in DNA methylation in T lymphocytes of neonates and brains of adult offspring. Many of these genes are involved in immune system functions. Our results show that DNA methylation changes in offspring associated with maternal depression are detectable at birth in the immune system and persist to adulthood in the brain. This is consistent with the hypothesis that system-wide epigenetic changes are involved in life-long responses to maternal depression in the offspring.",5.62,733
27241573,Computational prediction of methylation types of covalently modified lysine and arginine residues in proteins.,[],Briefings in bioinformatics,2016,"Protein methylation is an essential posttranslational modification (PTM) mostly occurs at lysine and arginine residues, and regulates a variety of cellular processes. Owing to the rapid progresses in the large-scale identification of methylation sites, the available data set was dramatically expanded, and more attention has been paid on the identification of specific methylation types of modification residues. Here, we briefly summarized the current progresses in computational prediction of methylation sites, which provided an accurate, rapid and efficient approach in contrast with labor-intensive experiments. We collected 5421 methyllysines and methylarginines in 2592 proteins from the literature, and classified most of the sites into different types. Data analyses demonstrated that different types of methylated proteins were preferentially involved in different biological processes and pathways, whereas a unique sequence preference was observed for each type of methylation sites. Thus, we developed a predictor of GPS-MSP, which can predict mono-, di- and tri-methylation types for specific lysines, and mono-, symmetric di- and asymmetrical di-methylation types for specific arginines. We critically evaluated the performance of GPS-MSP, and compared it with other existing tools. The satisfying results exhibited that the classification of methylation sites into different types for training can considerably improve the prediction accuracy. Taken together, we anticipate that our study provides a new lead for future computational analysis of protein methylation, and the prediction of methylation types of covalently modified lysine and arginine residues can generate more useful information for further experimental manipulation.",9.617,715

In this study, we analysed major safety aspects of human oocyte vitrification in a high security closed system: (i) chromosomal meiotic segregation, (ii) embryonic developmental kinetics and (iii) DNA (hydroxy)methylation status. Fresh and vitrified sibling oocytes from young donors after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were compared in three different assays. Firstly, the chromosomal constitution of the fertilized zygotes was deduced from array comparative genomic hybridization results obtained from both polar bodies biopsied at Day 1. Secondly, embryo development up to Day 3 was analysed by time-lapse imaging. Ten specific time points, six morphokinetic time intervals and the average cell number on Day 3 were recorded. Thirdly, global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns were analysed by immunostaining on Day 3 embryos. The nuclear fluorescence intensity was measured by Volocity imaging software. Comprehensive chromosomal screening of the polar bodies demonstrated that at least half of the zygotes obtained after ICSI of fresh and vitrified oocytes were euploid. Time-lapse analysis showed that there was no significant difference in cleavage timings, the predictive morphokinetic time intervals nor the average cell number between embryos developed from fresh and vitrified oocytes. Finally, global DNA (hydroxy)methylation patterns were not significantly different between Day 3 embryos obtained from fresh and from vitrified oocytes. Our data further consolidate the safety of the oocyte vitrification technique. Nevertheless, additional testing in young and older sub-fertile/infertile patients and sound follow-up studies of children born after oocyte cryopreservation remain mandatory.",3.747,1564

Age-related changes in DNA methylation at the genome scale have been termed 'epigenetic drift', but the defining features of this phenomenon remain to be established. Human epidermis represents an excellent model for understanding age-related epigenetic changes because of its substantial cell-type homogeneity and its well-known age-related phenotype. We have now generated and analyzed the currently largest set of human epidermis methylomes (N = 108) using array-based profiling of 450 000 methylation marks in various age groups. Data analysis confirmed that age-related methylation differences are locally restricted and characterized by relatively small effect sizes. Nevertheless, methylation data could be used to predict the chronological age of sample donors with high accuracy. We also identified discontinuous methylation changes as a novel feature of the aging methylome. Finally, our analysis uncovered an age-related erosion of DNA methylation patterns that is characterized by a reduced dynamic range and increased heterogeneity of global methylation patterns. These changes in methylation variability were accompanied by a reduced connectivity of transcriptional networks. Our findings thus define the loss of epigenetic regulatory fidelity as a key feature of the aging epigenome.",6.34,607

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are putatively involved in the regulation of the circadian clock system. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a weight loss intervention based on an energy-controlled Mediterranean dietary pattern in the methylation levels of 3 clock genes, BMAL1, CLOCK, and NR1D1, and the association between the methylation levels and changes induced in the serum lipid profile with the weight loss treatment. The study sample enrolled 61 women (body mass index = 28.6 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2); age: 42.2 +/- 11.4 years), who followed a nutritional program based on a Mediterranean dietary pattern. DNA was isolated from whole blood obtained at the beginning and end point. Methylation levels at different CpG sites of BMAL1, CLOCK, and NR1D1 were analyzed by Sequenom's MassArray. The energy-restricted intervention modified the methylation levels of different CpG sites in BMAL1 (CpGs 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 18) and NR1D1 (CpGs 1, 10, 17, 18, 19, and 22). Changes in cytosine methylation in the CpG 5 to 9 region of BMAL1 with the intervention positively correlated with the eveningness profile (p = 0.019). The baseline methylation of the CpG 5 to 9 region in BMAL1 positively correlated with energy (p = 0.047) and carbohydrate (p = 0.017) intake and negatively correlated with the effect of the weight loss intervention on total cholesterol (p = 0.032) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.005). Similar significant and positive correlations were found between changes in methylation levels in the CpG 5 to 9 region of BMAL1 due to the intervention and changes in serum lipids (p < 0.05). This research describes apparently for the first time an association between changes in the methylation of the BMAL1 gene with the intervention and the effects of a weight loss intervention on blood lipids levels.",2.774,1007

In the present study, we explored PCDH10 expression and promoter methylation status, and its biological effects in pancreatic cancer cells, and furthermore, we explored the mechanism of PCDH10 preliminary in pancreatic cancer cells. the mRNA level of PCDH10 was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR and promoter methylation status examined by methylation-specific PCR in the pancreatic cancer cells (Capan-1, Panc-1, AsPC-1 and BxPC-3) as well as the human normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells HPDE6-C7 which was used as a control. The human pancreatic cells were transfected with plasmid pcDNA3.1-PCDH10 or pcDNA3.1 by lipofectamine 2000. The biological function of PCDH10 in pancreatic cancer cells was determined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, Transwell invasion assay and wound-healing assay. The levels of apoptosis related proteins were examined by western blotting. PCDH10 expression was obviously downregulated in the pancreatic cancer cells (Capan-1, Panc-1, BxPC-3) compared to the normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. PCDH10 promoter methylation was observed in the two pancreatic cancer cells Capan-1 and BxPC-3,and the expression of PCDH10 could be restored after treating with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A in the two cell types. Overexpression of PCDH10 can inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion ability of pancreatic cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Ectopic expression of PCDH10 could increase the levels of PARP, caspase-3, caspase-9 and decrease the level of bcl-2, AKT and p-AKT.

However, the molecular details and clinical impact of HBV integration on either human or HBV epigenomes are unknown. Here, we show that methylation of the integrated HBV DNA is related to the methylation status of the flanking human genome. We developed a next-generation sequencing-based method for structural methylation analysis of integrated viral genomes (denoted G-NaVI). This method is a novel approach that enables enrichment of viral fragments for sequencing using unique baits based on the sequence of the HBV genome. We detected integrated HBV sequences in the genome of the PLC/PRF/5 cell line and found variable levels of methylation within the integrated HBV genomes. Allele-specific methylation analysis revealed that the HBV genome often became significantly methylated when integrated into highly methylated host sites. After integration into unmethylated human genome regions such as promoters, however, the HBV DNA remains unmethylated and may eventually play an important role in tumorigenesis. The observed dynamic changes in DNA methylation of the host and viral genomes may functionally affect the biological behavior of HBV. These findings may impact public health given that millions of people worldwide are carriers of HBV. We also believe our assay will be a powerful tool to increase our understanding of the various types of DNA virus-associated tumorigenesis.",14.63,916

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) promoter methylation is strongly associated with HPV-associated cancer. CCNA1 methylation is found in HPV-associated cervical cancers, as well as in head and neck squamous cell cancer. Numerous pieces of evidence suggest that E7 may drive CCNA1 methylation. First, the CCNA1 promoter is methylated in HPV-positive epithelial lesions after transformation. Second, the CCNA1 promoter is methylated at a high level when HPV is integrated into the human genome. Finally, E7 has been shown to interact with DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). Here, we sought to determine the mechanism by which E7 increases methylation in cervical cancer by using CCNA1 as a gene model. We investigated whether E7 induces CCNA1 promoter methylation, resulting in the loss of expression. Using both E7 knockdown and overexpression approaches in SiHa and C33a cells, our data showed that CCNA1 promoter methylation decreases with a corresponding increase in expression in E7 siRNA-transfected cells. By contrast, CCNA1 promoter methylation was augmented with a corresponding reduction in expression in E7-overexpressing cells. To confirm whether the binding of the E7-Dnmt1 complex to the CCNA1 promoter induced methylation and loss of expression, ChIP assays were carried out in E7-, del CR3-E7 and vector control-overexpressing C33a cells. The data showed that E7 induced CCNA1 methylation by forming a complex with Dnmt1 at the CCNA1 promoter, resulting in the subsequent reduction of expression in cancers. It is interesting to further explore the genome-wide mechanism of E7 oncoprotein-mediated DNA methylation.",3.523,156

Cord blood aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) DNA methylation is responsive to maternal smoking during pregnancy. AHRR serves not only to inhibit aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) transcription, which is involved in mediating xenobiotic metabolism, but it is also involved in cell growth and differentiation. Other than maternal smoking, other predictors of offspring AHRR DNA methylation status remain unknown; we sought to identify them among newborns. We enrolled pregnant women in the PROGRESS birth cohort in Mexico City. Using pyrosequencing, we analyzed DNA methylation of 3 CpG sites within the AHRR gene promoter from the umbilical cord blood of 531 infants. We used generalized estimating equations to account for the correlation of DNA methylation between CpG sites. Multivariable models were used to adjust for maternal age, BMI, education, parity, smoke-exposure, infant sex, gestational age, and birth weight-for-gestational age. AHRR DNA methylation was positively associated with maternal BMI (P = 0.0009) and negatively associated with the length of gestation (P < 0.0001) and birth weight-for-gestational age (P < 0.0001). AHRR DNA methylation was 2.1% higher in offspring of obese vs. normal weight mothers and 3.1% higher in preterm vs. term infants, representing a third and a half standard deviation differences in methylation, respectively. In conclusion, offspring AHRR DNA methylation was associated with maternal obesity during pregnancy as well as infant gestational age and birth weight-for-gestational age.

Several environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors have been suggested to have a role in GC development. Epigenetic mechanisms like histone changes and promoter hyper-methylation are now being increasingly studied. Associations between methylation of many gene promoters with the risk of gastric cancer have been investigated worldwide. Such aberrant methylation may result in silencing of specific genes related to cell cycling, cell adhesion, apoptosis and DNA repair. Thus this molecular mechanism might have a key role in proliferation and migration of cancerous cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review article we included studies conducted on DNA methylation and gastric cancer in Iranian populations. Using Science direct, Pubmed/PMC, Springer, Wiley online library and SciELO databases, all published data until 31 January 2016 were gathered. We also searched Science direct data base for similar investigations around the world to make a comparison between Iran and other countries. RESULTS: By searching these databases, we found that the association between methylation of seven gene promoters and gastric cancer had been studied in Iran until 31 January 2016. These genes were p16, hLMH1, E-cadherin, CTLA4, THRbeta, mir9 and APC. Searching in science direct database also showed that 92 articles had been published around the world till January 2016. Our investigation revealed that despite the importance of GC and its high prevalence in Iran, the methylation status of only a few gene promoters has been studied so far. More studies with higher sample numbers are needed to reveal the relation of methylation status of gene promoters to gastric cancer in Iran.

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Academic andrology and in vitro fertilization laboratory. PATIENT(S): Twenty-seven semen samples from couples who conceived within 2 months of attempting a pregnancy and 29 semen samples from couples unable to achieve a pregnancy within 12 months. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Genomewide assessment of differential sperm DNA methylation and standard semen analysis. RESULT(S): We analyzed DNA methylation alterations associated with fecundity in 124 semen samples, and identified regions of interest in 27 semen samples from couples who conceived within 2 months of attempting a pregnancy and a total of 29 semen samples from couples who were unable to achieve a pregnancy within 12 months. No differences in sperm count, sperm morphology, or semen volume were observed between the patients achieving a pregnancy within 2 months of study time and those not obtaining a pregnancy within 12 months. However, using data from the human methylation 450k array analysis we did identify two genomic regions with statistically significantly decreased (false discovery rate <0.01) methylation and three genomic regions with statistically significantly increased methylation in the failure-to-conceive group. The only two sites where decreased methylation was associated with reduced fecundity are at closely related genes known to be expressed in sperm, HSPA1L and HSPA1B. CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggest that there are genomic loci where DNA methylation alterations are associated with decreased fecundity. We have thus identified candidate loci for future study to verify these results and investigate the causative or contributory relationship between altered sperm methylation and decreased fecundity.",4.59,84

However, mean regression analyses may not capture associations that occur primarily in the tails of the outcome distribution. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined whether the association between particulate air pollution and DNA methylation differs across quantiles of the methylation distribution. We focused on methylation of candidate genes related to coagulation and inflammation: coagulation factor III (F3), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and toll-like receptor 2 (TRL-2). METHODS: We measured gene-specific blood DNA methylation repeatedly in 777 elderly men participating in the Normative Aging Study (1999-2010). We fit quantile regressions for longitudinal data to investigate whether the associations of particle number, PM2.5 (diameter </= 2.5 mum)black carbon, and PM2.5 mass concentrations (4-week moving average) with DNA methylation [expressed as the percentage of methylated cytosines over the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosines at position 5 (%5mC)] varied across deciles of the methylation distribution. We reported the quantile regression coefficients that corresponded to absolute differences in DNA methylation (expressed in %5mC) associated with an interquartile range increase in air pollution concentration. RESULTS: Interquartile range increases in particle number, PM2.5 black carbon, and PM2.5 mass concentrations were associated with significantly lower methylation in the lower tails of the IFN-gamma and ICAM-1 methylation distributions. For instance, a 3.4-mug/m3 increase in PM2.5 mass concentration was associated with a 0.18%5mC (95% CI: -0.30, -0.06) decrease on the 20th percentile of ICAM-1 methylation, but was not significantly related to the 80th percentile (estimate: 0.07%5mC, 95% CI: -0.09, 0.24).

Both mCyt and hmCyt were measured by a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method in neoplastic and homologous nonneoplastic tissues, i.e., liver and gallbladder, and in PBMCs of 31 HCC and 16 CC patients. Content of mCyt was notably lower in HCC than in CC tissues (3.97% versus 5.26%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Significantly reduced mCyt was also detected in HCC compared to nonneoplastic tissue (3.97% versus 4.82% mCyt, respectively; P < 0.0001), but no such difference was found for CC versus homologous nonneoplastic tissue.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of sulforaphane (SFN), a phytochemical from cruciferous vegetables, on the methylation and expression of PTEN and RARbeta2 tumour suppressor genes as well as on the expression of regulators of DNA methylation reaction, DNMT1 , p53 , and p21 , in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells with different invasive potential. We also evaluate the role of SFN epigenetic effects in support of therapy with clofarabine (ClF) that was recently shown to modulate the epigenome as well. METHODS: Promoter methylation and gene expression were estimated using methylation-sensitive restriction analysis and real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, SFN at IC 50 (22 and 46 mu M , respectively) and a physiologically relevant 10 mu M concentration lead to hypomethylation of PTEN and RARbeta2 promoters with concomitant gene upregulation. The combination of SFN and ClF enhances these effects, resulting in an increase in cell growth arrest and apoptosis at a non-invasive breast cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that SFN activates DNA methylation-silenced tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer cells and may contribute to SFN-mediated support of therapy with an anti-cancer drug, ClF, increasing its applications in solid tumours.",2.0,1651

First, clustering analysis revealed that the biological variation is higher than the variation introduced by the two sample processing techniques and clusters formed in accordance with the biological tissue origin and not with the sample preservation method. Second, we combined open modification search and spectral counting to find modifications that are more abundant in FFPE samples compared to frozen samples. This analysis revealed lysine methylation (+14 Da) as the most frequent modification induced by FFPE preservation. We also detected a slight increase in methylene (+12 Da) and methylol (+30 Da) adducts as well as a putative modification of +58 Da, but they contribute less to the overall modification count. Subsequent SEQUEST analysis and X!Tandem searches of different datasets confirmed these trends.

Genome-wide methylation studies in monozygotic (MZ) twins are providing insight into the extent of epigenetic variation that occurs, irrespective of genotype. However, little is known about the variability of DNA methylation patterns in adolescence, a period involving significant and rapid physical, emotional, social, and neurodevelopmental change. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation using the 450 K Illumina BeadChip in a sample of 37 MZ twin pairs followed longitudinally since birth to investigate: 1) the extent of variation in DNA methylation in identical genetic backgrounds in adolescence and; 2) whether these variations are randomly distributed or enriched in particular functional pathways. We also assessed stability of DNA methylation over 3-6 months to distinguish stable trait-like and variable state-like genes. A pathway analysis found high within-pair variability in genes associated with development, cellular mechanisms, tissue and cell morphology, and various disorders. Test-retest analyses performed in a sub-sample of 8 twin pairs demonstrated enrichment in gene pathways involved in organismal development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and particular disorders. The variability found in functional gene pathways may plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample. Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in certain gene pathways.",4.78,1327

METHODS: Gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Promoter methylation status was determined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) in HNSCC. RESULTS: Methylation was associated with transcription inhibition. SST methylation in 81% of HNSCC tumor specimens significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.043), stage (P = 0.008), galanin receptor type 2 (GALR2) methylation (P = 0.041), and tachykinin-1 (TAC1) (P = 0.040). SSTR1 hypermethylation in 64% of cases was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.037), stage (P = 0.037), SST methylation (P < 0.001), and expression of galanin (P = 0.03), GALR2 (P = 0.014), TAC1 (P = 0.023), and tachykinin receptor type 1 (TACR1) (P = 0.003). SST and SSTR1 promoter hypermethylation showed highly discriminating receiver operator characteristic curve profiles, which clearly distinguished HNSCC from adjacent normal mucosal tissues. Concurrent hypermethylation of galanin and SSTR1 promoters correlated with reduced disease-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.0001). Among patients with oral cavity and oropharynx cancer, methylation of both SST and SSTR1 promoters correlated with reduced disease-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.028). In multivariate logistic-regression analysis, concomitant methylation of galanin and SSTR1 was associated with an odds ratio for recurrence of 12.53 (95% CI, 2.62 to 59.8; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: CpG hypermethylation is a likely mechanism of SST and SSTR1 gene inactivation, supporting the hypothesis that SST and SSTR1 play a role in the tumorigenesis of HNSCC and that this hypermethylation may serve as an important biomarker.",3.234,1212

DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs), and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), mediated by the methyltransferase, Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), are some of the most commonly found modifications in epigenetics. Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is associated with pulmonary epithelial and vascular development and regulates expression at the post-transcriptional level by DNA methylation through DNMT1 or DNMT3b. However, the involvements of these epigenetic factors in the occurrence of BPD are, as yet, unclear. METHODS: Newborn rats were randomly assigned to a model, hyperoxia (85 % O2) or control, normoxia group (21 % O2). Lung tissues and alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells were collected between 1-14 days. The expression of DNMTs, and EZH2 was detected by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real-time PCR. The percentage of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 levels in the RUNX3 promoter region was measured by bisulfite sequencing PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. RUNX3 protein and mRNA expression in AT2 cells was also measured after inhibition using the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, the H3K27me3 inhibitor, JMJD3, and the EZH2 inhibitor, DZNep. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, RUNX3 protein was downregulated and DNMT3b and EZH2 were highly expressed in lung tissues and AT2 cells of the model group (P < 0.05), while high DNA methylation and H3K27me3 modifications were present in the RUNX3 promoter region, in lung tissues of the model group (P < 0.05). Following hyperoxia in the model group, JMJD3 and DZNep significantly reversed the hyperoxia-induced down-regulation of RUNX3 expression in AT2 cells (P < 0.05), more so than 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 1) DNA methylation and H3K27 trimethylation are present in the BPD model; 2) RUNX3 down-regulation is attributed to both DNMT3b-catalyzed DNA methylation and EZH2-catalyzed histone methylation.",3.093,540

DESIGN: Microarray analysis of DNA methylation in archived neonatal bloodspots of in vitro fertilization (IVF)/ICSI-conceived children compared with controls born to fertile and infertile parents. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Neonatal blood spots of 137 newborns conceived spontaneously, through intrauterine insemination (IUI), or through ICSI using fresh or cryopreserved (frozen) embryo transfer. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k BeadChip assay determined genome-wide DNA methylation. Methylation differences between conception groups were detected using a Bioconductor package, ChAMP, in conjunction with Adjacent Site Clustering (A-clustering). RESULT(S): The methylation profiles of assisted reproductive technology and IUI newborns were dramatically different from those of naturally (in vivo) conceived newborns. Interestingly, the profiles of ICSI-frozen (FET) and IUI infants were strikingly similar, suggesting that cryopreservation may temper some of the epigenetic aberrations induced by IVF or ICSI. The DNA methylation changes associated with IVF/ICSI culture conditions and/or parental infertility were detected at metastable epialleles, suggesting a lasting impact on a child's epigenome. CONCLUSION(S): Both infertility and ICSI alter DNA methylation at specific genomic loci, an effect that is mitigated to some extent by FET. The impact of assisted reproductive technology and/or fertility status on metastable epialleles in humans was uncovered. This study provides an expanded set of loci for future investigations on IVF populations.",4.59,1547

However, the exact impact of the amount of input templates (TAIT) on DNA methylation analysis has not been previously recognized. Using COL2A1 gene as an input reference, TAIT difference between human tissues with methylation-positive and -negative detection was calculated for two representative genes GFRA1 and P16. Results revealed that TAIT in GFRA1 methylation-positive frozen samples (n = 332) was significantly higher than the methylation-negative ones (n = 44) (P < 0.001). Similar difference was found in P16 methylation analysis. The TAIT-related effect was also observed in methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and denatured high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis. Further study showed that the minimum TAIT for a successful MethyLight PCR reaction should be >/= 9.4 ng (CtCOL2A1 </= 29.3), when the cutoff value of the methylated-GFRA1 proportion for methylation-positive detection was set at 1.6%. After TAIT of the methylation non-informative frozen samples (n = 94; CtCOL2A1 > 29.3) was increased above the minimum TAIT, the methylation-positive rate increased from 72.3% to 95.7% for GFRA1 and 26.6% to 54.3% for P16, respectively (Ps < 0.001). Similar results were observed in the FFPE samples. In conclusion, TAIT critically affects results of various PCR-based DNA methylation analyses. Characterization of the minimum TAIT for target CpG islands is essential to avoid false-negative results.",6.359,521

We set out to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with arsenic and its metabolites in exfoliated urothelial cells (EUCs) that originate primarily from the urinary bladder, one of the targets of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Genome-wide, gene-specific promoter DNA methylation levels were assessed in EUCs from 46 residents of Chihuahua, Mexico, and the relationship was examined between promoter methylation profiles and the intracellular concentrations of total arsenic and arsenic species. A set of 49 differentially methylated genes was identified with increased promoter methylation associated with EUC tAs, iAs, and/or monomethylated As (MMAs) enriched for their roles in metabolic disease and cancer. Notably, no genes had differential methylation associated with EUC dimethylated As (DMAs), suggesting that DMAs may influence DNA methylation-mediated urothelial cell responses to a lesser extent than iAs or MMAs. Further analysis showed that 22 of the 49 arsenic-associated genes (45%) are also differentially methylated in bladder cancer tissue identified using The Cancer Genome Atlas repository. Both the arsenic- and cancer-associated genes are enriched for the binding sites of common transcription factors known to play roles in carcinogenesis, demonstrating a novel potential mechanistic link between iAs exposure and bladder cancer.",3.529,504

BDNF secretion is influenced by epigenetic (DNA methylation) and genetic (val66met polymorphism) profiles. We aimed to investigate the independent effects of BDNF promoter methylation status on suicidal ideation as well as the effects of its interaction with the val66met polymorphism in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A total of279 patients with breast cancer were evaluated 1 week after breast surgery, and 244 (87%) were followed up 1 year later. Suicidal ideation was identified using the item addressing suicidal thoughts on the Beck Depression Inventory. The independent effects of BDNF methylation status on suicidal ideation at two points was investigated using multivariable logistic regression models. The two-way interactive effects of BDNF methylation status and the val66met polymorphism on suicidal ideation were also estimated using the same models. RESULTS: Increased BDNF methylation was significantly associated with suicidal ideation and depression 1 year after breast surgery, and this association was independent of potential covariates, including previous depression, current depressive symptoms, and BDNF genotype. No significant methylation-genotype interactions were found. CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF hypothesis and the epigenetic origin of suicidality in patients with breast cancer were supported.

Previous studies have shown that depletion of DNMT1 causes a severe growth defect and apoptosis in differentiated cells. However, the detailed mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here we show that conditional ablation of Dnmt1 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in an aberrant DNA replication program showing an accumulation of late-S phase replication and causing severely defective growth. Furthermore, we found that the catalytic activity and replication focus targeting sequence of DNMT1 are required for a proper DNA replication program.

Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was used to detect the expression of DNMT1, GSTP1 and APC in 56 samples of PCa tissue and 10 samples of BPH tissue. MethylationspecificPCR was used to detect the methylation status of the CpG island promoters of GSTP1 and APC. The positive rate of expression of DNMT1 in poorlydifferentiated PCa, moderatelydifferentiated PCa, welldifferentiated PCa and BPH was 86.7%, 70.6%, 55.6% and 30.0%, respectively (P<0.05); for GSTP1, the positive rate was 13.3%, 29.4%, 44.4% and 90.0%, respectively (P<0.05); and for APC, the positive rate was 23.3%, 47.6%, 55.6% and 70.0%, respectively (P<0.05). The correlation coefficient for the association between the expression of DNMT1 and GSTP1 was 0.891 (P<0.05). Between the expression of DNMT1 and APC, the correlation coefficient was 0.721 (P<0.05).

The research aims were, first, the description of genes with differential epigenetic regulation obtained by an 'omics' approach in patients with ischemic stroke and, second, to determine the importance of some regions of these selected genes in biological processes depending on the body mass index. A case-control study using two populations was designed. The first population consisted of 24 volunteers according to stroke/non-stroke and normal weight/obesity conditions. The second population included 60 stroke patients and 55 controls classified by adiposity. DNA from the first population was analyzed with a methylation microarray, showing 80 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) sites differentially methylated in stroke and 96 CpGs in obesity, whereas 59 CpGs showed interaction. After validating these data by MassArray Epityper, the promoter region of peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1) gene was significantly hypermethylated in stroke patients. One CpG site at Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) gene showed an interaction between stroke and obesity. Two CpGs located in the genes Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) were significantly hypermethylated in obese patients. In the second population, KCNQ1 was also hypermethylated in the obese subjects. Two CpGs of this gene were subsequently validated by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting. Moreover, KCNQ1 methylation levels were associated with plasma KCNQ1 protein concentrations. In conclusion, obesity induced changes in the KCNQ1 methylation pattern which were also dependent on stroke.

Cardia adenocarcinoma might be a specific entity distinct from the carcinoma of the rest stomach. The aim was to explore putative differences in p16(INK) (4a) -retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway and INK4a/ARF methylation between gastric cardia and distal adenocarcinomas. METHODS: Ninety-six cardia adenocarcinomas and 79 distal samples were analyzed for comparing p16(INK) (4a) -Rb expressions, INK4a/ARF deletion, and methylation using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The expression of p16(INK) (4a) in cardia adenocarcinoma (43.2%) was significantly lower than in distal cases (75.0%, P < 0.05). As well, cardia adenocarcinoma showed lower expression of p14(ARF) compared with distal cases (34.1% vs 57.5%, P < 0.05). The incidence of p16(INK) (4a) deletion was 20.5% and 15.0%, while p14(ARF) deletion was 18.2% and 10.0% in cardia and distal adenocarcinomas, respectively, showing no significant differences between two entities. However, the incidences of p14(ARF) and p16(INK) (4a) methylation in cardia adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than in distal samples (p14(ARF) : 61.5% vs 43.6%; p16(INK) (4a) : 73.1% vs 51.3%, P < 0.05). INK4a/ARF methylations were more prevalent in poorly differentiated cardia carcinoma compared with poorly differentiated distal cases.

SUMMARY ANSWER: DNA methylation, at specific CpGs but not at the global level, was significantly different between low motile sperm cells of asthenozoospermic individuals and high motile sperm cells of normozoospermic controls. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Aberrant DNA methylation, both globally and restricted to a specific gene locus, has been associated with male infertility and abnormal semen parameters. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a case-control study investigating the differences in DNA methylation at CpGs in promoter regions between high and low motile sperm cells from eight normozoospermic controls and seven asthenozoospermic patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing method was used to determine DNA methylation at CpGs in promoter regions. The global inter-individual and intra-individual methylation variability were estimated by evaluating the methylation variance between and within different motile sperm fractions from the same or different individuals. Asthenozoospermia-associated differentially methylated or variable CpGs and differentially methylated regions were identified by comparing the DNA methylation of high motile sperm cells from normozoospermic controls with that of low motile sperm cells from asthenozoospermic patients. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In this study, we determined the global DNA methylation level (24.7%), inter-individual variance (14.4%) and intra-individual differences between high and low motile sperm fractions (3.9%). We demonstrated that there were no statistically signi fi cant differences in either the global DNA methylation level or global methylation variability between sperm from men with normozoospermia or asthenozoospermia. Between high motile sperm from men with normozoospermia and low motile sperm from men with asthenozoospermia, we identified 134 differentially methylated CpGs, 41 differentially methylated regions and 134 differentially variable CpGs. The genomic distribution patterns of the differential methylation spectrum suggested that gene expression may be affected in low motile sperm cells of asthenozoospermic patients. Finally, through a functional analysis, we detected 16 differentially methylated or variable genes that are required for spermatogenesis and sperm motility or dominantly expressed in testis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The sample size in this study was limited, although the participants in the two groups were carefully selected and well matched. Our results must be verified in larger cohorts with the use of different techniques. Furthermore, our results were descriptive, and follow-up studies will be needed to elucidate the effect of differential methylation profiles on asthenozoospermia. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study identified asthenozoospermia-associated DNA methylation profiles and proposed a list of genes, which were suggested to be involved in the regulation of sperm motility through an alteration of DNA methylation. These results will provide promising clues for understanding the effect of DNA methylation on sperm motility and asthenozoospermia.

The role of sperm PP1gamma2 is relatively well studied. Here we confirm the presence of PP2A in sperm and show that it undergoes marked changes in methylation (leucine 309), tyrosine phosphorylation (tyrosine 307) and catalytic activity during epididymal sperm maturation. Spermatozoa isolated from proximal caput, distal caput and caudal regions of the epididymis contain equal immuno-reactive amounts of PP2A. Using demethyl sensitive antibodies we show that PP2A is methylated at its carboxy terminus in sperm from the distal caput and caudal regions but not in sperm from the proximal caput region of the epididymis. The methylation status of PP2A was confirmed by isolation of PP2A with microcystin agarose followed by alkali treatment, which causes hydrolysis of protein carboxy methyl esters. Tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm PP2A varied inversely with methylation. That is, PP2A was tyrosine phosphorylated when it was demethylated but not when methylated. PP2A demethylation and its reciprocal tyrosine phosphorylation were also affected by treatment of sperm with L-homocysteine and adenosine, which are known to elevate intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine, a feedback inhibitor of methyltransferases. Catalytic activity of PP2A declined during epididymal sperm maturation. Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid or by incubation of caudal epididymal spermatozoa with L-homocysteine and adenosine resulted in increase of sperm motility parameters including percent motility, velocity, and lateral head amplitude. Demethylation or pharmacological inhibition of PP2A also leads to an increase in phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). Our results show for the first time that changes in PP2A activity due to methylation and tyrosine phosphorylation occur in sperm and that these changes may play an important role in the regulation of sperm function.",3.234,376

Bi-marker panel MAL/miR-124-2 can be applied directly on self-sampled cervico-vaginal material and its sensitivity is non-inferior to that of cytology, yet at the cost of more colposcopy referrals. Our objective was to increase specificity of MAL/miR-124-2 methylation analysis by varying the assay thresholds and adding HPV16/18 genotyping. METHODS: 1019 hrHPV-positive women were selected from a randomized controlled self-sampling trial (PROHTECT-3; 33-63 years, n=46,001) and nine triage strategies with methylation testing of MAL/miR-124-2 and HPV16/18 genotyping were evaluated. The methylation assay threshold was set at four different predefined levels which correspond with clinical specificities for end-point cervical intra-epithelial grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) of 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%. RESULTS: The CIN3+ sensitivity of methylation analysis decreased (73.5 to 44.9%) while specificity increased (47.2 to 83.4%) when increasing the assay threshold. CIN3+ sensitivity and specificity of HPV16/18 genotyping were 68.0% and 65.6%, respectively. Combined methylation analysis at threshold-80 and HPV16/18 genotyping yielded similar CIN3+ sensitivity as that of methylation only at threshold-50 (77.6%) with an increased specificity (54.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Combined triage by MAL/miR-124-2 methylation analysis with threshold-80 and HPV16/18 genotyping reaches high CIN3+ sensitivity with increased specificity to identify women with cervical (pre)cancer among HPV self-sample positive women. The combined strategy is attractive as it is fully molecular and identifies women at the highest risk of cervical (pre)cancer because of strongly elevated methylation levels and/or HPV16/18 positivity.",3.774,1333

However, their role in specific psychiatric diseases remains poorly understood. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which affect the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes, are critical for our understanding of molecular mechanisms in schizophrenia. Using clinical, imaging, genetic, and epigenetic data of 103 patients with schizophrenia and 111 healthy controls of the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) study of schizophrenia, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis to identify markers for schizophrenia-associated intermediate phenotypes. Genes were ranked based on the correlation between DNA methylation patterns and each phenotype, and then searched for enrichment in 221 predicted microRNA target gene sets. We found the predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target gene set to be significantly enriched for genes (EPHA4, PKNOX1, ESR1, among others) whose methylation status is correlated with hippocampal volume independent of disease status. Our results were strengthened by significant associations between hsa-miR-219a-5p target gene methylation patterns and hippocampus-related neuropsychological variables. IPA pathway analysis of the respective predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target genes revealed associated network functions in behavior and developmental disorders. Altered methylation patterns of predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target genes are associated with a structural aberration of the brain that has been proposed as a possible biomarker for schizophrenia. The (dys)regulation of microRNA target genes by epigenetic mechanisms may confer additional risk for developing psychiatric symptoms. Further study is needed to understand possible interactions between microRNAs and epigenetic changes and their impact on risk for brain-based disorders such as schizophrenia.",3.689,554

We analyzed the DNA methylomes of Arabidopsis Col and C24 ecotypes, and their hybrid progeny. Hybrids displayed nonadditive DNA methylation levels, termed methylation interactions, throughout the genome. Approximately 2,500 methylation interactions occurred at regions where parental DNA methylation levels are similar, whereas almost 1,000 were at differentially methylated regions in parents. Methylation interactions were characterized by an abundance of 24-nt small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway abolished methylation interactions but did not affect the increased biomass observed in hybrid progeny. Methylation interactions correlated with altered genetic variation within the genome, suggesting that they may play a role in genome evolution.",9.674,529
27323854,Tobacco smoking and methylation of genes related to lung cancer development.,"['Gao X', 'Zhang Y', 'Breitling LP', 'Brenner H']",Oncotarget,2016,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and cigarette smoking is the major environmental hazard for its development. This study intended to examine whether smoking could alter methylation of genes at lung cancer risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). By systematic literature review, we selected 75 genomic candidate regions based on 120 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). DNA methylation levels of 2854 corresponding cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) candidates in whole blood samples were measured by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip array in two independent subsamples of the ESTHER study. After correction for multiple testing, we successfully confirmed associations with smoking for one previously identified CpG site within the KLF6 gene and identified 12 novel sites located in 7 genes: STK32A, TERT, MSH5, ACTA2, GATA3, VTI1A and CHRNA5 (FDR <0.05). Current smoking was linked to a 0.74% to 2.4% decrease of DNA methylation compared to never smoking in 11 loci, and all but one showed significant associations (FDR <0.05) with life-time cumulative smoking (pack-years). In conclusion, our study demonstrates the impact of tobacco smoking on DNA methylation of lung cancer related genes, which may indicate that lung cancer susceptibility genes might be regulated by methylation changes in response to smoking. Nevertheless, this mechanism warrants further exploration in future epigenetic and biomarker studies.",6.359,1638

Herein we analyzed the epigenetic regulation of miR-126 and its host gene EGF-like domain, multiple 7 (EGFL7). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded MPM tissues from 29 patients, 14 patient-matched non-neoplastic pleura (NNP) specimens, 5 MPM diagnostic biopsies (DB), and 5 samples of pneumothorax-induced benign reactive mesothelial proliferation (PTHX) were analyzed. miR-126 and EGFL7 mRNA were quantified by RT-qPCR. CpG-islands' methylation in the EGFL7 promoter was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR and in the MIR126-containing intron 7 was quantified by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Relative to NNP, EGFL7 was under-expressed more than 4-fold in MPM (p<0.001). EGFL7 mRNA and miR-126 levels correlated in MPM (p<0.01) and NNP (p<0.001). The EGFL7 promoter region was hypermethylated in 69% of MPM and 80% of DB samples, but not in NNP and PTHX samples. EGFL7 promoter hypermethylation was associated with epithelioid histology (p<0.05) and reduced patient-survival (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In MPM, DNA-hypermethylation down-regulates miR-126 and its host gene EGFL7, therefore is a poor prognostic factor, and may represent a future therapeutic target for de-methylating strategies re-establishing EGFL7 and miR-126 expression.",1.826,1622

However, the effect of the N7 alkylation on the hydrogen-bonding patterns of the guanine remains poorly understood. We prepared N7-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (N7mdG)-containing DNA using a transition-state destabilization strategy, developed a novel polbeta-host-guest complex system, and determined eight crystal structures of N7mdG or dG paired with dC, dT, dG, and dA. The structures of N7mdG:dC and N7mdG:dG are very similar to those of dG:dC and dG:dG, respectively, indicating the involvement of the keto tautomeric form of N7mdG in the base pairings with dC and dG. On the other hand, the structure of N7mdG:dT shows that the mispair forms three hydrogen bonds and adopts a Watson-Crick-like geometry rather than a wobble geometry, suggesting that the enol tautomeric form of N7mdG involves in its base pairing with dT. In addition, N7mdG:dA adopts a novel shifted anti:syn base pair presumably via the enol tautomeric form of N7mdG. The polbeta-host-guest complex structures reveal that guanine-N7 methylation changes the hydrogen-bonding patterns of the guanine when paired with dT or dA and suggest that N7 alkylation may alter the base pairing patterns of guanine by promoting the formation of the rare enol tautomeric form of guanine.",12.113,1438

There is evidence to suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, play a role in placental development and function. This study compared DNA methylation profiles of placentas from preeclampsia-affected pregnancies with placentas from healthy pregnancies to identify gene-specific changes in DNA methylation that may contribute to the development of preeclampsia. The methylation status of eight placental biopsies taken from preeclampsia-affected and 16 healthy pregnancies was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450 BeadChip array. Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to confirm regions found to be differentially methylated between preeclampsia and healthy placentas. A total of 303 differentially methylated regions, 214 hypermethylated and 89 hypomethylated, between preeclampsia cases and controls were identified, after adjusting for gestational age (adjusted P < 0.05). Functional annotation found cell adhesion, wingless type MMTV Integration Site family member 2 (Wnt) signaling pathway, and regulation of transcription were significantly enriched in these gene regions. Hypermethylation of WNT2, sperm equatorial segment protein (SPESP1), NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5), and activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) in preeclampsia placentas was confirmed with pyrosequencing. This study found differences in methylation in gene regions involved in cell signaling (WNT2), fertilization and implantation (SPESP1), reactive oxygen species signaling (NOX5), and cell adhesion (ALCAM).

Developmental BPA exposure in mice previously revealed widespread changes in the mouse liver methylome. Here, we undertake the first epigenome-wide analysis of the effect of BPA concentration on human fetal liver DNA methylation. Enzymatic enrichment of genomic DNA for high CG density and methylation followed by next-generation sequencing yielded data for positional methylation across the genome. Comparing three groups of BPA-exposed subjects (n=18; 6 per group), high (35.44-96.76 ng/g), low (3.50 to 5.79 ng/g), and non-detect (<0.83 ng/g), revealed regions of altered methylation. Similar numbers of regions of altered methylations were detected in pairwise comparisons; however, their genomic locations were distinct between the non-detect and low or high BPA groups. In general, BPA levels were positively associated with methylation in CpG islands and negatively associated with methylation in CpG shores, shelves, and repetitive regions. DNA methylation at the SNORD imprinted cluster (15q11q13) illustrated both linear and non-monotonic associations with BPA levels. Integrated methylation and RNA-sequencing gene expression analysis revealed differential regulation of transcription at low BPA levels, as well as expression changes in RNA for ligand-binding proteins as BPA levels increase. BPA levels in human fetal liver tissue are associated with complex linear and non-monotonic as well as sequence-dependent alterations in DNA methylation. Future longitudinal studies are needed to link these changes with altered health risks.",0,1454

The methylation of a single CpG site in the promoter region of TPH2 affects gene expression. Suicide and MDD are strongly associated and genetic factors are at least partially responsible for the variability in suicide risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variations in TPH2 methylation in peripheral blood samples may predispose patients with MDD to suicide attempts. TPH2 mRNA expression levels differed significantly between 50 patients with MDD who had attempted suicide (MDD + suicide group) and 75 control patients with MDD (MDD group); TPH2 expression levels were significantly decreased (P=0.0005) in the patients who had attempted suicide. Furthermore, the frequency of TPH2 methylation was 36.0% in the MDD + suicide group, while it was 13.0% in the MDD group. The results of the present study demonstrated that methylation in the promoter region of TPH2 significantly affected the mRNA expression levels of TPH2, thus suggesting that methylation of the TPH2 promoter may silence TPH2 mRNA expression in MDD patients with or without suicidal behavior. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the methylation status of the TPH2 promoter and depression, hopelessness and cognitive impairment in the MDD + suicide group. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TPH2 expression was regulated by DNA methylation of the TPH2 promoter region in patients with MDD.",1.554,370

In contrast to promoter methylation, gene body methylation may be important in maintaining active transcription. This study aimed to assess MVRs in ESR1 in breast cancer cell lines, tumour biopsies and exfoliated epithelial cells from expressed breast milk (EBM), to determine their significance for ESR1 transcription. METHODS: DNA methylation levels in eight MVRs across ESR1 were assessed by pyrosequencing bisulphite-converted DNA from three oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive and three ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. DNA methylation and expression were assessed following treatment with DAC (1 muM), or DMSO (controls). ESR1 methylation levels were also assayed in DNA from 155 invasive ductal carcinoma biopsies provided by the Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank, and validated with DNA methylation profiles from the TCGA breast tumours (n = 356 ER-pos, n = 109 ER-neg). DNA methylation was profiled in exfoliated breast epithelial cells from EBM using the Illumina 450 K (n = 36) and pyrosequencing in a further 53 donor samples. ESR1 mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We show that ER-positive cell lines had unmethylated ESR1 promoter regions and highly methylated intragenic regions (median, 80.45%) while ER-negative cells had methylated promoters and lower intragenic methylation levels (median, 38.62%). DAC treatment increased ESR1 expression in ER-negative cells, but significantly reduced methylation and expression of ESR1 in ER-positive cells. The ESR1 promoter was unmethylated in breast tumour biopsies with high levels of intragenic methylation, independent of ER status. However, ESR1 methylation in the strongly ER-positive EBM DNA samples were very similar to ER-positive tumour cell lines. CONCLUSION: DAC treatment inhibited ESR1 transcription in cells with an unmethylated ESR1 promoter and reduced intragenic DNA methylation. Intragenic methylation levels correlated with ESR1 expression in homogenous cell populations (cell lines and exfoliated primary breast epithelial cells), but not in heterogeneous tumour biopsies, highlighting the significant differences between the in vivo tumour microenvironment and individual homogenous cell types. These findings emphasise the need for care when choosing material for epigenetic research and highlights the presence of aberrant intragenic methylation levels in tumour tissue.",3.362,643

Disturbances in DNA methylation have already been implicated in dementia. Homocysteine metabolism, with folate and vitamin B12 as essential cofactors, is integral to methylation processes. We evaluated in a case-control study the association of global DNA methylation, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 status with dementia. Selected polymorphisms of genes previously associated with dementia development and the influence of various factors on DNA methylation were also investigated. 102 patients with dementia (53 with Alzheimer's disease, 17 with vascular dementia and 32 with mixed dementia) were recruited. The non-demented controls consisted of 45 age-matched subjects without dementia and 47 individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Global DNA methylation was determined by Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit MDQ1 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK). Plasma homocysteine, serum folate and vitamin B12 were determined by chemiluminescence. Plasma and erythrocyte 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and plasma methylmalonic acid (markers of folate and vitamin B12 status) were measured by HPLC. APOE, PON1 p.Q192R, MTHFR 677C>T (c.665C>T) and IL1B-511C>T polymorphisms were identified using PCR-RFLP methods. Patients with dementia had significantly higher concentrations of homocysteine (p=0.012) and methylmalonic acid (p=0.016) and lower folate (p=0.002) and plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (p=0.005) than non-demented subjects. There was no difference in DNA methylation between patients and controls. A non-significant tendency to higher DNA methylation in patients with vascular dementia (p=0.061) was observed. Multivariate regression analysis of all recruited individuals demonstrated a significant positive association between DNA methylation and folate (p=0.013), creatinine (p=0.003) concentrations and IL1B-511T (p=0.002) and PON1 192R (p=0.049) alleles and negative association with fasting glucose (p=0.004).

We also examined other prognostic factors for survival of glioblastoma patients. METHODS: The available study set included formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from 104 patients at two institutes from 1997 to 2012, all of which were diagnosed histopathologically as glioblastoma. Clinicopathologic data were collected by review of medical records. For pyrosequencing analysis, the PyroMark Q96 CpG MGMT kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to detect the level of methylation at exon 1 positions 17-39 of the MGMT gene, which contains 5 CpGs. RESULTS: Methylation of the MGMT promoter was detected in 43 (41.3%) of 104 samples. The average percentage methylation was 14.0+/-16.8% overall and 39.0+/-14.7% for methylated cases. There was no significant pattern of linear increase or decrease according to the age of the FFPE block (p=0.687). In multivariate analysis, age, performance status, extent of surgery, method of adjuvant therapy, and methylation status estimated by pyrosequencing were independently associated with overall survival. Additionally, patients with a high level of methylation survived longer than those with low methylation (p=0.016). CONCLUSION: In this study, the status and extent of methylation of the MGMT promoter analyzed by pyrosequencing were associated with overall survival in glioblastoma patients. Pyrosequencing is a quantitative method that overcomes the problems of MSP and a simple technique for accurate analysis of DNA sequences.",0.636,1260

Vestibular schwannomas can present unilaterally and sporadically or bilaterally when the tumor is associated with neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) syndrome. The molecular hallmark of the disease is biallelic inactivation of the NF2 gene. The epigenetic signature of schwannomas remains poorly understood and is mostly limited to DNA methylation of the NF2 gene, whose altered expression due to epigenetic factors in this tumor is controversial. In this study, we tested the genomewide DNA methylation pattern of schwannomas to shed light on this epigenetic alteration in these particular tumors. The methodology used includes Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip microarrays in a series of 36 vestibular schwannomas, 4 nonvestibular schwannomas, and 5 healthy nerves. Our results show a trend toward hypomethylation in schwannomas. Furthermore, homeobox (HOX) genes, located at four clusters in the genome, displayed hypomethylation in several CpG sites in the vestibular schwannomas but not in the nonvestibular schwannomas. Several microRNA (miRNA) and protein-coding genes were also found to be hypomethylated at promoter regions and were confirmed as upregulated by expression analysis; including miRNA-21, Met Proto-Oncogene (MET), and PMEPA1. We also detected methylation patterns that might be involved in alternative transcripts of several genes such as NRXN1 or MBP, which would increase the complexity of the methylation and expression patterns. Overall, our results show specific epigenetic signatures in several coding genes and miRNAs that could potentially be used as therapeutic targets.",4.041,1687

In the present study, the methylation status of the GSTP1 and RASSF1A promoters was evaluated in prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues from Vietnamese men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The accuracy of methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was validated to analyze the methylation pattern of GSTP1 and RASSF1A in 59 PCa and 37 BPH patients, respectively. The methylation status was confirmed by the sequencing of cloned MSP products. The association between methylation status and the clinical and pathological parameters of tumors was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The methylation of GSTP1 and RASSF1A was detected in 39/59 and 19/59 PCa patients and in 4/37 and 10/37 BPH patients, respectively. The methylation frequency of GSTP1 was significantly associated with PCa (P < 0.01).

The aim of the present study was to examine the DNA methylation profile of selected genes in blood spots from neonates later diagnosed with OCD and in the same children/adolescents at the time of diagnosis compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Furthermore, we wanted to characterize the association of the differential methylation profiles with the severity of OCD and treatment outcome. Dried and new blood spot samples were obtained from 21 female children/adolescents with verified OCD and 12 female controls. The differential methylation was analyzed using a linear model and the correlation with the severity of OCD and treatment outcome was analyzed using the Pearson correlation. We evaluated selected Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip probes within and up to 100,000 bp up- and downstream of 14 genes previously associated with OCD (SLC1A1, SLC25A12, GABBR1, GAD1, DLGAP1, MOG, BDNF, OLIG2, NTRK2 and 3, ESR1, SL6A4, TPH2, and COMT).

Methylome assessment, utilizing methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and paired-end sequencing, was performed in DNA obtained from brain tissue of classical PKU patients, leukocytes from poorly controlled PKU patients, leukocytes from well controlled PKU patients, and appropriate control tissues. In PKU brain tissue, expression analysis determined the impact of methylation on gene function. Differential methylation was observed in brain tissue of PKU patients and expression studies identified downstream impact on gene expression. Altered patterns of methylation were observed in leukocytes of well controlled and poorly controlled patients with more extensive methylation in patients with high PHE exposure. Differential methylation of noncoding RNA genes was extensive in patients with high PHE exposure but minimal in well controlled patients.

Of particular concern is the percentage of young women diagnosed with breast cancer; roughly 20% of all breast cancer diagnoses in Turkey are in women younger than 40 years. Increased DNA methylation in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes is a promising molecular biomarker, and human milk provides exfoliated breast epithelial cells appropriate for DNA methylation analyses. Comparisons between DNA methylation patterns in epithelial (epithelial-enriched) and nonepithelial (epithelial-depleted) cell fractions from breast milk have not been reported previously. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we examined promoter methylation of 3 tumor suppressor genes in epithelial-enriched and epithelial-depleted cell fractions isolated from breast milk of 43 Turkish women. METHODS: Percentage methylation in the promoter region of Rass association domain family 1 (RASSF1), secreted frizzle related protein 1 (SFRP1), and glutathione-S-transferase class pi 1 was determined by pyrosequencing of the epithelial-enriched and epithelial-depleted cell fractions. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing identified a few subjects with significantly increased methylation in 1 or more genes. There was little correlation between the 2 cell fractions within individuals; only 1 woman had increased methylation for 1 gene (SFRP1) in both her enriched and depleted cell fractions. Methylation was positively associated with age for SFRP1 (epithelial-depleted fraction) and with body mass index for RASSF1 (epithelial-enriched cell fraction), respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, results show that the methylation signals vary between different cell types in breast milk and suggest that breast milk can be used to assess DNA methylation patterns associated with increased breast cancer risk.",2.7,1108

The aim of this study was to evaluate the promoter methylation status of MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) and a possible correlation with the expression of MGMT and standard clinicopathological parameters in invasive ductal breast carcinoma patients (IDC) of Kashmir. Methylation-specific PCR was carried out to investigate the promoter methylation status of MGMT in breast tumors paired with the corresponding normal tissue samples from 128 breast cancer patients. The effect of promoter methylation on protein expression in the primary breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (n = 128) and western blotting (n = 30). The frequency of tumor hypermethylation was 39.8 % and a significant difference in methylation frequency among breast tumors were found (p < 0.001) when compared with the corresponding normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis showed no detectable expression of MGMT in 68/128 (53.1 %) tumors. MGMT promoter methylation mediated gene silencing was associated with loss of its protein expression (rs = -0.285, p = 0.001, OR = 3.38, 95 % CI = 1.59-7.17). A significant correlation was seen between loss of MGMT and lymph node involvement (p = 0.030), tumor grade (p < 0.0001), loss of estrogen receptors (ER; p = 0.021) and progesterone receptors (PR) (p = 0.016).

 Society",2014,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which environmental factors influence disease risk and may act via an epigenetic mechanism. The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is a susceptibility gene for idiopathic PD. Methylation levels were determined by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA in a leukocyte cohort (358 PD patients and 1084 controls) and in two brain cohorts (Brain1, comprising 69 cerebellum controls; and Brain2, comprising 3 brain regions from 28 PD patients and 12 controls). In vitro assays involved the transfection of methylated promoter-luciferase constructs or treatment with an exogenous micronutrient. In normal leukocytes, the MAPT H1/H2 diplotype and sex were predictors of MAPT methylation. Haplotype-specific pyrosequencing confirmed that the H1 haplotype had higher methylation than the H2 haplotype in normal leukocytes and brain tissues. MAPT methylation was negatively associated with MAPT expression in the Brain1 cohort and in transfected cells. Methylation levels differed between three normal brain regions (Brain2 cohort, putamen < cerebellum < anterior cingulate cortex). In PD samples, age at onset was positively associated with MAPT methylation in leukocytes. Moreover, there was hypermethylation in the cerebellum and hypomethylation in the putamen of PD patients compared with controls (Brain2 cohort). Finally, leukocyte methylation status was positively associated with blood vitamin E levels, and the effect was more significant in H2 haplotype carriers; this result was confirmed in cells that were exposed to 100 muM vitamin E. The significant effects of sex, diplotype, and brain region suggest that hypermethylation of the MAPT gene is neuroprotective by reducing MAPT expression. The effect of vitamin E on MAPT represents a possible gene-environment interaction.",5.68,1115
27436122,Comparative pan-cancer DNA methylation analysis reveals cancer common and specific patterns.,[],Briefings in bioinformatics,2016,"Abnormal DNA methylation is an important epigenetic regulator involving tumorigenesis. Deciphering cancer common and specific DNA methylation patterns is essential for us to understand the mechanisms of tumor development. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project provides a large number of samples of different cancers that enable a pan-cancer study of DNA methylation possible. Here we investigate cancer common and specific DNA methylation patterns among 5480 DNA methylation profiles of 15 cancer types from TCGA. We first define differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) in each cancer and then identify 5450 hyper- and 4433 hypomethylated pan-cancer DMCs (PDMCs). Intriguingly, three adjacent hypermethylated PDMC constitute an enhancer region, which potentially regulates two tumor suppressor genes BVES and PRDM1 negatively. Moreover, we identify six distinct motif clusters, which are enriched in hyper- or hypomethylated PDMCs and are associated with several well-known cancer hallmarks. We also observe that PDMCs relate to distinct transcriptional groups. Additionally, 55 hypermethylated and 7 hypomethylated PDMCs are significantly associated with patient survival. Lastly, we find that cancer-specific DMCs are enriched in known cancer genes and cell-type-specific super-enhancers. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive investigation and reveals meaningful cancer common and specific DNA methylation patterns.",9.617,906

 Association for Cancer Research",2015,"PURPOSE: In this era of molecular diagnostics, prediction of clear-cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) survival requires optimization, as current prognostic markers fail to determine individual patient outcome. Epigenetic events are promising molecular markers. Promoter CpG island methylation of cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1), which was identified as prognostic marker for breast cancer, is studied as a potential marker for ccRCC survival. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We collected primary tissues of 365 ccRCC cases identified within the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). In this population-based series, CDO1 promoter methylation was observed in 124 of 324 (38.3%) patients with successful methylation-specific PCR analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves and Wilcoxon tests were used to evaluate 10-year ccRCC-specific survival. Cox regression analysis was used to obtain crude and multivariate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The relative prognostic value of multivariate models with and without CDO1 promoter methylation was compared using likelihood-ratio tests. RESULTS: Patients with CDO1 promoter methylation have a significantly poorer survival than those without (Wilcoxon P = 0.006). Differences in survival were independent of other prognostic factors, including age and sex (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.12-2.45) and TNM stage, tumor size, and Fuhrman grade (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.25-2.85). Multivariate models performed better with than without CDO1 promoter methylation status (likelihood-ratio P = 0.003). Survival curves were validated in an independent series of 280 ccRCC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; Wilcoxon P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CDO1 promoter methylation may not substitute common prognostic makers to predict ccRCC survival, but offers additional, relevant prognostic information, indicating that it might be a novel molecular marker to determine ccRCC prognosis.",8.722,354

In plants, DNA methylation is not only critical for transcriptionally silencing transposons, but can also affect phenotype by altering expression of protein coding genes. The extent of its contribution to phenotypic diversity over evolutionary time is, however, unclear, because of limited stability of epialleles that are not linked to DNA mutations. To dissect the relative contribution of DNA methylation to transposon surveillance and host gene regulation, we leveraged information from three species in the Brassicaceae that vary in genome architecture, Capsella rubella, Arabidopsis lyrata, and Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the lineage-specific expansion and contraction of transposon and repeat sequences is the main driver of interspecific differences in DNA methylation. The most heavily methylated portions of the genome are thus not conserved at the sequence level. Outside of repeat-associated methylation, there is a surprising degree of conservation in methylation at single nucleotides located in gene bodies. Finally, dynamic DNA methylation is affected more by tissue type than by environmental differences in all species, but these responses are not conserved. The majority of DNA methylation variation between species resides in hypervariable genomic regions, and thus, in the context of macroevolution, is of limited phenotypic consequence.",7.528,1535

This study investigated whether DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression was associated with TMZ sensitivity in glioma cells and elucidated the underlying mechanism. DNMT expression was analyzed by western blotting. miR-20a promoter methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assays, respectively. The results showed that compared with parental U251 cells, DNMT1 expression was downregulated, miR-20a promoter methylation was attenuated and miR-20a levels were elevated in TMZ-resistant U251 cells. Methyltransferase inhibition by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment reduced TMZ sensitivity in U251 cells. In U251/TM cells, DNMT1 expression was negatively correlated with miR-20a expression and positively correlated with TMZ sensitivity and leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 expression; these effects were reversed by changes in miR-20a expression. DNMT1 overexpression induced an increase in U251/TM cell apoptosis that was inhibited by the miR-20a mimic, whereas DNMT1 silencing attenuated U251/TM cell apoptosis in a manner that was abrogated by miR-20a inhibitor treatment. Tumor growth of the U251/TM xenograft was inhibited by pcDNA-DNMT1 pretreatment and boosted by DNMT1-small hairpin RNA pretreatment. In summary, DNMT1 mediated chemosensitivity by reducing methylation of the microRNA-20a promoter in glioma cells.",0,1606

Six differentially-methylated genes identified using the 27K methylation array were screened in the human RCC 786-0 cell line and normal kidney tissues by bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) that were abnormally hypermethylated in the cell line were further validated in renal tumor and paired normal tissues by pyrosequencing. The correlations between DMRs and differences (methylation rate of tumor minus that of paired normal tissue) according to gender, age, tumor size, Fuhrman grade and disease stage were assessed. Gene expression prior to and following 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment was examined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Two DMRs located in the FBXW10 and SMPD3 genes were found to be hypermethylated in the 786-0 cells, but not in the normal kidney tissues. Pyrosequencing results showed that the average methylation rate of FBXW10 in the cancer tissues was significantly higher compared to that in the paired normal tissues (48.78 vs. 34.62%; P<0.001). The methylation rate of SMPD3 was also higher in the cancer tissues compared with the paired normal tissues (58.98 vs. 38.66%; P<0.001). In stage T1 RCC, the methylation rate of the tumor tissue was positively correlated with the Fuhrman grade (P=0.02). The difference in methylation between the tumor and normal tissues was significantly higher in the group with high Fuhrman grade for the two genes. Furthermore, the linear correlation between methylation difference and tumor size was also confirmed (P=0.01). The RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that SMPD3 and FBXW10 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated following 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment.

To determine and investigate the functions of the dynamic DNA methylome during seed development, we profiled the DNA methylation genome wide in a series of developmental stages of rice (Oryza sativa) embryo and endosperm by methylcytosine immunoprecipitation followed by Illumina sequencing. The results showed that embryo is hypermethylated predominantly around non-transposable element (TE) genes, short DNA-TEs, and short interspersed TEs compared with endosperm, and non-TE genes have the most diverse methylation status across seed development. In addition, lowly expressed genes are significantly enriched in hypermethylated genes, but not vice versa, confirming the crucial role of DNA methylation in suppressing gene transcription. Further analysis revealed the significantly decreased methylation at early developing stages (from 2 to 3 d after pollination), indicating a predominant role of demethylation during early endosperm development and that genes with a consistent negative correlation between DNA methylation change and expression change may be potentially directly regulated by DNA methylation. Interestingly, comparative analysis of the DNA methylation profiles revealed that both rice indica and japonica subspecies showed robust fluctuant profiles of DNA methylation levels in embryo and endosperm across seed development, with the highest methylation level at 6 d after pollination (2 d after pollination of endosperm in japonica as well), indicating that a complex and finely controlled methylation pattern is closely associated with seed development regulation. The systemic characterization of the dynamic DNA methylome in developing rice seeds will help us understand the effects and mechanism of epigenetic regulation in seed development.",6.841,367

METHODS: Human cartilage samples were collected from patients undergoing total hip/knee joint replacement surgery due to primary osteoarthritis (OA), and from patients with hip fractures as controls. DNA/RNA was extracted from the cartilage tissues. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to measure gene expression, and Sequenom EpiTyper was used to assay DNA methylation. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the methylation and expression levels between OA cases and controls. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to examine the association between the methylation and gene expression. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients with OA (36 women, 22 men; mean age 64 +/- 9 yrs) and 55 controls (43 women, 12 men; mean age 79 +/- 10 yrs) were studied. SMAD3 expression was on average 83% higher in OA cartilage than in controls (p = 0.0005). No difference was observed for DNA methylation levels in the SMAD3 promoter region between OA cases and controls. No correlation was found between SMAD3 expression and promoter DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that SMAD3 is significantly overexpressed in OA. This overexpression cannot be explained by DNA methylation in the promoter region. The results suggest that the transforming growth factor-beta/SMAD3 pathway may be overactivated in OA cartilage and has potential in developing targeted therapies for OA.",0,1087

To study the role of miRNAs in aging, studies have profiled the levels of miRNAs with time. However, evidence suggests that miRNAs show heterogeneity in length and sequence in different biological contexts. Here, by examining the expression pattern of miRNAs by Northern blot analysis, we found that Drosophila miRNAs show distinct isoform pattern changes with age. Surprisingly, an increase of some miRNAs reflects increased 2'-O-methylation of select isoforms. Small RNA deep sequencing revealed a global increase of miRNAs loaded into Ago2, but not into Ago1, with age. Our data suggest increased loading of miRNAs into Ago2, but not Ago1, with age, indicating a mechanism for differential loading of miRNAs with age between Ago1 and Ago2. Mutations in Hen1 and Ago2, which lack 2'-O-methylation of miRNAs, result in accelerated neurodegeneration and shorter life span, suggesting a potential impact of the age-associated increase of 2'-O-methylation of small RNAs on age-associated processes. Our study highlights that miRNA 2'-O-methylation at the 3' end is modulated by differential partitioning of miRNAs between Ago1 and Ago2 with age and that this process, along with other functions of Ago2, might impact age-associated events in Drosophila.",10.798,1827

Recent findings have revealed that hormone stimulation of certain nuclear receptors induces rapid, dynamic changes in DNA methylation patterns alongside transcriptional responses at a subset of target loci, over time. However, the ability of androgen receptor (AR) to dynamically regulate gene transcription is relatively under-studied and its role in the regulation of DNA methylation patterns remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate in normal prostate cells that hormone stimulated AR activity results in dynamic changes in the transcription rate and DNA methylation patterns at the AR target genes, TIPARP and SGK1. Time-resolved chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on the SGK1 locus reveals dynamic recruitment of AR and RNA Polymerase II, as well as the recruitment of proteins involved in the DNA demethylation process, TET1 and TDG. Furthermore, the presence of DNA methylation at dynamic regions inhibits protein binding and transcriptional activity of SGK1. These findings establish AR activity as a contributing factor to the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns at target genes in prostate biology and infer further complexity involved in nuclear receptor mediation of transcriptional regulation.",6.359,1903

Here, on account of the regulatory role of m(5)C, we evaluate the content of m(5)C in DNA from normal and wound-damaged maize leaves.

We previously showed that loss of all H3K4 and H3K36 methylation in a set1Deltaset2Delta mutant reduces interaction between native nucleosomes and the NuA4 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) complex. We now provide evidence that NuA4 preferentially binds H3 tails mono- and dimethylated on H3K4 and di- and trimethylated on H3K36, an H3 methylation pattern distinct from that recognized by the RPD3C(S) and Hos2/Set3 histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Loss of H3K4 or H3K36 methylation in set1Delta or set2Delta mutants reduces NuA4 interaction with bulk nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo, and reduces NuA4 occupancy of transcribed coding sequences at particular genes. We also provide evidence that NuA4 acetylation of lysine residues in the histone H4 tail stimulates SAGA interaction with nucleosomes and its recruitment to coding sequences and attendant acetylation of histone H3 in vivo. Thus, H3 methylation exerts opposing effects of enhancing nucleosome acetylation by both NuA4 and SAGA as well as stimulating nucleosome deacetylation by multiple HDACs to maintain the proper level of histone acetylation in transcribed coding sequences.",0,211

Here we performed a systematic review on DNA methylation-based biomarkers published in CRC, and discussed the current state of findings and future challenges. Based on the findings, we then provide a perspective on future studies. Genome-wide studies on DNA methylation revealed novel biomarkers as well as distinct subgroups that exist in CRC. For diagnostic purposes, the most independently validated genes to study further are VIM, SEPT9, ITGA4, OSM4, GATA4 and NDRG4. These hypermethylated biomarkers can even be combined with LINE1 hypomethylation and the performance of markers should be examined in comparison to FIT further to find sensitive combinations. In terms of prognostic markers, myopodin, KISS1, TMEFF2, HLTF, hMLH1, APAF1, BCL2 and p53 are independently validated. Most prognostic markers published lack both a multivariate analysis in comparison to clinical risk factors and the appropriate patient group who will benefit by adjuvant chemotherapy. Methylation of IGFBP3, mir148a and PTEN are found to be predictive markers for 5-FU and EGFR therapy respectively. For therapy prediction, more studies should focus on finding markers for chemotherapeutic drugs as majority of the patients would benefit. Translation of these biomarkers into clinical utility would require large-scale prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials in future. Based on these findings and consideration we propose an avenue to introduce methylation markers into clinical practice in near future. For future studies, multi-omics profiling on matched tissue and non-invasive cohorts along with matched cohorts of adenoma to carcinoma is indispensable to concurrently stratify CRC and find novel, robust biomarkers. Moreover, future studies should examine the timing and heterogeneity of methylation as well as the difference in methylation levels between epithelial and stromal tissues.",4.381,428

We investigated if a prognostic DNA methylation profile could be found in tumour tissue from a single uniform subsite, the oral tongue. The methylation status of 109 comprehensively annotated oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from a single institution were examined with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K (HM450K) array. Data pre-processing, quality control and analysis were performed using R packages. Probes mapping to SNPs, sex chromosomes and unreliable probes were accounted for prior to downstream analyses. The relationship between methylation and patient survival was examined using both agnostic approaches and feature selection. The cohort was enlarged by incorporation of 331 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC samples, which included 91 TCGA OTSCC samples with HM450K and survival data available. RESULTS: Given the use of FFPE-derived DNA, we defined different cohorts for separate analyses. Overall, similar results were found between cohorts. With an unsupervised approach, no distinct hypermethylated group of samples was identified and nor was a prognostic methylation profile identified. The use of multiple downstream feature selection approaches, including a linear models for microarray data (LIMMA), centroid feature selection (CFS), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) support vector machines, similarly failed to identify a significant methylation signature informative for patient prognosis or any clinicopathological data available. Furthermore, we were unable to confirm the prognostic methylation profiles or specific prognostic loci reported within the literature for HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: With genome-scale assessment of DNA methylation using HM450K in one of the largest OTSCC cohorts to date, we were unable to identify a hypermethylated group of tumours or a prognostic methylation signature. This suggests that either DNA methylation in isolation is not likely to be of prognostic value or larger cohorts are required to identify such a biomarker for OTSCC.",4.543,1298

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) is a method to assess the functional status of a patient. We retrospectively evaluated the relationship between ECOG-PS and LINE-1 methylation in colorectal cancers (CRCs) and their prognostic impact in CRC or colon cancer patients receiving adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). RESULTS: LINE-1 methylation and microsatellite instability were analyzed in stage III or high-risk stage II CRCs (n = 336). LINE-1 methylation levels were correlated with clinicopathological features, including PS and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The association between the tumoral LINE-1 methylation level and PS was observed (OR = 2.56, P < 0.001). Differences in LINE-1 methylation levels in cancer tissue between the PS 0 and 1 groups were significant in patients older than 60 years (P = 0.001), the overweight body mass index group (P = 0.005), and the stage III disease group (P = 0.008). Prognostic significances of LINE-1 methylation status or combined PS and LINE-1 methylation statuses were identified in stage III colon cancers, not in stage III and high-risk stage II CRCs. Low LINE-1 methylation status was closely associated with a shorter RFS time. The difference between PS(0)/LINE-1(high) and PS(>/=1)/LINE-1(low) was significant, which suggests that colon cancer patients with concurrent PS(>/=1)/LINE-1 (low) have a higher recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS: PS was associated with LINE-1 methylation in CRC tissue. LINE-1 methylation was associated with RFS in stage III colon cancer patients who were treated with adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy. Combined PS and LINE-1 methylation status might serve as a useful predictor of cancer recurrence.",4.543,1254

In this study, we report the global changes observed on the CpG islands distributed in promoters, gene bodies, and intergenic regions and the major biochemical pathways and genes involved in methylation changes as H9-hESCs turn into a neuronal culture containing medium-sized spiny striatal neurons (MSNs). Using an ontogeny-recapitulating protocol of striatal neuron differentiation, we analyzed DNA methylation profiles during the conversion from pluripotency to neuropotency up to the acquisition of a mature neuronal phenotype. H9-hESCs changed the methylation pattern both through de novo methylation and hypomethylation of specific gene promoters. Bioinformatic analysis allowed us to identify a panel of striatal-associated genes, which were regulated by DNA methylation and differentially expressed during striatal commitment. Importantly, DNA methylation analysis revealed that H9-hESCs did not acquire methylation-based oncogenic properties after differentiation. Indeed, hypermethylation of cancer-associated genes that characterize transformed cells, such as Polycomb repressive complex-associated genes, was not detected in the neuronal cultures. However, the oncosuppressor gene, BCL2L11, became hypermethylated in H9-hESC-derived mature neurons.

The mRNA expression levels of survivin, c- myc and cyclin- D1 were analyzed by RT- PCR. Western blot was used to detect the levels of beta-catenin protein. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the different concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR could significantly inhibit the proliferation of Jurkat cells in a time-dose dependent manner (P<0.05). After being treated by 5- Aza- CdR for 48 hours, the cell early apoptosis rate in experiment group was significantly higher than that in control group (P<0.05). The promoters of SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, SFRP5 genes were hypermethylation state in the control group, after being treated by 5-Aza-CdR for 72 hours, the brightness of SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, SFRP5 genes' methylation strips weakened in a dose- dependent manner. SFRP mRNA expression increased (P<0.05) when 5- Aza- CdR concentration increased, and the level of beta- catenin protein was dampened in a dose- dependent manner (P<0.05). As compared to the control group, the mRNA expressions of associated apoptosis genes survivin, c-myc and cyclin- D1, respectively were obviously down- regulated in a dose- dependent manner (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The effect of demethylation could up- regulate SFRP genes expressions by reversing its hypermethylation and induced apoptosis by down-regulation of beta-catenin and associated apoptosis genes.",0,985

METHODS: Established preeclampsia-like mouse models in different ways and divided into groups as follows: (1) Nw-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) group: wild-type pregnant mouse received subcutaneous injection of L-NAME; (2) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group: wild-type pregnant mouse received intraperitoneal injection of LPS; (3) apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC3) group: ApoC3 transgenic pregnant mouse with dysregulated lipid metabolism received subcutaneous injection of L-NAME; (4) beta2 glycoprotein I (beta-2GPI) group: wild-type pregnant mouse received subcutaneous injection of beta-2GPI. According to the first injection time (on day 3, 11, 16 respectively), the L-NAME, LPS and ApoC3 groups were further subdivided into: pre-implantation (PI) experimental stage, early gestation (EG) experimental stage, and late gestation (LG) experimental stage. beta-2GPI group was only injected before implantation. LCHAD gene methylation levels in placental were detected in different experimental stage. Normal saline control groups were set within wild-type and ApoC3 transgenic pregnant mice simultaneously. RESULTS: (1) CG sites in LCHAD DNA: 45 CG sites were detected in the range of 728 bp before LCHAD gene transcription start site, the 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 43 CG sites were complex sites which contained two or more CG sequences, others were single site which contained one CG sequence. The 3, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 18, 28 sites in L-NAME, LPS, ApoC3 and beta-2GPI groups showed different high levels of methylation; the 16, 25, 31, 42, 44 sites showed different low levels of methylation; other 32 sites were unmethylated. (2) Comparison of LCHAD gene methylation between different groups: the methylation levels of LCAHD gene at 3, 11, 13, 14, 18 sites in L-NAME, LPS, ApoC3 and beta-2GPI groups were significantly higher than those in the normal saline control group (P < 0.05); and the methylation levels of 42, 44 sites in these groups were significantly lower than those in the normal saline control group (P < 0.05). (3) Methylation of LCHAD gene at the same site between different experimental stages: 1 in circle The 3, 11, 18 sites of EG experimental stage was significantly lower than PI and LG experimental stage in L-NAME group (P < 0.05); the 3, 11, 18 sites of PI experimental stage was significantly lower than EG and LG experimental stage in LPS group (P < 0.05); these sites of PI experimental stage was significantly higher than EG and LG experimental stages in ApoC3 group (P < 0.05). 2 in circle The methylation of site 5 in L-NAME and LPS groups were significantly higher than that of the normal saline control group (P < 0.05), and the LG experimental stages were significantly higher than other stages, but in ApoC3 group, only PI and EG stages were significantly higher than the normal saline control group (P < 0.05). 3 in circle At site 6 in L-NAME group which showed high methylation level was significantly higher than the same site in other groups which showed low methylation level (P < 0.05). 4 in circle At 13, 14 sites, earlier preeclampsia onset caused a lower methylation level in L-NAME group, but PI experimental stage was significantly higher than EG and LG experimental stages in LPS group (P < 0.05), EG experimental stage was significantly higher than PI and LG experimental stages in ApoC3 group (P < 0.05).  At site 28, earlier preeclampsia onset caused a higher methylation level in L-NAME group, but PI experimental stage was significantly lower than EG and LG experimental stages in LPS group (P < 0.05), EG experimental stage was significantly higher than PI and LG experimental stages in ApoC3 group (P < 0.05).  The 16, 25, 31 sites in ApoC3 group were significantly higher than other groups (P < 0.05).  At site 42 in beta-2GPI group was unmethylated, but it in other groups showed low methylation level, the methylation level of site 42 in beta-2GPI group was significantly lower than that in other groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The methylation of 6 and 42 CG sites may be related to LCHAD gene expression in placenta of L-NAME and beta-2GPI induced preeclampsia-like models respectively; LCHAD gene expression and DNA methylation may not have obvious correlation in LPS and ApoC3 induced preeclampsia-like models.

In this review, we summarize studies conducted by us in Vietnam and by others on the association of AS3MT genetic polymorphisms with arsenic metabolism as well as human health effects. Most of the SNPs in AS3MT showed inconsistent results in terms of genotype-dependent differences in arsenic metabolism among the studies. However, AS3MT 12390 (rs3740393) and 14458 (rs11191439) were consistently related to arsenic methylation regardless of the study population: AS3MT 12390 (rs3740393) affected the second step of methylation of arsenic, whereas 14458 (rs11191439) affected the first methylation step.",0,683

The gene mainly related to pathology is the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2). The aim of this study was to analyze the methylation pattern of the BMPR2 promoter region in patients and controls. METHODS: We used Methyl Primer Express(R) v.1.0 and MatInspector softwares to analyze this region. Genomic DNA obtained from the peripheral blood of patients and controls was modified with sodium bisulphite. Methylation was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR. DNA treated with CpG methyltransferase was used as a positive control for methylation and H1299 cell culture DNA was used as positive control for gene expression. RESULTS: We identified a CpG island, which may have been methylated, in the BMPR2 promoter region, in addition to NIT-2 (global-acting regulatory protein), sex-determining region Y) and heat shock factor transcription factor binding sites. We found no evidence of methylation in patients and controls. No methylated CpG sites were identified in H1299 cells expressing the BMPR2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The BMPR2 promoter region is the most suitable for study because of the high number of transcription factor binding sites that could alter gene function. No evidence of methylation was detected in this region in patients and controls.",1.823,1027

The lack of a genetic marker for microbial MeHg production has prevented a clear understanding of Hg-methylating organism distribution in nature. Recently, a specific gene cluster (hgcAB) was linked to Hg methylation in two bacteria.1 Here we test if the presence of hgcAB orthologues is a reliable predictor of Hg methylation capability in microorganisms, a necessary confirmation for the development of molecular probes for Hg-methylation in nature. Although hgcAB orthologues are rare among all available microbial genomes, organisms are much more phylogenetically and environmentally diverse than previously thought. By directly measuring MeHg production in several bacterial and archaeal strains encoding hgcAB, we confirmed that possessing hgcAB predicts Hg methylation capability. For the first time, we demonstrated Hg methylation in a number of species other than sulfate- (SRB) and iron- (FeRB) reducing bacteria, including methanogens, and syntrophic, acetogenic, and fermentative Firmicutes. Several of these species occupy novel environmental niches for Hg methylation, including methanogenic habitats such as rice paddies, the animal gut, and extremes of pH and salinity. Identification of these organisms as Hg methylators now links methylation to discrete gene markers in microbial communities.",5.33,1921

It was found reduced in PD brains, CSF and saliva, although there were conflicting results. How DJ-1 expression may be regulated is not clear. Recently, blood-based DNA methylation represents a highly promising biomarker for PD by regulating the causative gene expression. Thus, in this study, we try to explore whether blood-based DNA methylation of DJ-1 could be used as a biomarker to differentiate PD patients from normal control (NC), and whether DNA methylation could regulate DJ-1 expression in a SH-SY5Y cell model. METHODS: Forty PD patients and 40 NC were recruited in this study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Methylation status of two CpG islands (CpG1 and CpG2) in promoter region of DJ-1 was explored by bisulfite specific PCR-based sequencing method. Methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-dC was used to treat SH-SY5Y cell line, DJ-1 level was detected in both mRNA and protein level. RESULTS: CpG sites in these two CpG islands (CpG1 and CpG2) of DJ-1 were unmethylated in both PD and NC group. In SH-SY5Y cell model treated by methylation inhibitor, there was no significant change of DJ-1 expression in either mRNA level or protein level. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that DNA methylation inhibitor didn't alter DJ-1 gene expression in SH-SY5Y cell model, and DNA methylation of DJ-1 promoter region in PBLs level might not be an efficient biomarker for PD patients.",0.185,1305

However, sera methylation of specific genes in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC remains unknown. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to identify methylation frequencies of sera E-cadherin (CDH1), DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) promoter in HBV-related HCC and analyze the associated clinical significance. METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the frequencies of DNA methylation for CDH1, DNMT3b and ESR1 genes in sera from 183 patients with HCC, 47 liver cirrhosis (LC), 126 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 50 normal controls (NCs). RESULTS: Significantly higher frequencies of methylation of CDH1, DNMT3b and ESR1 were found in HBV-related HCC compared with LC, CHB and NCs. Nodule numbers, tumor size and the presence of liver cirrhosis were significantly associated with gene methylation status in HBV-related HCC. Moreover, HBV may have a strong and enhanced effect on the concurrent methylation of CDH1, DNMT3b and ESR1 in HBV-related HCC. More importantly, combined methylation as a biomarker displayed significantly higher diagnostic value than AFP to discriminate HCC from CHB and LC.

However, the developmental mechanism of SSA/P remains unknown. We performed genetic analysis and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in aberrant crypt foci (ACF), SSA/P, and cancer in SSA/P specimens to show a close association between ACF and the SSA/P-cancer sequence. We also evaluated the prevalence and number of ACF in SSA/P patients. METHODS: ACF in the right-side colon were observed in 36 patients with SSA/Ps alone, 2 with cancers in SSA/P, and 20 normal subjects and biopsied under magnifying endoscopy. B-RAF mutation and MSI were analysed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and PCR-SSCP, respectively, in 15 ACF, 20 SSA/P, and 2 cancer specimens. DNA methylation array analysis of seven ACF, seven SSA/P, and two cancer in SSA/P specimens was performed using the microarray-based integrated analysis of methylation by isochizomers (MIAMI) method. RESULTS: B-RAF mutations were frequently detected in ACF, SSA/P, and cancer in SSA/P tissues. The number of methylated genes increased significantly in the order of ACF<SSA/P<cancer. The most commonly methylated genes in SSA/P were PQLC1, HDHD3, RASL10B, FLI1, GJA3, and SLC26A2. Some of these genes were methylated in ACF, whereas all genes were methylated in cancers. Immunohistochemistry revealed their silenced expression. Microsatellite instability and MLH1 methylation were observed only in cancer. The prevalence and number of ACF were significantly higher in SSA/P patients than in normal subjects. A significant correlation was seen between the numbers of SSA/P and ACF in SSA/P patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ACF are precursor lesions of the SSA/P-cancer sequence in patients with SSA/P, where ACF arise by B-RAF mutation and methylation of some of the six identified genes and develop into SSA/Ps through accumulated methylation of these genes.",4.836,1663

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and calcium supplementation counteract body weight gain, particularly under a high-fat (HF) diet, in adult mice. The aim was to determine whether the modulation of DNA methylation pattern in target genes and tissues could be an underlying mechanism of action. METHODS: Mice (C57BL/6J) were divided into five groups according to diet and treatment: normal fat as the control group (12 % kJ content as fat), HF group (43 % kJ content as fat), HF + CLA (6 mg CLA/day), HF + calcium (12 g/kg of calcium) and HF with both compounds. Gene expression and methylation degree of CpG sites in promoter sequences of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including adiponectin (Adipoq), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd1) and fatty acid synthase (Fasn), were determined by bisulphite sequencing in liver and epididymal white adipose tissue. RESULTS: Results showed that the methylation profile of promoters was significantly altered by dietary supplementation in a gene- and tissue-specific manner, whereas only slight changes were observed in the HF group. Furthermore, changes in specific CpG sites were also associated with an overall healthier metabolic profile, in particular for calcium-receiving groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both CLA and calcium were able to modify the methylation pattern of genes involved in energy balance in adulthood, which opens a novel area for increasing efficiency in body weight management strategies.",3.467,1900

In this study, we analyzed the methylation of HPV16 DNA. METHODS: The aims of this study were to determine the methylation status of the HPV16 L2 gene in DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells collected longitudinally as part of the CWCS and to determine the prevalence of polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) in folate metabolizing enzymes and DNA repair enzymes known to affect DNA methylation in blood-derived genomic DNA from CWCS participants. For methylation studies, DNA samples were bisulfite converted and amplified with the EpiTect Whole Bisulfitome kit. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for amplicons containing 5 CpG sites in L2. Pyrosequencing was carried out using EpigenDx and analyzed with PyroMark Software. Taqman genotyping assays were performed to determine selected SNP alleles in the CWCS cohort. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Methylation data were obtained for 82 samples from 27 participants. Of these, 22 participants were positive for HPV16 for 3 or more visits (>/=12 months). Methylation in L2 was detectable, but methylation levels varied and were not associated with HPV16 persistence. No linearity of methylation levels over time was observed in participants for whom longitudinal data could be analyzed. Analysis of 9 selected SNPs did not reveal an association with persistence. We conclude that at early stages of infection methylation of HPV16 L2 DNA in Pap test samples is not a predictive biomarker of HPV persistence.",1.994,799

Methylation of guanine at position 748 by the intrinsic methyltransferase RlmA(II) enhances binding of telithromycin (TEL) to A752 in Streptococcus pneumoniae. We have found that another intrinsic methylation of the adjacent uridine at position 747 enhances G748 methylation by RlmA(II), rendering TEL susceptibility. U747 and another nucleotide, U1939, were methylated by the dual-specific methyltransferase RlmCD encoded by SP_1029 in S. pneumoniae. Inactivation of RlmCD reduced N1-methylated level of G748 by RlmA(II) in vivo, leading to TEL resistance when the nucleotide A2058, located in domain V of 23S rRNA, was dimethylated by the dimethyltransferase Erm(B). In vitro methylation of rRNA showed that RlmA(II) activity was significantly enhanced by RlmCD-mediated pre-methylation of 23S rRNA. These results suggest that RlmCD-mediated U747 methylation promotes efficient G748 methylation by RlmA(II), thereby facilitating TEL binding to the ribosome.",9.112,17

Percent methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) is a biomarker of genome-wide methylation and is a potential biomarker for breast cancer.

In a cross-sectional study of 121 healthy women with no prior history of cancer who underwent reduction mammoplasty, we examined associations between plasma and breast folate, genetic variation in one-carbon metabolism, and percent LINE-1 methylation using multivariable regression models (adjusting for race, oral contraceptive use, and alcohol use). Results are expressed as the ratio of LINE-1 methylation relative to that of the referent group, with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We found no significant associations between plasma or breast folate and percent LINE-1 methylation. Variation in MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR were significantly associated with percent LINE-1 methylation. Variant allele carriers of MTHFR A1289C had 4% lower LINE-1 methylation (Ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.98), while variant allele carriers of MTR A2756G (Ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06) and MTRR A66G (Ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06) had 3% higher LINE-1 methylation, compared to those carrying the more common genotypes of these SNPs.

 States of America",2015,"Early-life adversity increases the risk for psychopathology in later life. The underlying mechanism(s) is unknown, but epigenetic variation represents a plausible candidate. Early-life exposures can disrupt epigenetic programming in the brain, with lasting consequences for gene expression and behavior. This evidence is primarily derived from animal studies, with limited study in humans due to inaccessibility of the target brain tissue. In humans, although there is evidence for DNA methylation changes in the peripheral blood of psychiatric patients, a fundamental question remains as to whether epigenetic markers in the blood can predict epigenetic changes occurring in the brain. We used in utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure as a model environmental exposure shown to disrupt neurodevelopment and exert long-term effects on behavior in animals and humans. We show that prenatal BPA induces lasting DNA methylation changes in the transcriptionally relevant region of the Bdnf gene in the hippocampus and blood of BALB/c mice and that these changes are consistent with BDNF changes in the cord blood of humans exposed to high maternal BPA levels in utero. Our data suggest that BDNF DNA methylation in the blood may be used as a predictor of brain BDNF DNA methylation and gene expression as well as behavioral vulnerability induced by early-life environmental exposure. Because BDNF expression and DNA methylation are altered in several psychiatric disorders that are associated with early-life adversity, including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism, BDNF DNA methylation in the blood may represent a novel biomarker for the early detection of psychopathology.",9.674,867

We previously demonstrated that DNA methylation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (5' LTR) restricts HIV-1 reactivation and, together with chromatin conformation, represents an important mechanism of HIV-1 latency maintenance. Here, we explored the new issue of temporal development of DNA methylation in latent HIV-1 5' LTR. RESULTS: In the Jurkat CD4(+) T cell model of latency, we showed that the stimulation of host cells contributed to de novo DNA methylation of the latent HIV-1 5' LTR sequences. Consecutive stimulations of model CD4(+) T cell line with TNF-alpha and PMA or with SAHA contributed to the progressive accumulation of 5' LTR DNA methylation. Further, we showed that once established, the high DNA methylation level of the latent 5' LTR in the cell line model was a stable epigenetic mark. Finally, we explored the development of 5' LTR DNA methylation in the latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals who were treated with ART. We detected low levels of 5' LTR DNA methylation in the resting CD4(+) T cells of the group of patients who were treated for up to 3 years. However, after long-term ART, we observed an accumulation of 5' LTR DNA methylation in the latent reservoir. Importantly, within the latent reservoir of some long-term-treated individuals, we uncovered populations of proviral molecules with a high density of 5' LTR CpG methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the presence of 5' LTR DNA methylation in the long-term reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals and implied that the transient stimulation of cells harboring latent proviruses may contribute, at least in part, to the methylation of the HIV-1 promoter.",4.543,80

METHODS: The CpG island methylation status of RASSF1A genes were analyzed in 100 cases of tumor specimens as well as their adjacent tissues which was used for methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The expression of DNMT1 protein was determined by immunohistochemistry. Difference between measurement data and categorical data was compared through analysis of t test and chi-square test. All the statistics were taken with a bilateral test. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The promoter methylation of the RASSF1A gene promoter has been detected in 45 out of 100 (45%) esophageal squamous carcinoma cases, while methylation of RASSF1A gene has been detected in 2 out of 100 adjacent normal tissues (2%). The RASSF1A gene promoter was highly methylated in cancer tissues, and there were significant differences between normal esophagus tissues and esophageal squamous carcinoma (P < 0.05). The expression of DNMT1 protein has been detected in 61 out of 100 (61%) esophageal squamous carcinoma cases, including 41 cases in the above 45 methylated samples of RASSF1A gene promoter, and none in adjacent tissues. DNMT1 proteins are highly expressed in cancer tissues, and there were significant differences (P < 0.05). In positive cases for methylation of RASSF1A, the DNMT1 protein had been detected in 41 out of 45 (91%), while in non-methylated cancer cases, 20 out of 55(36.3%), and the difference is significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal squamous carcinoma tumorigenesis may be related with hypermethylation of DNMT1 and RASSF1A promoter CpG island due to their high expression and also their hypermethylation.",1.408,1100

Biochemical characterization of the 25kDa recombinant protein by in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that SpOMT2884 was an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase. SpOMT2884 catalyzed O-methylation of different classes of flavonoids such as flavones (7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), luteolin), flavonols (quercetin, rutin), flavanone (naringenin), and isoflavonoids (daidzein, formononetin). Biotransformation of 7,8-DHF, a preferred substrate of SpOMT2884, in a grown-induced culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring the recombinant pET-28a-SpOMT2884 stoichiometrically converted 7,8-DHF into 7-hydroxy-8-methoxyflavone, which was confirmed by liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and various nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses. In order to improve the biotransformation substrate, time and media parameters were optimized and the production was scaled up using a 3-L fermentor. The maximum yield of 7-hydroxy-8-methoxyflavone was 192muM (52.57mg/L), representing almost 96% bioconversion within 12h, when 200muM of 7,8-DHF was supplemented in the culture. Further, the 7-hydroxy-8-methoxyflavone was purified in large scale and was used as a substrate separately for in vitro glycosylation to produce glucose, galactose and 2-deoxyglucose conjugated at 7th hydroxyl position of 7-hydroxy-8-methoxyflavone. Biological activity showed that 7-hydroxy-8-methoxyflavone had long term cytoprotective and antioxidant effects compared to 7,8-DHF suggesting that methylation enhances the stability of substrate and glycosylation has proved to increase the water solubility.",2.871,1844

Genetics,2014,"DNA methylation, which occurs at the 5'-position of the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, has great potential for forensic identification of body fluids, because tissue-specific patterns of DNA methylation have been demonstrated, and DNA is less prone to degradation than proteins or RNA. Previous studies have reported several body fluid-specific DNA methylation markers, but DNA methylation differences are sometimes low in saliva and vaginal secretions. Moreover, specific DNA methylation markers in four types of body fluids (blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions) have not been investigated with genome-wide profiling. Here, we investigated novel DNA methylation markers for identification of body fluids for use in forensic science using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450K bead array, which contains over 450,000 CpG sites. Using methylome data from 16 samples of blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions, we first selected 2986 hypermethylated or hypomethylated regions that were specific for each type of body fluid. We then selected eight CpG sites as novel, forensically relevant DNA methylation markers: cg06379435 and cg08792630 for blood, cg26107890 and cg20691722 for saliva, cg23521140 and cg17610929 for semen, and cg01774894 and cg14991487 for vaginal secretions. These eight selected markers were evaluated in 80 body fluid samples using pyrosequencing, and all showed high sensitivity and specificity for identification of the target body fluid. We suggest that these eight DNA methylation markers may be good candidates for developing an effective molecular assay for identification of body fluids in forensic science.",4.604,1079

 biology",2014,"Plant secondary walls are the major constituent of plant biomass targeted for second-generation biofuel production. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how secondary walls are constructed is critical for a better utilization of plant biomass for biofuel production. One of the major components in secondary walls is xylan, which is composed of a linear chain of beta-1,4-linked xylosyl residues. In Arabidopsis, about 10% of xylosyl residues in xylan are substituted with glucuronic acid (GlcA), of which 60% are methylated at O-4. By contrast, all of the GlcA substituents in Populus xylan are methylated at O-4. It is not known how the degree of GlcA methylation in xylan is controlled. In this report, we demonstrated that simultaneous T-DNA knockout mutations of the three glucuronoxylan methyltransferase (GXM) genes, GXM1, GXM2, and GXM3/GXMT1, which are specifically expressed in secondary wall-forming cells, led to a complete loss of GlcA methylation in xylan in Arabidopsis stems. Overexpression of GXM2 and GXM3 in wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in an up to 5-fold increase in glucuronoxylan methyltransferase activity and as a result, up to 90% of the GlcA side chains in xylan were methylated as opposed to 60% seen in the wild type. The increased degree of GlcA methylation in xylan had no discernable effects on cell wall sugar composition and lignin monomer composition. These results reveal that the activities of GXM1, GXM2 and GXM3 are responsible for all of the GlcA methylation in xylan in Arabidopsis stems and that the degree of GlcA methylation in xylan can be modified by altered expression of GXMs.",0,1611

So far, its prognostic relevance in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients has not been understood. METHODS: Methylation status of SOCS-1 gene was analyzed in series of 100 patients using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and correlated with disease severity, progression, and survival by comparing prognostic factors such as hematological, clinical, and cytogenetics. RESULTS: Of the total of 100 MDS patients analyzed, methylation of SOCS1 gene was found in 53% patients. Also, the frequency of patients with poor and intermediate cytogenetics was observed significantly high in methylated group (P < 0.001). Moreover, the patients with methylated SOCS-1 gene had significantly more frequent disease progression as compared to the patients with unmethylated SOCS-1 gene (P < 0.006). Both progression-free survival and median overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with methylated SOCS-1 gene when compared to the patients with unmethylated SOCS-1 gene (P = 0.006 & P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study for the first time showed that the mathylation of SOCS-1 gene plays an important role in the disease progression and is associated with poor survival especially among the high-risk patients. This may be due to high association between SOCS1 methylation and higher risk subtypes of MDS (such as RAEB) in this study.",1.819,1288

However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism has not well been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex steroid hormones on epigenetic DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer cells using a signature PCR methylation array panel that correspond to 96 genes with biological function in the human inflammatory and autoimmune signals in prostate cancer. Of the 96-gene panel, 32 genes showed at least 10% differentially methylation level in response to hormonal treatment when compared to untreated cells. Genes that were hypomethylated included CXCL12, CXCL5, CCL25, IL1F8, IL13RAI, STAT5A, CXCR4 and TLR5; and genes that were hypermethylated included ELA2, TOLLIP, LAG3, CD276 and MALT1. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of select genes represented in a cytokine expression array panel showed inverse association between DNA methylation and gene expression for TOLLIP, CXCL5, CCL18 and IL5 genes and treatment of prostate cancer cells with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine with or without trichostatin A induced up-regulation of TOLLIP expression. Further analysis of relative gene expression of matched prostate cancer tissues when compared to benign tissues from individual patients with prostate cancer showed increased and significant expression for CCL18 (2.6-fold; p<0.001), a modest yet significant increase in IL5 expression (1.17-fold; p=0.015), and a modest increase in CXCL5 expression (1.4-fold; p=0.25).

Those differences may underlie the region-specific characteristics of common colon epithelial diseases such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. DNA methylation is a cell-type specific epigenetic mark, essential for transcriptional regulation, silencing of repetitive DNA and genomic imprinting. Little is known about any region-specific variations in methylation patterns in human colon epithelial cells. Using purified epithelial cells and whole biopsies (n= 19) from human subjects, we generated epigenome-wide DNA methylation data (using the HELP-tagging assay), comparing the methylation signatures of the proximal and distal colon. We identified a total of 125 differentially methylated sites (DMS) mapping to transcription start sites of protein-coding genes, most notably several members of the homeobox (HOX) family of genes. Patterns of differential methylation were validated with MassArray EpiTYPER. We also examined DNA methylation in whole biopsies, applying a computational technique to deconvolve variation in methylation within cell types and variation in cell-type composition across biopsies. Including inferred epithelial proportions as a covariate in differential methylation analysis applied to the whole biopsies resulted in greater overlap with the results obtained from purified epithelial cells compared with when the covariate was not included. Results obtained from both approaches highlight region-specific methylation patterns of HOX genes in colonic epithelium. Regional variation in methylation patterns has implications for the study of diseases that exhibit regional expression patterns in the human colon, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.",2.374,853

In our previous study, we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis combined with gene re-expression analysis by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, to identify methylation genes in CRC genome widely. Among these genes, 12 genes showed aberrant hypermethylation frequently in >75% of 149 CRC samples but did not in normal samples. In this study, we aim to find out any of these methylation genes to be utilized for CRC detection using plasma DNA samples. Primers for methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing were designed for seven of the 12 genes. Among them, PPP1R3C and EFHD1 were rarely hypermethylated in peripheral blood cells, but frequently hypermethylated in 24 CRC tissue samples and their corresponding plasma samples. In plasma samples, PPP1R3C was methylated in 81% (97/120) of CRC patients, but only in 19% (18/96) of noncancer patients (P = 6 x 10(-20) , Fisher's exact test). In combined analysis with EFHD1, both genes were methylated in 53% (64/120) of CRC patients, but only in 4% (4/96) of noncancer patients (P = 2 x 10(-16) ), giving high specificity of 96%. At least one of the two genes was methylated in 90% (108/120) of CRC patients, and 36% (35/96) of control patients, giving high sensitivity of 90%. Compared with low sensitivity of carcinoembryonic antigen (17% at stage I, 40% at stage II) and CA19-9 (0% at stage I, 13% at stage II) for early-stage CRCs, sensitivity of aberrant methylation was significantly higher: PPP1R3C methylation at 92% (11/12) for stage I and 77% (23/30) for stage II, and methylation of at least one gene at 100% (12/12) for stage I and 87% (26/30) for stage II. PPP1R3C methylation or its combined use of EFHD1 methylation was highly positive in CRC plasma samples, and they might be useful in detection of CRC, especially for early-stage CRCs.",2.5,1340

STUDY FINDING: We identified two independent phenomena that lead to aberrant XCI patterns in female hPSC: a rapid loss of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and long non-coding X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) expression during culture, often accompanied by erosion of XCI-specific methylation, and a frequent loss of random XCI in the cultures. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Variable XCI patterns have been reported in female hPSC, not only between different hPSC lines, but also between sub-passages of the same cell line, however the reasons for this variability remain unknown. Moreover, while non-random XCI-linked DNA methylation patterns have been previously reported, their origin and extent have not been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: We investigated the XCI patterns in 23 human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines, during long-term culture and after differentiation, by gene expression analysis, histone modification assessment and study of DNA methylation. The presence and location of H3K27me3 was studied by immunofluorescence, XIST expression by real-time PCR, and mono- or bi-allelic expression of X-linked genes was studied by sequencing of cDNA. XCI-specific DNA methylation was analysed using methylation-sensitive restriction and PCR, and more in depth by massive parallel bisulphite sequencing. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All hPSC lines showed XCI, but we found a rapid loss of XCI marks during the early stages of in vitro culture. While this loss of XCI marks was accompanied in several cases by an extensive erosion of XCI-specific methylation, it did not result in X chromosome reactivation. Moreover, lines without strong erosion of methylation frequently displayed non-random DNA methylation, which occurred independently from the loss of XCI marks. This bias in X chromosome DNA methylation did not appear as a passenger event driven by clonal culture take-over of chromosome abnormalities and was independent of the parental origin of the X chromosome. Therefore, we suggest that a culture advantage conferred by alleles on the X chromosome or by XCI-related mechanisms may be at the basis of this phenomenon. Finally, differentiated populations inherited the aberrant XCI patterns from the undifferentiated cells they were derived from. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: All hPSC lines in this study were cultured in highly similar conditions. Our results may therefore be specific for these conditions and alternative culture conditions might lead to different findings. Our findings are only a first step towards elucidating the molecular events leading to the phenomena we observed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results highlight the significant extent of aberrant XCI in female hPSC. The fact that these aberrations are inherited by the differentiated progeny may have a significant impact on downstream research and clinical uses of hPSC. In order to achieve the full potential of hPSC, more insight into the XCI status and its stability in hPSC and its effect on the properties of the differentiated progeny is needed.

Airborne benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) levels in workplace and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OH-Py) levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. DNA damage of PBMCs and the p14(ARK), p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) gene CpG island methylation in the promoter region were detected by comet assay and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction techniques, respectively. Results show that compared with the controls, concentration of airborne B[a]Ps was elevated in the coke plant, and urinary 1-OH-Py's level and DNA olive tail moment in comet assay were significantly increased in the coke oven workers, and p14(ARK), p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a) gene methylation rates were also significantly increased. With the working years and urinary 1-OH-Py's level, the rates of p14(ARK) and p16(INK4a) gene methylation were significantly increased while that of p15(INK4b) gene methylation displayed no statistical change.

Noncandidate-based methylome-wide studies leveraging multiple tissue types are needed in order to identify a set of CpG targets that reliably differentiate AUD patients from controls and strongly correlate across brain tissue and more commonly collected tissue types (e.g., buccal cells). METHODS: Postmortem precuneus brain tissue samples were collected from 49 alcohol-dependent (AD) cases and 47 controls (sample I), and DNA was extracted from precuneus and putamen brain tissue and buccal cells in 24 postmortem subjects (sample II). Methylation levels were analyzed at over 450,000 CpG sites in both samples. CpGs that demonstrated significant methylation differences between cases and controls were advanced for further analysis with the goal of identifying CpGs that also demonstrated consistent methylation correlations across tissue type. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, 244 hypomethylated and 188 hypermethylated CpGs met a priori criteria for both significant methylation differences between cases and controls as well as significant correlation across brain and buccal cell tissue types, employing stringent Bonferroni p-value correction. Many of these CpGs were involved in gene networks related to lipid metabolism, immune response, inflammatory response/disease, and gastro-intestinal disease. CONCLUSIONS: More than 400 CpGs demonstrated differences in methylation between AD cases and controls and showed significant correlation across tissue types.

Aberrant Wnt pathway regulation can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and cancer, and loss of Wnt7a expression has been demonstrated in lung cancer cell lines. E-cadherin keeps intercellular integrity and prevents metastasis. Therefore, E-cadherin has been known as a prognostic factor in cancer. In the present study, we investigated the E-cadherin expression status by immunohistochemical stain and the Wnt7a promoter methylation status in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) by methylation-specific PCR. We also analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological factors. Methylation of the Wnt7a gene promoter was detected in the lung tissues of 32 of 121 (26.4%) patients with NSCLC. Wnt7a promoter methylation was correlated with advanced tumor stage (P = 0.036) and distant metastasis (P = 0.037). In addition, Wnt7a promoter methylation showed correlation with loss of E-cadherin expression (P < 0.001). However, Wnt7a promoter methylation was not closely related with gender, age, histological type, or smoking habit. Even though Wnt7a methylation could not show significant correlation with the long term survival of the patients with limited follow up data, these findings suggest that loss of the Wnt7a gene induced by promoter methylation might be another prognostic factor for NSCLC and that restoration of Wnt7a may be a promising treatment for NSCLC.",1.266,1016

Emerging evidence reveals that ethanol administration disrupts the intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) complex; this defect allows for the paracellular translocation of gut-derived pathogenic molecules to reach the liver to cause inflammation and progressive liver injury. We have previously demonstrated a causative role of impairments in liver transmethylation reactions in the pathogenesis of ALD. We have further shown that treatment with betaine, a methylation agent that normalizes liver methylation potential, can attenuate ethanol-induced liver injury. Herein, we explored whether alterations in methylation reactions play a causative role in disrupting intestinal mucosal barrier function by employing an intestinal epithelial cell line. Monolayers of Caco-2 cells were exposed to ethanol or a-pan methylation reaction inhibitor, tubercidin, in the presence and absence of betaine. The structural and functional integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier was then examined. We observed that exposure to either ethanol or tubercidin disrupted TJ integrity and function by decreasing the localization of TJ protein occludin-1 to the intracellular junctions, reducing transepithelial electrical resistance and increasing dextran influx. All these detrimental effects of ethanol and tubercidin were attenuated by co-treatment with betaine. We further show that the mechanism of betaine protection was through BHMT-mediated catalysis. Collectively, our data suggest a novel mechanism for alcohol-induced gut leakiness and identifies the importance of normal methylation reactions in maintaining TJ integrity. We also propose betaine as a potential therapeutic option for leaky gut in alcohol-consuming patients who are at the risk of developing ALD.",5.009,32

We examined relationships between low-to-moderate occupational exposure to particles from welding fumes and cancer-related biomarkers for oxidative stress, changes in telomere length, and alterations in DNA methylation. We enrolled 101 welders and 127 controls (all currently nonsmoking men) from southern Sweden. We performed personal sampling of respirable dust and measured 8-oxodG concentrations in urine using a simplified liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Telomere length in peripheral blood was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Methylation status of 10 tumor suppressor genes was determined by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting analysis. All analyses were adjusted for age, body mass index, previous smoking, passive smoking, current residence, and wood burning stove/boiler at home. Welders were exposed to respirable dust at 1.2 mg/m(3) (standard deviation, 3.3 mg/m(3); range, 0.1-19.3), whereas control exposures did not exceed 0.1 mg/m(3) (P < 0.001). Welders and controls did not differ in 8-oxodG levels (beta = 1.2, P = 0.17) or relative telomere length (beta = -0.053, P = 0.083) in adjusted models. Welders showed higher probability of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) methylation in the unadjusted model (odds ratio = 14, P = 0.014), but this was not significant in the fully adjusted model (P = 0.052). Every working year as a welder was associated with 0.0066 units shorter telomeres (95% confidence interval -0.013 to -0.00053, P = 0.033).

Standard curve analysis using control DNA samples demonstrated the highest quantitative accuracy in Q-MSP analysis. We also carried out methylation analysis using gastric mucosa specimens obtained from gastric cancer patients. We found a high correlation between methylation levels determined by Q-MSP and those determined by MethyLight (R(2)=0.952), whereas the results of bisulfite pyrosequencing and the other two methods were less well correlated (R(2)=0.864 and R(2)=0.804 for Q-MSP and MethyLight, respectively). This may reflect possible PCR bias in the pyrosequencing technique, which we show can be corrected for by applying a cubic approximate equation to the original data.

The function of H3K4me in phytopathogenic fungi remains unclear. Here, we report that FgSet1 is predominantly responsible for mono-, di- and trimethylation of H3K4 in Fusarium graminearum. The FgSET1 deletion mutant (DeltaFgSet1) was crippled in hyphal growth and virulence. H3K4me is required for the active transcription of genes involved in deoxynivalenol and aurofusarin biosyntheses. Unexpectedly, FgSet1 plays an important role in the response of F. graminearum to cell wall-damaging agents via negatively regulating phosphorylation of FgMgv1, a core kinase in the cell wall integrity pathway. In addition, DeltaFgSet1 exhibited increased resistance to the transcription elongation inhibitor mycophenolic acid. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that FgSet1 physically interacts with multiple proteins including FgBre2, FgSpp1 and FgSwd2. FgBre2 further interacts with FgSdc1. Western blotting analyses showed that FgBre2 and FgSdc1 are associated with H3K4me. Both proteins are also involved in regulating deoxynivalenol biosynthesis and in responses to mycophenolic acid and cell wall-damaging agents. Taken together, these data indicate that H3K4me plays critical roles not only in regulation of fungal growth and secondary metabolism but also in multiple stress responses in F. graminearum.",6.201,1397

Determining the methylation status of genes in cancer and their association with clinical features play an essential role in early diagnosis, prognosis and determine appropriate treatment for patients. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the methylation of tumor suppressor genes in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Furthermore, we evaluated the association between clinical parameters and DNA methylation as a biomarker in diagnostic IDC patients. The methylation-specific multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay was used to analyze the methylation profile of 24 genes in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 75 patients with IDC. Each of the patients showed a distinctive methylation profile. We observed higher methylation in the RASSF1 (48 %), CDH13 (44 %) and GSTP1 (36 %) genes. Some of the methylated genes were associated with clinical features. Methylation of GSTP1 (P=0.028) and RASSF1 (P=0.012) were related with lymph node metastasis. Methylation of GSTP1 (P=0.005) was associated with high histological grade. Moreover, concurrent methylation of GSTP1 and CDH13 was observed in IDC patients (p<0.001). Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the methylation profile revealed two main clusters of patients, the highly methylated cluster being significantly associated with high histological grade and lymph node metastasis. The results of this study indicate that the methylation status of RASSF1 and CDH13 and GSTP1 can be a prognostic marker to better management of IDC patients.",0.857,1304

Loss of E-cadherin expression can lead to loss of tissue integrity, metastasis, and cancer progression. Also loss of E-cadherin expression might be related to aberrant promoter methylation of the CDH1 gene. Many studies have been performed on CDH1 promoter methylation, especially in breast cancer. Although most of the studies have used qualitative methods for methylation analysis, this study is designed to quantitatively investigate CDH1 promoter methylation in breast cancer and its correlation with patients' clinicopathological features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using differential high resolution melting analysis (D-HRMA), the methylation level of the CDH1 gene promoter was quantified in 98 breast cancer formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and also 10 fresh frozen normal breast tissues. RESULTS: All samples were detected to be methylated at the CDH1 promoter region. About 74.5% of the breast cancer samples were hypermethylated with an average methylation level of around 60%, while 25.5% of the patients were methylated with the mean methylation level of about 33%, and 90% of the normal samples had a mean methylation level of about 18%. Statistical analyses represented a significant correlation between CDH1 promoter methylation and cancer progression hallmarks, such as, clinical stage, nodal involvement, tumor size, and histological grade. CONCLUSION: In summary, quantitation of CDH1 promoter methylation can serve as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in breast cancer. Also D-HRMA can be used as a fast and reliable method for quantitation of promoter methylation.",0,1248

Despite high cure rates, refractory disease results in poor prognosis. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs during the development of seminomas and non-seminomas. Understanding the molecular and genetic basis of these tumors would represent an important advance in the search for new TGCT molecular markers. Hence the frequency of methylation of a gene panel (VGF, MGMT, ADAMTS1, CALCA, HOXA9, CDKN2B, CDO1 and NANOG) was evaluated in 72 primary TGCT by quantitative methylation specific PCR. A high frequency of MGMT (90.9%, 20/22; p=0.019) and CALCA (90.5%, 19/21; p<0.026) methylation was associated with non-seminomatous tumors while CALCA methylation was also associated with refractory disease (47.4%, 09/19; p=0.005). Moreover, promoter methylation of both genes predicts poor clinical outcome for TGCT patients (5-year EFS: 50.5% vs 77.1%; p=0.032 for MGMT and 51.3% vs 77.0%; p=0.029 for CALCA). The findings of this study indicate that methylation of MGMT and CALCA are frequent and could be used as new molecular markers of prognosis in TGCT.",6.359,755

Breast cancer specific deregulation of DNA methylation (both hyper- and hypomethylation) was found in twenty genes including ACVR1, OGG1, IL8 and TFF1. The methylation level in the promoter regions was significantly negatively correlated to gene expression for twelve genes (such as MST1R, ST6GAL1 and TFF1) indicating that a gain of aberrant methylation (hypermethylation) inhibits gene expression. Multiple associations between molecular and clinical parameters were identified, and multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that methylation was more strongly associated to clinical parameters than gene expression for the investigated genes. The methylation level of BCAP31 and OGG1 showed significant association to survival, and these associations were validated in a larger patient cohort (The Cancer Genome Atlas).

Such a molecular feat must be mediated by a stable, self-perpetuating, cellular information storage mechanism. DNA methylation, being the archetypal cellular information storage mechanism, has been heavily implicated as being necessary for stable activity-dependent transcriptional alterations within the CNS. This review details the foundational discoveries from both gene-targeted and whole-genome sequencing studies that have brought DNA methylation to our attention as a chief regulator of activity- and experience-dependent transcriptional alterations within the CNS. We present a hypothetical framework to resolve disparate experimental findings regarding distinct manipulations of DNA methylation and their effect on memory, taking into account the unique impact activity-dependent alterations in DNA methylation potentially have on both memory-promoting and memory-suppressing gene expression.

The expression of hormone receptors is significant in breast cancer because they are indicators of cancer cell growth rate and determine response to endocrine therapies. We investigated the frequency of aberrant events and variation in DNA methylation at nine imprinted sites in invasive breast cancer and examined the association with estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Breast tissue and blood from patients with invasive breast cancer (n = 38) and benign breast disease (n = 30) were compared with those from healthy individuals (n = 36), matched with the cancer patients by age at diagnosis, ethnicity, body mass index, menopausal status and familial history of cancer. DNA methylation and allele-specific expression were analyzed by pyrosequencing.

Variation in methylation was significantly greater in breast tissue from cancer patients compared with that in healthy individuals and benign breast disease. Aberrant methylation of three or more sites was significantly associated with negative estrogen-alpha (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.02) and progesterone-A (p = 0.02) receptor status.

Altered WNT5A expression is associated with various cancers, although in most studies the focus has been on only one of the known WNT5A isoforms. In this study, we analyzed expression from two of the major WNT5A promoters, termed promoter A and promoter B, in normal human osteoblasts, SaOS-2 and U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines, and osteosarcoma tumor tissue. We found that both promoters A and B are active in normal osteoblasts with nearly 11-fold more promoter B than A transcripts. Promoter B but not promoter A transcripts are decreased or nearly undetectable in the SaOS-2 and U2OS cell lines and osteosarcoma tumor tissues. Transient transfection of promoter A and promoter B reporter constructs confirmed that SaOS-2 cells have the necessary factors to transcribe both promoters. Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that three CpG enriched regions upstream of the promoter B exon 1betaare highly methylated in both SaOS-2 and U2OS cells. The CpG island sub-region R6 located in promoter B exon 1beta was approximately 51% methylated in SaOS-2 and 25% methylated in U2OS. Region 3 was approximately 28% methylated in normal osteoblasts, whereas the others were unmethylated. Promoter B was re-activated by treatment of SaOS-2 cells with 1 muM 5-azacytidine, which was associated with only a small insignificant change in methylation of sub-region R6. ChIP analysis of U2OS and SaOS-2 cells indicated that the promoter B region is less enriched in the active histone mark H3K4me3, in comparison to promoter A and that there is increased enrichment of the repressive mark H3K27me3 in association with the promoter B genomic region in the cell line SaOS-2. These findings show that epigenetic inactivation of the WNT5A promoter B involves both DNA methylation and histone modifications and suggest that differential expression of the WNT5A alternative promoters A and B is a characteristic of osteosarcomas.",3.234,201

Nevertheless, the underlying antiviral transcription mechanism of LGP2 remains obscure. The present study attempted to reveal the methylation levels of CiLGP2 (Ctenopharyngodon idella LGP2) in muscle and spleen of grass carp and their association with the resistance against grass carp reovirus (GCRV). By prediction, the CpG island was 133 bp in length in 5'-flanking region, containing six candidate CpG loci, whose methylation statuses were investigated by virtue of the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) among muscle and spleen tissues in 120 individuals that were divided into resistant/susceptible groups after a challenge experiment, and the association analysis was performed with Chi-square test. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to ascertain the interrelation between methylation status and transcription of CiLGP2. The CpG sites at -1394, -1366, -1331 and -1314 nt were identified as hypermethylated, inversely unmethylated at -1350 CpG site. The -1411 CpG site presented six methylation patterns as well as one mentionable type of mutation triggered by spontaneous deamination. Although there was no statistically significant difference on DNA methylation with resistance against GCRV at -1411 CpG site, the methylation levels were significantly lower in spleen than those in muscle, accompanied by higher mRNA expression of CiLGP2 in spleen. Notably, DNA methylation may be conceivably serve as an essential regulatory factor for CiLGP2 antiviral transcription in spleen. This research first demonstrated the relationship between DNA methylation and LGP2 gene expression, preliminary revealed the underlying transcription mechanism of CiLGP2 against GCRV as well as provided potential references and laid a theoretical foundation for viral recognition and regulation research of LGP2 in vertebrates.",2.674,1485

In this study, we examine the whole genome methylation profiles of three stages of the haploid honey bee genome: unfertilised eggs, the adult drones that develop from these eggs and the sperm produced by these drones. These methylomes reveal distinct patterns of methylation. Eggs and sperm show 381 genes with significantly different CpG methylation patterns, with the vast majority being more methylated in eggs. Adult drones show greatly reduced levels of methylation across the genome when compared with both gamete samples. This suggests a dynamic cycle of methylation loss and gain through the development of the drone and during spermatogenesis. Although fluxes in methylation during embryogenesis may account for some of the differentially methylated sites, the distinct methylation patterns at some genes suggest parent-specific epigenetic marking in the gametes. Extensive germ line methylation of some genes possibly explains the lower-than-expected frequency of CpG sites in these genes.

During aging, de novo mutations accumulate in the male germline and are frequently transmitted to the offspring with deleterious effects. In addition, DNA methylation during spermatogenesis is an active process, which is susceptible to errors that can be propagated to subsequent generations. Here we test the hypothesis that the integrity of germline DNA methylation is compromised during the aging process. A genome-wide DNA methylation screen comparing sperm from young and old mice revealed a significant loss of methylation in the older mice in regions associated with transcriptional regulation. The offspring of older fathers had reduced exploratory and startle behaviors and exhibited similar brain DNA methylation abnormalities as observed in the paternal sperm. Offspring from old fathers also had transcriptional dysregulation of developmental genes implicated in autism and schizophrenia. Our findings demonstrate that DNA methylation abnormalities arising in the sperm of old fathers are a plausible mechanism to explain some of the risks that APA poses to resulting offspring.",14.496,598

Important ontological and pathological transitions are associated with marked global changes in detectable levels of methylation. We have previously found two pools of immune-detectable 5 meC exist within cells, a pool that can be detected after acid treatment of fixed cells to denature chromatin and another large but variable pool that requires a further tryptic digestion step for complete epitope retrieval. The trypsin-sensitive pool has been shown to be largely associated with the heterochromatic fraction (by a heterochromatin marker, HP1-beta) of the genome, and the size of this pool varies with the growth disposition of cells. Since DNA damage imposes large changes on chromatin structure the present study analyzed how such changes influences the faithful immunological detection of 5 meC within mouse embryonic fibroblasts. DNA damage was induced by either UV-irradiation or doxorubicin treatment, each of which resulted in increased levels of immune-detectable 5 meC at 24-48 h after treatment. There was a marked trypsin-sensitive pool of 5 meC in these cells which was significantly increased after DNA damage. The increased levels of 5 meC staining predominantly co-located with heterochromatic foci within nuclei, as assessed by HP1-beta staining. The relative amount of masked 5 meC after DNA damage was positively associated with increased levels of HP1-beta. The methyl binding protein, MBD1, was a less reliable measure of changes in 5 meC, with a significant fraction of 5 meC not being marked by MBD1. The cyto-epigenetic approaches used here reveal dynamism in the levels and localization of immune-detectable 5 meC within the nuclei of fibroblasts in response to DNA damage.",3.246,1623

Histone methyltransferases or demethylases actively add or remove various methylation marks in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent way. They are therefore important players in regulating the transcriptional program of a cell. Some control of the various cellular programs is necessary during the differentiation of stem cells along a specific lineage, when differentiation to alternative lineages needs to be suppressed. One example is the development of neurons from neural stem cells during neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is a highly organized process that requires the proper coordination of survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration signals. This holds true for both embryonic and neural stem cells that give rise to the various cell types of the central nervous system. The control of embryonic and neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is achieved by both extrinsic and intrinsic signals that regulate gene expression precisely. Recent advances in neuroscience support the importance of epigenetic modifications, such as the methylation and acetylation of histones, as an important intrinsic mechanism for the regulation of central nervous system development. This review summarizes our current knowledge of histone methylation processes during neural development and provides insights into the function of histone methylation enzymes and their role during central nervous system development.",3.565,1276

Spatial transcriptome profiling of endothelium in pre-lesional arteries has demonstrated differential phenotypes primed for athero-susceptibility at hemodynamic sites associated with disturbed blood flow. DNA methylation is a powerful epigenetic regulator of endothelial transcription recently associated with flow characteristics. We investigated differential DNA methylation in flow region-specific aortic endothelial cells in vivo in adult domestic male and female swine. RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled in endothelial cells (EC) isolated from two robust locations of differing patho-susceptibility:--an athero-susceptible site located at the inner curvature of the aortic arch (AA) and an athero-protected region in the descending thoracic (DT) aorta. Complete methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) identified over 5500 endothelial differentially methylated regions (DMRs). DMR density was significantly enriched in exons and 5'UTR sequences of annotated genes, 60 of which are linked to cardiovascular disease. The set of DMR-associated genes was enriched in transcriptional regulation, pattern specification HOX loci, oxidative stress and the ER stress adaptive pathway, all categories linked to athero-susceptible endothelium. Examination of the relationship between DMR and mRNA in HOXA genes demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between CpG island promoter methylation and gene expression. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) confirmed differential CpG methylation of HOXA genes, the ER stress gene ATF4, inflammatory regulator microRNA-10a and ARHGAP25 that encodes a negative regulator of Rho GTPases involved in cytoskeleton remodeling. Gender-specific DMRs associated with ciliogenesis that may be linked to defects in cilia development were also identified in AA DMRs. CONCLUSIONS: An endothelial methylome analysis identifies epigenetic DMR characteristics associated with transcriptional regulation in regions of atherosusceptibility in swine aorta in vivo.

We previously reported that cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-specific DNA methylation in transgenic gentian (Gentiana triflora x G. scabra) plants occurs irrespective of the copy number and the genomic location of T-DNA, and causes strong gene silencing. To confirm whether 35S-specific methylation can occur in other plant species, transgenic lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) plants with a single copy of the 35S promoter-driven sGFP gene were produced and analyzed. Among 10 lines of transgenic plants, 3, 4, and 3 lines showed strong, weak, and no expression of sGFP mRNA, respectively. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the 35S promoter region showed hypermethylation at CpG and CpWpG (where W is A or T) sites in 9 of 10 lines. Gentian-type de novo methylation pattern, consisting of methylated cytosines at CpHpH (where H is A, C, or T) sites, was also observed in the transgenic lettuce lines, suggesting that lettuce and gentian share similar methylation machinery. Four of five transgenic lettuce lines having a single copy of a modified 35S promoter, which was modified in the proposed core target of de novo methylation in gentian, exhibited 35S hypomethylation, indicating that the modified sequence may be the target of the 35S-specific methylation machinery.",3.071,1271

Cells have developed mechanisms to remove or recycle histones, generating a landscape of differentially aged nucleosomes. This study aimed to create a high-resolution, genome-wide map of nucleosome turnover in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) method was used to study replication-independent nucleosome turnover through the appearance of new histone H3 and the disappearance or preservation of old histone H3. The genome-wide location of histones was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease methodology (ChIP-exo). The findings were compared with diverse chromatin marks, including histone variant H2A.Z, post-translational histone modifications, and Pol II binding. Finally, genome-wide mapping of the methylation states of H4K20 was performed to determine the relationship between methylation (mono, di, and tri) of this residue and nucleosome turnover. Our analysis showed that histone recycling resulted in low nucleosome turnover in the coding regions of active genes, stably expressed at intermediate levels. High levels of transcription resulted in the incorporation of new histones primarily at the end of transcribed units. H4K20 was methylated in low-turnover nucleosomes in euchromatic regions, notably in the coding regions of long genes that were expressed at low levels. This transcription-dependent accumulation of histone methylation was dependent on the histone chaperone complex FACT. Our data showed that nucleosome turnover is highly dynamic in the genome and that several mechanisms are at play to either maintain or suppress stability. In particular, we found that FACT-associated transcription conserves histones by recycling them and is required for progressive H4K20 methylation.",14.63,308

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether methylation of the promoter regions of cell cycle regulators as well as elevated alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) levels are useful prognostic factors for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nested methylation-specific PCR (nested-MSP) was used to analyze methylation status of the promoter regions of p15, p16, p21, p27, and ras-association domain family 1 (RASSF1A) genes in tumor specimens from 50 patients with HCC. RESULTS: Promoter methylation was most common in the RASSF1A gene (96%), followed by the p16 gene (56%), the p21 gene (44%), the p15 gene (28%), and the p27 gene (2%). Patients with a serum AFP level < 400 ng/mL and an unmethylated p21 promoter had a better prognosis than patients with a serum AFP level >/= 400 ng/mL and a methylated p21 promoter (overall survival, p = 0.076; disease-free survival, p = 0.016). In addition, patients with full methylation of the promoter region of RASSF1A had a better prognosis than patients with a partially methylated or unmethylated RASSF1A promoter region if their serum AFP level was >/= 400 ng/mL (overall survival, p = 0.028; disease-free survival, p = 0.078).

Exposure to phthalates during critical periods in utero has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes but the biological mechanisms linking these exposures with disease are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the relationship of in utero phthalate exposure with repetitive element DNA methylation, an epigenetic marker of genome instability, in children from the longitudinal birth cohort CHAMACOS. Methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) was determined using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from whole blood samples collected from newborns and 9 year old children (n=355). Concentrations of eleven phthalate metabolites were measured in urine collected from pregnant mothers at 13 and 26 weeks gestation. We found a consistent inverse association between prenatal concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, the most frequently detected urinary metabolite, with cord blood methylation of Alu repeats (beta(95%CI): -0.14 (-0.28,0.00) and -0.16 (-0.31, -0.02)) for early and late pregnancy, respectively, and a similar but weaker association with LINE-1 methylation. Additionally, increases in urinary concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites during late pregnancy were associated with lower levels of methylation of Alu repeats in 9 year old blood (significant p-values ranged from 0.003 to 0.03).

However, the etiology and immunopathogenesis of KD are still unclear. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified polymorphisms in CD40, BLK, and FCGR2A as the susceptibility genes for KD. No epigenetic array studies of KD have previously been published. This study was undertaken to investigate differences in DNA methylation in patients with KD as compared to controls. METHODS: The HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (Illumina) was used to survey the differences in DNA methylation between KD patients and controls. DNA methylation array validation was performed in a separate cohort by pyrosequencing assay and reporter gene assays. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined, and the association of methylation with response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment was analyzed. RESULTS: HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay showed a 15% difference in methylation of 10 genes between KD patients and controls. The FCGR2A cg24422489 group, which was recently reported to be associated with KD susceptibility in a GWAS, had significant hypomethylation of 15.54% less in the KD group than in the control group. Validation of FCGR2A methylation in another cohort also showed significant hypomethylation in the KD group (5 of 5 CpG sites [P < 0.01]; n = 43 in the KD group and n = 55 in the control group). KD patients with IVIG resistance showed hypomethylation of 5 CpG sites (P < 0.05). FCGR2A mRNA expression was significantly increased in patients in the acute stage of KD compared to controls. Reporter gene assays indicated that the CpG sites of the FCGR2A promoter region were sufficient to modulate gene expression. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the DNA methylation array in KD and identify a role of hypomethylation of FCGR2A in susceptibility to KD and IVIG resistance.",0,919

In this study, we evaluated whether methylation of the promoter region of the BRCA1 gene detectable in DNA from peripheral blood cells is a risk factor for breast cancer, in particular for tumors with pathologic features characteristic for cancers with BRCA1 gene mutations. We conducted a case-control study of 66 breast cancer cases and 36 unaffected controls. Cases were triple-negative or of medullary histology, or both; 30 carried a constitutional BRCA1 mutation and 36 did not carry a mutation. Blood for DNA methylation analysis was taken within three months of diagnosis. Methylation of the promoter of the BRCA1 gene was measured in cases and controls using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM). A sample with any detectable level of methylation was considered to be positive. Methylation of the BRCA1 promoter was detected in 15 of 66 cases and in 2 of 36 controls (OR 5.0, p = 0.03). Methylation was present in 15 of 36 women with breast cancer and without germline BRCA1 mutation, but in none of 30 women with breast cancer and a germline mutation (p < 0.01). The association between methylation and breast cancer was restricted to women with no constitutional BRCA1 mutation (OR 12.1, p = 0.0006). Methylation of the promoter of the BRCA1 gene detectable in peripheral blood DNA may be a marker of increased susceptibility to triple-negative or medullary breast cancer.",3.94,1378

However, little is known about DNA methylation in invertebrates and its evolution. Here, we characterize two types of genomic DNA methylation in ctenophores, 5-methyl cytosine (5-mC) and the unconventional form of methylation 6-methyl adenine (6-mA). Using both bisulfite sequencing and an ELISA-based colorimetric assay, we experimentally confirmed the presence of 5-mC DNA methylation in ctenophores. In contrast to other invertebrates studied, Mnemiopsis leidyi has lower levels of genome-wide 5-mC methylation, but higher levels of 5-mC methylation in promoters when compared with gene bodies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ctenophores have distinct forms of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1); the zf-CXXC domain type, which localized DNMT1 to CpG sites, and is a metazoan specific innovation. We also show that ctenophores encode the full repertoire of putative enzymes for 6-mA DNA methylation, and these genes are expressed in the aboral organ of Mnemiopsis. Using an ELISA-based colorimetric assay, we experimentally confirmed the presence of 6-mA methylation in the genomes of three different species of ctenophores, M. leidyi, Beroe abyssicola, and Pleurobrachia bachei. The functional role of this novel epigenomic mark is currently unknown. In summary, despite their compact genomes, there is a wide variety of epigenomic mechanisms employed by basal metazoans that provide novel insights into the evolutionary origins of biological novelties.",2.929,1882

However, these findings have been inconsistent and plagued by spurious associations due to the cross reactivity of CpG probes on commercial microarrays. We collectively analysed 76 published studies (n = 6,795) for sex-associated differences in both autosomal and sex chromosome CpG sites. RESULTS: Overall autosomal methylation profiles varied substantially by study, and we encountered substantial batch effects. We accounted for these by conducting random effects meta-analysis for individual autosomal CpG methylation associations. After excluding non-specific probes, we found 184 autosomal CpG sites differentially methylated by sex after correction for multiple testing. In line with previous studies, average beta differences were small. Many of the most significantly associated CpG probes were new. Of note was differential CpG methylation in the promoters of genes thought to be involved in spermatogenesis and male fertility, such as SLC9A2, SPESP1, CRISP2, and NUPL1. Pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of genes differentially methylated by sex in several broad Gene Ontology biological processes, including RNA splicing and DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a comprehensive analysis of sex-specific methylation patterns. We demonstrate the existence of sex-specific methylation profiles and report a large number of novel DNA methylation differences in autosomal CpG sites between sexes.",3.986,1534

SOX11 is strongly up-regulated in some malignancies and have a functional role in tumorgenesis. With the aim to explore differences in epigenetic regulation of SOX11 expression in normal versus neoplastic cells, we investigated methylation and histone modifications related to the SOX11 promoter and the possibility to induce re-expression using histone deacetylase (HDAC) or EZH2 inhibitors. METHODS: The epigenetic regulation of SOX11 was investigated in distinct non-malignant cell populations (n = 7) and neoplastic cell-lines (n = 42) of different cellular origins. DNA methylation was assessed using bisulfite sequencing, methylation-specific melting curve analysis, MethyLight and pyrosequencing. The presence of H3K27me3 was assessed using ChIP-qPCR. The HDAC inhibitors Vorinostat and trichostatin A were used to induce SOX11 in cell lines with no endogenous expression. RESULTS: The SOX11 promoter shows a low degree of methylation and strong enrichment of H3K27me3 in non-malignant differentiated cells, independent of cellular origin. Cancers of the B-cell lineage are strongly marked by de novo methylation at the SOX11 promoter in SOX11 non-expressing cells, while solid cancer entities display a more varying degree of SOX11 promoter methylation. The silencing mark H3K27me3 was generally present at the SOX11 promoter in non-expressing cells, and an increased enrichment was observed in cancer cells with a low degree of SOX11 methylation compared to cells with dense methylation. Finally, we demonstrate that the HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat and trichostatin A) induce SOX11 expression in cancer cells with low levels of SOX11 methylation. CONCLUSIONS: We show that SOX11 is strongly marked by repressive histone marks in non-malignant cells. In contrast, SOX11 regulation in neoplastic tissues is more complex involving both DNA methylation and histone modifications. The possibility to re-express SOX11 in non-methylated tissue is of clinical relevance, and was successfully achieved in cell lines with low levels of SOX11 methylation. In breast cancer patients, methylation of the SOX11 promoter was shown to correlate with estrogen receptor status, suggesting that SOX11 may be functionally re-expressed during treatment with HDAC inhibitors in specific patient subgroups.",3.362,732
25319759,Evolving insights on how cytosine methylation affects protein-DNA binding.,[],Briefings in functional genomics,2015,"Many anecdotal observations exist of a regulatory effect of DNA methylation on gene expression. However, in general, the underlying mechanisms of this effect are poorly understood. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about how this important, but mysterious, epigenetic mark impacts cellular functions. Cytosine methylation can abrogate or enhance interactions with DNA-binding proteins, or it may have no effect, depending on the context. Despite being only a small chemical change, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine can affect base readout via hydrophobic contacts in the major groove and shape readout via electrostatic contacts in the minor groove. We discuss the recent discovery that CpG methylation increases DNase I cleavage at adjacent positions by an order of magnitude through altering the local 3D DNA shape and the possible implications of this structural insight for understanding the methylation sensitivity of transcription factors (TFs). Additionally, 5-methylcytosines change the stability of nucleosomes and, thus, affect the local chromatin structure and access of TFs to genomic DNA. Given these complexities, it seems unlikely that the influence of DNA methylation on protein-DNA binding can be captured in a small set of general rules. Hence, data-driven approaches may be essential to gain a better understanding of these mechanisms.",3.67,1228

Integration of HPV into the host genome may disrupt the E2 gene. Furthermore, methylation of CpG dinucleotides in E2-binding sites (E2BSs) in the HPV upstream regulatory region may interfere with transcriptional repression of E6 and E7 by E2. The authors hypothesized that the CpG methylation status of E2BS identifies subtypes of HPV type 16 (HPV16)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers (OPSCC) in association with E2 gene integrity and viral integration. METHODS: Methylation of 10 CpG dinucleotides within the upstream regulatory region, encompassing E2BSs 1, 2, 3, and 4, was quantitatively analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing in 57 HPV16-associated OPSCC cases. E2 status was analyzed by gene amplification and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Viral integration was determined by integration-specific polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: Three subgroups with differential methylation at E2BS3 and E2BS 4 were identified: 1) complete methylation (>80%) associated with the presence of integrated HPV genomes with an intact E2 gene; 2) intermediate methylation levels (20%-80%) with predominantly episomal HPV genomes with intact E2; and 3) no methylation (<20%) with a disrupted E2 gene. Patients with high methylation levels tended to have a worse 5-year overall survival compared with patients with intermediate methylation (hazard ratio, 3.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-9.24 [P = .06]). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of E2BS3 and E2BS4 in OPSCC is associated with E2 integrity and viral physical status. It might explain deregulated viral oncogene expression in the presence of E2. The prognostic significance of E2BS methylation for patients with HPV-associated OPSCC needs to be analyzed further.",4.889,337

To evaluate the methylation levels of six candidate genes (EGFR, GREM1, PDGFRB, PPM1E, SOX17, and WRN) in plasma cfDNA as biomarkers for breast cancer early detection, quantitative analysis of the promoter methylation of these genes from 86 breast cancer patients and 67 healthy controls was performed by using microfluidic-PCR-based target enrichment and next-generation bisulfite sequencing technology. The predictive performance of different logistic models based on methylation status of candidate genes was investigated by means of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and odds ratio (OR) analysis. Results revealed that EGFR, PPM1E, and 8 gene-specific CpG sites showed significantly hypermethylation in cancer patients' plasma and significantly associated with breast cancer (OR ranging from 2.51 to 9.88). The AUC values for these biomarkers were ranging from 0.66 to 0.75. Combinations of multiple hypermethylated genes or CpG sites substantially improved the predictive performance for breast cancer detection. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative measurement of candidate gene methylation in cfDNA by using microfluidic-PCR-based target enrichment and bisulfite next-generation sequencing, which is worthy of further validation and potentially benefits a broad range of applications in clinical oncology practice.

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, can modulate gene expression in response to the environment, and therefore might account for part of the heritability reported for BD. This paper aims to review evidence of the potential role of DNA methylation in the pathophysiology and treatment of BD. In summary, several studies suggest that alterations in DNA methylation may play an important role in the dysregulation of gene expression in BD, and some actually suggest their potential use as biomarkers to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of response to treatment. This is also supported by reports of alterations in the levels of DNA methyltransferases in patients and in the mechanism of action of classical mood stabilizers. In this sense, targeting specific alterations in DNA methylation represents exciting new treatment possibilities for BD, and the 'plastic' characteristic of DNA methylation accounts for a promising possibility of restoring environment-induced modifications in patients.",8.802,1637

METHODS: Comparing genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using Illumina Human methylation 450K arrays, we previously identified a list of loci that were differentially methylated between tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues. To examine if dysregulation of DNA methylation patterns observed in tumor tissues can be detected in white blood cell (WBC) DNA, we conducted a prospective case-control study nested within a community-based cancer screening cohort in Taiwan with 16 years of follow up. We measured methylation levels in ninety-six loci that were aberrant in DNA methylation in HCC tumor tissues compared to adjacent tissues. Baseline WBC DNA from 159 HCC cases and 312 matched controls were bisulfite treated and assayed by Illumina BeadArray. We used the chi(2) test for categorical variables and student's t-test for continuous variables to assess the difference in selected characteristics between cases and controls. To estimate associations with HCC risk, we used conditional logistic regression models stratified on the matching factors to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95%CI. RESULTS: We found that high methylation level in cg10272601 in WNK2 was associated with increased risk of HCC, with an OR of 1.91 (95%CI: 1.27-2.86). High methylation levels in both cg12680131 in TPO and cg22511877 in MYT1L, however, were associated with decreased risk. The ORs (95%CI) were 0.59 (0.39-0.87) and 0.50 (0.33-0.77), respectively, for those with methylation levels of cg12680131 and cg22511877 above the median compared with those with levels below the median. These associations were still statistically significant in multivariable conditional logistic regression models after adjusting for hepatitis B virus infection and alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: These findings support the measurement of methylation markers in WBC DNA as biomarkers of HCC susceptibility but should be replicated in additional prospective studies.",0,1084

Sperm global DNA methylation was evaluated by an ELISA-like method, DNA fragmentation was evaluated by flow cytometry-based terminal transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay (reported as DNA fragmentation index or DFI), and sperm denaturation was evaluated by aniline blue staining (reported as sperm denaturation index or SDI, a marker of chromatin compaction). We found a significant positive association between sperm global DNA methylation level and conventional sperm parameters (sperm concentration and motility), supported by the results of methylation analysis on H19-DMR. We also identified significant inverse relationships between sperm global DNA methylation, and, both DFI and SDI. However, sperm global DNA methylation level was not related to sperm vitality or morphology. Our findings suggest that global sperm DNA methylation levels are related to conventional sperm parameters, as well as, sperm chromatin and DNA integrity.",2.298,585

METHODS: We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study in dermal fibroblasts in six diffuse cutaneous SSc (dSSc) patients, six limited cutaneous SSc (lSSc) patients compared with 12 age-matched, sex-matched and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Cytosine methylation was quantified in more than 485 000 methylation sites across the genome. Differentially methylated CpG sites between patients and controls with a fold difference >/=1.2 were identified. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess correlation between DNA methylation changes and gene expression levels. RESULTS: We identified 2710 and 1021 differentially methylated CpG sites in dSSc and lSSc, respectively. Of the differentially methylated sites, 61% in dSSc and 90% in lSSc were hypomethylated. There were only 203 CpG sites differentially methylated in both dSSc and lSSc, representing 118 hypomethylated and 6 hypermethylated genes. Common hypomethylated genes include ITGA9, encoding an alpha integrin. Other relevant genes such as ADAM12, COL23A1, COL4A2 and MYO1E, and transcription factors genes RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 were also hypomethylated in both dSSc and lSSc. Pathway analysis of differentially methylated genes in both dSSc and lSSc revealed enrichment of genes involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and focal adhesion.

Infections are able to trigger susceptibility to disease and it can be considered as potential epimutagenic factors in reshaping the epigenome. Therefore, what would be the DNA methylation status in cells present in an infected and inflamed oral environment? The aim was to verify the DNA methylation pattern in oral epithelium cells from aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients in a specific gene involved in the inflammation control, as suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)1 and in a broader way through long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1. DESIGN: Genomic DNA from oral cells of 30 generalized AgP patients and 30 healthy patients were purified and modified by sodium bisulfite. DNA methylation patterns were analyzed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) for SOCS1 and LINE-1. RESULTS: An overall scenario of demethylation was seen for both groups, whereas the healthy group presented a higher percentage of demethylation (p<0.001), also presenting the majority of total demethylated samples (83.3% versus 70.8% in the AgP group). Total LINE-1 methylation or at each specific loci presented significant differences amongst groups. CONCLUSION: Epithelial cells, present in an infected and inflamed oral environment, show different DNA methylation status from those present in a healthy oral environment, regarding the SOCS1 and LINE-1. In addition, the investigation allows detecting alterations in the DNA in a non-limited manner, since the results observed might reflect a generalized condition of the oral epithelial cells, besides reflecting the condition of the gingival epithelium cells.",1.735,1839

In recent years, epigenetic modification of both DNA and histones such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation and methylation emerges as a potential regulatory mechanism that governs the transcription of several genes responsible for memory formation and behavior. Furthermore, the recent identification of nitrosylation of proteins has shown to either activate or repress gene transcription by modulating histone methylation or acetylation status in mature neuron. Recent studies suggest that the use of major substrates of abuse, e.g., cocaine, induces alterations in molecular and cellular mechanisms of epigenetics that underlie long-term memories in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Moreover, downregulation of genes due to alterations in epigenetics leads to cognitive deficiencies associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, psychiatric disorder such as Rett's syndrome and aging.

Our earlier studies indicated that the p45 isoform of the cellular AU-rich element binding protein 1 (AUF1) has an RNA chaperone activity, which supports RNA cyclization and viral RNA synthesis by destabilizing a stem structure at the WNV RNA's 3'-end. Here we show that in mammalian cells, AUF1 p45 is consistently modified by arginine methylation of its C terminus. By a combination of different experimental approaches, we can demonstrate that the methyltransferase PRMT1 is necessary and sufficient for AUF1 p45 methylation and that PRMT1 is required for efficient WNV replication. Interestingly, in comparison to the nonmethylated AUF1 p45, the methylated AUF1 p45aDMA exhibits a significantly increased affinity to the WNV RNA termini. Further data also revealed that the RNA chaperone activity of AUF1 p45aDMA is improved and the methylated protein stimulates viral RNA synthesis considerably more efficiently than the nonmethylated AUF1 p45. In addition to its destabilizing RNA chaperone activity, we identified an RNA annealing activity of AUF1 p45, which is not affected by methylation. Arginine methylation of AUF1 p45 thus represents a specific determinant of its RNA chaperone activity while functioning as a WNV host factor. Our data suggest that the methylation modifies the conformation of AUF1 p45 and in this way affects its RNA binding and restructuring activities.",0,1429

However, the ability to determine if a patient needs treatment is hindered by reliance on self-reporting and the clinician's capability to monitor the patient's response to treatment is challenged by the lack of reliable biomarkers. Using a genome-wide approach, we have previously shown that chronic alcohol use is associated with methylation changes in DNA from human cell lines. In this pilot study, we now examine DNA methylation in peripheral mononuclear cell DNA gathered from subjects as they enter and leave short-term alcohol treatment. When compared with abstinent controls, subjects with heavy alcohol use show widespread changes in DNA methylation that have a tendency to reverse with abstinence. Pathway analysis demonstrates that these changes map to gene networks involved in apoptosis. There is no significant overlap of the alcohol signature with the methylation signature previously derived for smoking.

The hormones secreted by this tissue play an important role in many biochemical processes. It is known that dysfunction of adipocytes can cause insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes or hyperlipidemia. One of the important factors produced in fat tissue is resistin (Retn). It has been postulated that this hormone is involved in glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. In the present study, the impact of five diet types (ad libitum normal, restricted, high-carbohydrate, high-fat and high-protein) on the Retn gene transcription and methylation profile was evaluated in rats of different ages. RESULTS: Transcript levels and methylation status of the Retn gene were studied in three tissues (muscle, subcutaneous and abdominal fat) in rats at 30, 60 and 120 days of age. We found an effect of tissue type on the Retn transcription in all diet types, as well as an effect of feeding type and age on the mRNA levels for high-fat and high-protein diets. The DNA methylation levels depended only on tissue type. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results demonstrate a tissue-specific expression pattern and a characteristic DNA methylation profile of the Retn gene in rats. Retn expression seems to be sensitive to nutritional changes, but only in the case of high-fat and high-protein diets. Moreover, an effect of age on Retn mRNA content was observed in these diets. Because no correlation between the transcript level and methylation status was found, we assumed that the transcription control of this gene by DNA methylation of the promoter seems to be unlikely.",2.397,513

Here, we investigated the differential DNA methylation within the LINE-1 under normal conditions and in response to environmentally relevant doses of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation. We demonstrate that DNA methylation of LINE-1 elements in the lungs of C57BL6 mice is dependent on their evolutionary age, where the elder age of the element is associated with the lower extent of DNA methylation. Exposure to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and methionine-deficient diet affected DNA methylation of selective LINE-1 elements in an age- and promoter type-dependent manner. Exposure to densely IR, but not sparsely IR, resulted in DNA hypermethylation of older LINE-1 elements, while the DNA methylation of evolutionary younger elements remained mostly unchanged. We also demonstrate that exposure to densely IR increased mRNA and protein levels of LINE-1 via the loss of the histone H3K9 dimethylation and an increase in the H3K4 trimethylation at the LINE-1 5'-untranslated region, independently of DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation is important for regulation of LINE-1 expression under normal conditions, but histone modifications may dictate the transcriptional activity of LINE-1 in response to exposure to densely IR.",4.373,526

 Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine",2015,"AURKC, a member of the Aurora kinase gene family, is highly expressed in testis but is either moderately expressed or repressed in most somatic cells. Varying expression of AURKC has been observed in human cancers, but the underlying mechanisms of differential expression have been investigated only to a limited extent. We investigated the role of promoter CpG methylation in the regulation of AURKC gene expression in human cancer cells, in relation to a recently reported AURKC transcription repressor PLZF/ZBTB16, implicated in transformation and tumorigenesis. AURKC and PLZF/ZBTB16 expression profiles were investigated in reference to CpG methylation status on the AURKC promoter experimentally, and also in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset involving multiple cancer types. AURKC promoter showed dense to moderate hypermethylation correlating with low to moderate expression of the gene in normal somatic cells and cancer cell lines, while testis with high expression revealed marked hypo-methylation. Treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-dC, but not the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, TSA, led to elevated expression in cancer cell lines, indicating that promoter DNA methylation negatively regulates AURKC expression. High expression of PLZF in PLZF-transfected cells treated with 5-aza-dC only partially repressed expression of AURKC despite 5-aza-dC also inducing elevated PLZF expression. Analyses of the TCGA data showed differential expression of AURKC in multiple cancer types and stronger correlation of AURKC expression with CpG methylation compared to PLZF levels. These findings demonstrate that differential promoter CpG methylation is an important mechanism regulating AURKC expression in cancer cells.",0,208

Epigenetic modification agents can improve genomic methylation reprogramming and the development of cloned embryos, however, the effect of epigenetic modification agents on gene-specific methylation reprogramming remains poorly studied. Here, we investigated DNA methylation reprogramming of pluripotency (Oct4) and tissue specific (Thy1) genes during early embryo development in pigs. In this study, we found that compared with in vitro fertilized counterparts, cloned embryos displayed the disrupted patterns of Oct4 demethylation and Thy1 remethylation. When 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) or trichostatin A (TSA) enhanced the development of cloned embryos, the transcripts of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a), histone acetyltransferase 1 (Hat1) and histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) and the methylation and expression patterns of Oct4 and Thy1 became similar to those detected in in vitro fertilized counterparts. Further studies showed that Dnmt1 knockdown in cloned embryos enhanced the methylation reprogramming of Oct4 and Thy1 and promoted the activation of Oct4 and the silence of Thy1. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that cloned embryos displayed incomplete gene-specific methylation reprogramming and disrupted expression patterns of pluripotency and tissue specific genes, and epigenetic modification agents improved gene-specific methylation reprogramming and expression pattern by regulating epigenetic modification related genes.

 Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association",2016,"BACKGROUNDS: Reportedly, the pyrosequencing methylation assay can produce inconsistent results between paired snap-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissue samples. In this study, we assayed the methylation levels at four individual CpG sites of L1 using pyrosequencing and found that the methylation levels at individual CpG sites were different but were closely correlated between paired snap-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. We aimed to determine whether low methylation status of L1 is associated with gastric cancer patient prognosis. METHODS: We analyzed 434 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of advanced gastric cancer for their methylation status at four CpG sites of L1 [nucleotide positions 328, 321, 318, and 306 of X58075 (Genbank)] using pyrosequencing, and correlated the L1 methylation level with clinicopathological features. RESULTS: Older age at onset, males, tumor location at antrum or lower body, intestinal type, and lymphatic or venous invasion were associated with a low average methylation level of L1 at the two CpG sites 1 and 4 combined. The average methylation level of L1 at CpG sites 1 and 4 combined was significantly lower in microsatellite-stable and EBV-negative gastric cancers than in EBV-positive or microsatellite-unstable gastric cancers. Low methylation status of L1 was independently correlated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival time. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the discrepancy in the methylation level of L1 between fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples depends on the CpG sites considered, and that the methylation status of L1 at CpG sites 1 and 4 combined could be utilized as a prognostic parameter for advanced gastric cancers.",0,1748

However, the full -scale DNA methylation profiling in chondrocyte dedifferentiation remains to be determined. Here, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of dedifferentiated chondrocytes in monolayer culture and chondrocytes treated with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC). This research revealed that the general methylation level of CpG was increased while the COL-1A1 promoter methylation level was decreased during the chondrocyte dedifferentiation. 5-AzaC could reduce general methylation levels and reverse the chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Surprisingly, the DNA methylation level of COL-1A1 promoter was increased after 5-AzaC treatment. The COL-1A1 expression level was increased while that of SOX-9 was decreased during the chondrocyte dedifferentiation. 5-AzaC treatment up-regulated the SOX-9 expression while down-regulated the COL-1A1 promoter activity and gene expression. Taken together, these results suggested that differential regulation of the DNA methylation level of cartilage-specific genes might contribute to the chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Thus, the epigenetic manipulation of these genes could be a potential strategy to counteract the chondrocyte dedifferentiation accompanying in vitro propagation.

In this study, we sought to develop and validate a quantitative MGMT methylation assay using pyrosequencing on glioblastoma. We quantified promoter methylation of MGMT using pyrosequencing on paraffin-embedded fine needle aspiration biopsy tissues from 43 glioblastoma. Using a 10% cutoff, MGMT methylation was identified in 37% cases of glioblastoma and 0% of the non-neoplastic epileptic tissue. Methylation of any individual CpG island in MGMT promoter ranged between 33% and 95%, with a mean of 65%. By a serial dilution of genomic DNA of a homogenously methylated cancer cell line with an unmethylated cell line, the analytical sensitivity is at 5% for pyrosequencing to detect MGMT methylation. The minimal amount of genomic DNA required is 100 ng (approximately 3,000 cells) in small fine needle biopsy specimens.

Blood samples were obtained from 114 glioma patients, 96 normal controls, and 81 glioma patients after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Blood-based DNA methylation of the five NHEJ repair genes was assayed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The DNA methylation level of XRCC5 and XRCC7 in glioma group are significantly higher than those of normal group (P<0.001). Moreover, radiotherapy treatment significantly increased methylation level of XRCC5 and XRCC7 compared to glioma group. No significant difference for the methylation of the other three genes, LIG4, XRCC4 and XRCC6 were detected among three groups. IN CONCLUSION: our findings indicate that DNA methylation modification plays an important role to regulate the gene expression of XRCC5 and XRCC7, from the results that the gene methylation level of the glioma group is higher than that of the normal group. Increased methylation of XRCC5 and XRCC7 in blood samples of glioma patients and patients with radiotherapy and chemotherapy suggests that blood-based methylation level of XRCC5 and XRCC7 could be a potential indicator for evaluating of the effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for glioma patient.",1.891,819

Steroid 5alpha-reductase type I is the rate-limiting enzyme in ALLO biosynthesis and plays an important role in control of the ALLO level in mammalian brain. In this study, we examined an epigenetic mechanism for transcriptional regulation of srd5a1, which codes for steroid 5alpha-reductase type I, using isolation-reared mice. The mRNA level of srd5a1 was decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in isolation-reared mice. Rearing in social isolation increased methylation of cytosines at -82 and -12 bp downstream of the transcription start site, which are located in a GC box element in the promoter region of srd5a1. Binding of Sp1, a ubiquitous transcription factor, to the GC box was decreased in the promoter region of srd5a1 in the PFC in isolation-reared mice. Site-specific methylation at cytosine -12 of a srd5a1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, but not that of cytosine -82, downregulated the promoter activity of srd5a1. These findings suggest that transcription of srd5a1 in brain is regulated by environmental factor-induced cytosine methylation in the promoter region. This finding could contribute to development of antidepressant and anxiolytic agents.",2.03,1001

We evaluated prostate cancer risk associated with the mean methylation level for each element using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: We did not observe a significant association with prostate cancer for LINE-1 [odds ratio (OR) for the highest compared to the lowest quartile = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.39, Ptrend  = 0.99] or Alu (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.68-1.29, Ptrend  = 0.69) methylation levels overall.

Methylmercury production was much higher under fumarate respiration when no sulfide was produced. During exponential growth, hgcA and hgcB gene expression levels were only slightly higher in the presence of inorganic mercury, and it was difficult to conclude whether there was a significant induction of hgcA and hgcB genes by inorganic mercury.

A number of studies have demonstrated altered DNA methylation of peripheral blood cells in schizophrenia (SCZ) in previous studies. However, most of these studies have been limited to the analysis of the CpG sites in CpG islands in gene promoter regions, and cell-type proportions of peripheral leukocytes, which may be one of the potential confounding factors for DNA methylation, have not been adjusted in these studies. In this study, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of the peripheral leukocytes from patients with SCZ and from non-psychiatric controls (N = 105; 63 SCZ and 42 control subjects) using a quantitative high-resolution DNA methylation microarray which covered across the whole gene region (485,764 CpG dinucleotides). In the DNA methylation data analysis, we first estimated the cell-type proportions of each sample with a published algorithm. Next, we performed a surrogate variable analysis to identify potential confounding factors in our microarray data. Finally, we conducted a multiple linear regression analysis in consideration of these factors, including estimated cell-type proportions, and identified aberrant DNA methylation in SCZ at 2,552 CpG loci at a 5% false discovery rate correction.

On the other hand, as an emerging research field, RNA methylation has drawn more and more attention recently, and the differential analysis of RNA methylation is significantly different from that of DNA methylation due to the impact of transcriptional regulation. We developed DRME to better address the differential RNA methylation problem. The proposed model can effectively describe within-group biological variability at small sample size scenario and handles the impact of transcriptional regulation on RNA methylation.

Presently, cytology on a physician-taken cervical scrape is mostly accepted as triage test, but needs follow-up testing in order not to miss severe disease. Here, we evaluated the performance of combined cytology and bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis as triage test on physician-taken cervical scrapes of HPV positive women. METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis, we used 364 left-over HPV positive cytology triage samples of participants of a randomized controlled trial (PROHTECT-3: n=46,001) performed in population-based cervical screening. Study endpoints were CIN2+ and CIN3+ detection. Cytology testing with and without methylation marker analysis was evaluated with regard to sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and referral rate. RESULTS: Bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation positivity increased proportionally with severity of underlying lesions. Overall, cytology and bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis yielded similar performances with regard to CIN3+ detection, yet in combination a significantly higher sensitivity for CIN3+ (88.7%) was obtained at a specificity of 53.6% and a colposcopy referral rate of 53.6%. The combined strategy detected all six cervical cancers, whereas triage by cytology alone failed to detect two of them. CONCLUSIONS: Cytology and bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis perform complementary for CIN2+/CIN3+ detection when used as triage tool on cervical scrapes of HPV positive women. This approach not only results in a higher CIN3+ sensitivity than cytology triage with an acceptable referral rate, but also seems to reduce the risk of missing cervical cancers and advanced high-grade lesions.",3.774,750

Recent data suggest that the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is functionally linked to the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint. We evaluated the prognostic value of aberrant CXCL12 DNA methylation with respect to PD-L1 expression in primary PCa. RESULTS: CXCL12 methylation showed a consistent significant correlation with Gleason grading groups in both cohorts (p < 0.001 for training and p = 0.034 for testing cohort). Short BCR-free survival was significantly associated with aberrant CXCL12 methylation in both cohorts and served as an independent prognostic factor in the testing cohort (hazard ratio = 1.92 [95%CI: 1.12-3.27], p = 0.049). Concomitant aberrant CXCL12 methylation and high PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with shorter BCR-free survival (p = 0.005). In comparative analysis, the CXCL12 methylation assay was able to provide approximately equivalent results in biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCL12 methylation was determined by means of a methylation specific quantitative PCR analysis in a radical prostatectomy patient cohort (n = 247, training cohort). Data published by The Cancer Genome Atlas served as a testing cohort (n = 498).

High-throughput profiling using techniques, such as Illumina's BeadArray assay, enable the quantitative assessment of methylation. Challenges arise from the fact that resulting methylation levels (so-called beta values) are proportions between 0 and 1, often from an asymmetric, bimodal distribution with peaks close to 0 and 1. Therefore, the majority of standard statistical approaches do not apply. The logit transformation into so-called M-values is a common approach to circumvent this problem and aims to allow the use of common statistical methods. However, it can be observed that the transformation from beta to M-values does not necessarily result in an approximately homoscedastic distribution. Often, bimodality, asymmetry and heteroscedasticity are conserved even after transformation. We give an overview and discussion of methods suggested in the recent years that attempt to address the characteristics of methylation data in univariate screening settings. In order to identify 'differential' methylation with respect to covariates of interest while adjusting for confounders, we compare parametric methods, such as linear and beta regression, and nonparametric methods, such as rank-based regression. Our goal is to sensitise researchers to the challenges and issues that arise from this type of data as well as to present possible solutions.",1.825,1382

The purpose of this study was to investigate DNMT1 gene and protein expression and the effects of methylation status on tumor suppressor genes in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines grown in vitro and in vivo Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 and H838, were grown in vitro and inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice to form tumors and were then treated with the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, with and without treatment with the benzamide histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat (MS-275). DNMT1 protein expression was quantified by Western blot. Promoter methylation status of tumor suppressor genes (RASSF1A, ASC, APC, MGMT, CDH13, DAPK, ECAD, P16, and GATA4) was evaluated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Methylation status of the tumor suppressor genes was regulated by the DNMT1 gene, with the decrease of DNMT1 expression following DNA methylation treatment. Demethylation of tumor suppressor genes (APC, ASC, and RASSF1A) restored tumor growth in nude mice. The results of this study support a role for methylation of DNA as a potential epigenetic clinical biomarker of prognosis or response to therapy and for DNMT1 as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.",1.548,473

Here, we investigated the contribution of both genetic variants and promoter methylation of the NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) gene to the cardiovascular and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to the socially evaluated cold pressor test (seCPT). RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-two healthy participants were recruited and underwent the experiment. They were randomly assigned to either the seCPT group (cold water) or a control group (warm water). The seCPT group had a clear stress reaction; salivary cortisol levels and peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure all increased significantly compared to the control group. GR genotype (TthIIII, NR3C1-I, 1H, E22E, R23K, BclI and 9beta) and methylation data were obtained from 218 participants. Haplotypes were built from the GR genotypes, and haplotype 2 (minor allele of BclI) carriers had a higher cortisol response to the seCPT in comparison to non-carriers (20.77 +/- 13.22; 14.99 +/- 8.42; p = 0.034), as well as independently of the experimental manipulation, higher baseline heart rate (72.44 +/- 10.99; 68.74 +/- 9.79; p = 0.022) and blood pressure (115.81 +/- 10.47; 111.61 +/- 10.74; p = 0.048). Average methylation levels throughout promoter 1F and 1H were low (2.76 and 1.69 %, respectively), but there was a strong correlation between individual CpGs and the distance separating them (Pearson's correlation r = 0.725, p = 3.03 x 10(-26)). Higher promoter-wide methylation levels were associated with decreased baseline blood pressure, and when incorporated into a linear mixed effect model significantly predicted lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure evolution over time in response to the experimental manipulation. The underlying genotype significantly predicted methylation levels; particularly, the homozygous BclI minor allele was associated with higher methylation in promoter 1H (p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies linking epigenetic modifications of the GR promoter, receptor genotype and physiological measures of the stress response. At baseline, there were clear genetic and epigenetic effects on blood pressure. The seCPT induced a strong cardiovascular and HPA axis response, and both systems were affected by the functional genetic variants, although methylation also predicted blood pressure reactivity. The return to baseline was predominantly influenced by the genomic sequence. Overall, the physiological response to the seCPT is controlled by an exquisite mix of genetic and epigenetic factors.",4.543,93

In the present analysis, for the first time a pharmacoepigenetic approach was applied investigating the influence of DNA methylation patterns in the MAO-A regulatory and exon1/intron1 region on antidepressant treatment response. 94 patients of Caucasian descent with major depressive disorder (f = 61; DSM-IV) were analyzed for DNA methylation status at 43 MAO-A CpG sites via direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite treated DNA extracted from blood cells. Patients were also genotyped for the functional MAO-A VNTR. Clinical response to antidepressant treatment with escitalopram was assessed by intra-individual changes of HAM-D-21 scores after 6 weeks of treatment. Apart from two CpG sites, male subjects showed no or only very minor methylation. In female patients, lower methylation at two individual CpG sites in the MAO-A promoter region was nominally associated with impaired response to antidepressant treatment after 6 weeks (GRCh37/hg19: CpG 43.514.063, p = 0.04; CpG 43.514.684, p = 0.009), not, however, withstanding correction for multiple testing. MAO-A VNTR genotypes did not influence MAO-A methylation status. The present pilot data do not suggest a major influence of MAO-A DNA methylation on antidepressant treatment response. However, the presently observed trend towards CpG-specific MAO-A gene hypomethylation-possibly via increased gene expression and consecutively decreased serotonin and/or norepinephrine availability-to potentially drive impaired antidepressant treatment response in female patients might be worthwhile to be followed up in larger pharmacoepigenetic studies.",0.608,1221

RNA and protein analysis of a panel of breast cancer cell lines revealed that BRCA1 deficiency is associated with the downregulation of FOXA1 expression. Knockdown of BRCA1 resulted in the downregulation of FOXA1 expression and enhancement of FOXA1 promoter methylation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, whereas the reconstitution of BRCA1 in Brca1-deficent mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs) promoted Foxa1 expression and methylation. These data suggest that BRCA1 suppresses FOXA1 hypermethylation and silencing. Consistently, the treatment of MMECs with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycitydine induced Foxa1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, treatment with GSK126, an inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity, induced FOXA1 expression in BRCA1-deficient but not in BRCA1-reconstituted MMECs. Likewise, the depletion of EZH2 by small interfering RNA enhanced FOXA1 mRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that BRCA1, EZH2, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)1/3a/3b and H3K27me3 are recruited to the endogenous FOXA1 promoter, further supporting the hypothesis that these proteins interact to modulate FOXA1 methylation and repression. Further co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP analysis showed that both BRCA1 and DNMT3b form complexes with EZH2 but not with each other, consistent with the notion that BRCA1 binds to EZH2 and negatively regulates its methyltransferase activity. We also found that EZH2 promotes and BRCA1 impairs the deposit of the gene silencing histone mark H3K27me3 on the FOXA1 promoter. These associations were validated in a familial breast cancer patient cohort. Integrated analysis of the global gene methylation and expression profiles of a set of 33 familial breast tumours revealed that FOXA1 promoter methylation is inversely correlated with the transcriptional expression of FOXA1 and that BRCA1 mutation breast cancer is significantly associated with FOXA1 methylation and downregulation of FOXA1 expression, providing physiological evidence to our findings that FOXA1 expression is regulated by methylation and chromatin silencing and that BRCA1 maintains FOXA1 expression through suppressing FOXA1 gene methylation in breast cancer.",8.459,329

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are ubiquitously used flame-retardants, could leach into the environment; and become persistent organic pollutants via bioaccumulation. In the United States, blood PBDE levels in adults range from 30-100 ng/g- lipid but the alarming health concern revolves around children who have reported blood PBDE levels 3 to 9-fold higher than adults. PBDEs disrupt endocrine, immune, reproductive and nervous systems. However, the mechanism underlying its adverse health effect is not fully understood. Epigenetics is a possible biological mechanism underlying maternal exposure-child health outcomes by regulating gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence. We sought to examine the relationship between maternal exposure to environmental PBDEs and promoter methylation of a proinflammatory gene, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). We measured the maternal blood PBDE levels and cord blood TNFalpha promoter methylation levels on 46 paired samples of maternal and cord blood from the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC). We showed that decreased cord blood TNFalpha methylation associated with high maternal PBDE47 exposure. CpG site-specific methylation showed significantly hypomethylation in the girl whose mother has a high blood PBDE47 level. Consistently, decreased TNFalpha methylation associated with an increase in TNFalpha protein level in cord blood. In conclusion, our finding provided evidence that in utero exposure to PBDEs may epigenetically reprogram the offspring's immunological response through promoter methylation of a proinflammatory gene.",3.234,1650

Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is widely known as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway via the inactivation of beta-catenin. An increasing number of studies have reported that APC methylation contributes to the predisposition to breast cancer (BC). However, recent studies have yielded conflicting results. Methods. Herein, we systematically carried out a meta-analysis to assess the correlation between APC methylation and BC risk. Based on searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) values were pooled and summarized. Results. A total of 31 articles involving 35 observational studies with 2,483 cases and 1,218 controls met the inclusion criteria. The results demonstrated that the frequency of APC methylation was significantly higher in BC cases than controls under a random effect model (OR = 8.92, 95% CI [5.12-15.52]). Subgroup analysis further confirmed the reliable results, regardless of the sample types detected, methylation detection methods applied and different regions included. Interestingly, our results also showed that the frequency of APC methylation was significantly lower in early-stage BC patients than late-stage ones (OR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.42-0.93]). Conclusion.

Furthermore, it plays a significant role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In order to elucidate the influence of DNA methylation during B-cell development, genome-wide DNA methylation status of pro-B, pre-BI, pre-BII, and naive-B-cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood was determined using the methylated CpG island recovery assay followed by next generation sequencing. On average, 182-200 million sequences were generated for each precursor B-cell subset in 10 biological replicates. An overall decrease in methylation was observed during the transition from pro-B to pre-BI, whereas no differential methylation was observed in the pre-BI to pre-BII transition or in the pre-BII to naive B-cell transition. Most of the methylated regions were located within intergenic and intronic regions not present in a CpG island context. Putative novel enhancers were identified in these regions that were differentially methylated between pro-B and pre-BI cells.

While this type of approach is likely sufficient for most somatic cell lines, it is problematic in a tissue where a single cell is disproportionality influential. Furthermore, we know very little about the epigenetic variability between different sperm from the same ejaculate. Thus, it is essential that we better understand the heterogeneity of sperm epigenetic marks within an ejaculate. In this study, we have performed sperm genome-wide DNA methylation analyses on single ejaculates from 20 individuals. Sperm samples were subjected to gradient separation, following which the 90% layer ('high-quality sperm') and the 35% layer ('low-quality sperm') were isolated and analyzed separately using the Illumina 450K methylation array. We did not identify any single CpG that was differentially methylated between the two fractions. In contrast, we did identify 772 significant regional methylation alterations between the two layers. Coefficient of variance analysis also revealed that, in addition to having multiple sites that appear to be differentially methylated, the 35% layer sperm population, as a whole, displayed significantly higher variability in DNA methylation than did the 90% layer. In conclusion, while the two sperm populations analyzed here do not appear to be entirely distinct, those sperm that are generally considered to be of 'poor-quality' display some consistent regions of alteration and, more strikingly, demonstrate more heterogeneity than sperm considered to be of more normal quality.",3.747,1237

Photoperiod-B1a (Ppd-B1a) is one of the major genes that confers photoperiod insensitivity in 'Green Revolution' varieties, and has made a significant contribution to wheat yield improvement. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the photoperiod insensitivity of Ppd-B1a alleles from an epigenetic perspective using a combination of bisulfite genomic sequencing, orthologous comparative analysis, association analysis, linkage analysis and gene expression analysis. Based on the study of a large collection of wheat germplasm, we report two methylation haplotypes of Ppd-B1 and demonstrate that the higher methylation haplotype (haplotype a) was associated with increased copy numbers and higher expression levels of the Ppd-B1 gene, earlier heading and photoperiod insensitivity. Furthermore, assessment of the distribution frequency of the different methylation haplotypes suggested that the methylation patterns have undergone selection during the wheat breeding process. Our study suggests that DNA methylation in the regulatory region of the Ppd-B1 alleles, which is closely related to copy number variation, plays a significant role in wheat breeding, to confer photoperiod insensitivity and better adaptation to a wider geographical range.",0,1548

However, the mechanism of DNA-methylation-dependent gene regulation is not fully understood. Here, we explore two possible DNA methylation regulatory mechanisms with opposite modes of gene expression regulation. RESULTS: By comparing the genome-wide methylation and expression patterns in different tissues, we find that majority of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) are negatively correlated with expression of their associated genes (negative T-DMRs), consistent with the classical dogma that DNA methylation suppresses gene expression; however, a significant portion of T-DMRs are positively correlated with gene expression (positive T-DMRs). We observe that the positive T-DMRs have similar genomic location as negative T-DMRs, except that the positive T-DMRs are more enriched in the promoter regions. Both positive and negative T-DMRs are enriched in DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs), suggesting that both are likely to be functional. The CpG sites of both positive and negative T-DMRs are also more evolutionarily conserved than the genomic background. Interestingly, the putative target genes of the positive T-DMR are enriched for negative regulators such as transcriptional repressors, suggesting a novel mode of indirect DNA methylation inhibition of expression through transcriptional repressors. Likewise, two distinct sets of DNA sequence motifs exist for positive and negative T-DMRs, suggesting that two distinct sets of transcription factors (TFs) are involved in positive and negative regulation mediated by DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: We find both negative and positive association between T-DMRs and gene expression, which implies the existence of two different mechanisms of DNA methylation-dependent gene regulation.",3.986,1017

This may partly be mediated by mechanisms related to DNA methylation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated associations between exposure to air pollution, using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as marker, and epigenome-wide cord blood DNA methylation. METHODS: We meta-analyzed the associations between NO2 exposure at residential addresses during pregnancy and cord blood DNA methylation (Illumina 450K) in four European and North-American studies (n=1,508) with subsequent look-up analyses in children aged 4 (n=733) and 8 (n=786) years. Additionally, we applied a literature-based candidate approach for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes. To assess influence of exposure at the transcriptomics level, we related mRNA expression in blood cells to NO2 exposure in 4- (n=111) and 16-year-olds (n=239). RESULTS: We found epigenome-wide significant associations (false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.05) between maternal NO2 exposure during pregnancy and DNA methylation in newborns for 3 CpG sites in mitochondria-related genes: cg12283362 (LONP1), cg24172570 (3.8 kbp upstream of HIBADH), and cg08973675 (SLC25A28). The associations with cg08973675 methylation were also significant in the older children. Further analysis of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes revealed differentially methylated CpGs in CAT and TPO in newborns (FDR p<0.05). NO2 exposure at the time of biosampling in childhood had significant impact on CAT and TPO expression.

In this study, we analyzed possible alterations in levels and patterns of cytosine methylation in male and female spinach plants after treatment with demethylation agent 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) using two methods: (1) direct determination of 5-methylcytidine (5 mC) amounts in genomic DNA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and quantification of nucleosides and (2) methylation-sensitive inter-simple sequence repeat (MS-ISSR) technique. HPLC analysis revealed that the DNA methylation events in male and female spinach leaves markedly decreased upon 30 muM 5-azaC treatment, and the methylation level gradually decreased with the increase in 5-azaC concentration. To study the altered DNA methylation patterns in spinach after 5-azaC treatment, untreated and 500 muM 5-azaC-treated samples were analyzed by MS-ISSR assay. A total of 385 informative profiles were resolved using 35 ISSR primer sets. MS-ISSR analysis showed various altered methylation patterns between untreated and 5-azaC-treated spinach plants. These alterations were mainly demethylation events, which were largely consistent with the HPLC results. Both HPLC and MS-ISSR analyses showed that the changes in DNA methylation levels and patterns were similar in male and female spinach leaves, which implies that sex was not the main factor influencing DNA methylation levels and patterns in the vegetative organs of spinach. This study could provide a molecular basis of the altered DNA methylation induced by 5-azaC, and lay a foundation for further investigation of the relationship between methylation and sex determination and development in this dioecious plant spinach.",1.852,1631

The present study was undertaken to investigate whether methylation occurs also in non-neoplastic brains by collecting 45 non-neoplastic brains from autopsies and 56 lobectomy specimens from epileptic surgeries. The promoter methylation status of MGMT was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PSQ), while protein expression was studied by immunohistochemical stain (IHC). The methylation rates, as determined by MSP and PSQ, were 3.0 % (3/101) and 2.9 % (2/69), respectively. Of note, no case had positive result concomitantly from both MSP and PSQ (3 were MSP+/PSQ- and 2 were MSP-/PSQ+), and all the positive samples were further confirmed by cloning and Sanger sequencing. All the methylated cases, except for those having indeterminate IHC results from autopsy specimens, revealed no loss of MGMT protein expression and similar staining pattern to that of the unmethylated cases. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that MGMT promoter methylation could occur in a low percentage of non-neoplastic brains but did not affect the status of protein expression, which could be regarded as a normal variation in non-neoplastic brains.",3.07,1493

METHODS: In a retrospective design, methylation of 10 genes was analyzed on tumor specimens belonging to 664 consecutive patients treated by RNU for primary UTUC. Median follow-up was 48 mo (range: 3-144 mo). Gene methylation was accessed by methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction, and we calculated the methylation index (MI), a reflection of the extent of methylation.

Promoter methylation for at least one gene promoter locus was present in 88.9% of UTUC. Fewer methylation and lower MI (P = 0.001) were seen in the tumors with contralateral UTUC recurrence than the tumors without contralateral recurrence. High MI (P = 0.007) was significantly correlated with poor cancer-specific survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that unmethylated RASSF1A (P = 0.039), lack of bladder recurrence prior to contralateral UTUC (P = 0.009), history of renal transplantation (P < 0.001), and preoperative renal insufficiency (P = 0.002) are independent risk factors for contralateral UTUC recurrence after RNU. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a potential role of DNA methylation in predicting contralateral UTUC recurrence after RNU. Such information could help identify patients at high risk of new contralateral UTUC recurrence after RNU who need close surveillance during follow up.",1.087,1214

ChIP-seq is a powerful technique to empirically define TF binding in vivo. However, the multitude of distinct TFs makes genome-wide profiling for them all labor-intensive and costly. Algorithms for in silico prediction of TF binding have been developed, based mostly on histone modification or DNase I hypersensitivity data in conjunction with DNA motif and other genomic features. However, technical limitations of these methods prevent them from being applied broadly, especially in clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive survey involving multiple cell lines, TFs, and methylation types and found that there are intimate relationships between TF binding and methylation level changes around the binding sites. Exploiting the connection between DNA methylation and TF binding, we proposed a novel supervised learning approach to predict TF-DNA interaction using data from base-resolution whole-genome methylation sequencing experiments. We devised beta-binomial models to characterize methylation data around TF binding sites and the background. Along with other static genomic features, we adopted a random forest framework to predict TF-DNA interaction. After conducting comprehensive tests, we saw that the proposed method accurately predicts TF binding and performs favorably versus competing methods.",9.112,1850

Epigenetic alterations are suggested to play a pivotal role in modulating the phenotypic expression of CHDs and their clinical course during life. Candidate approaches implied that DNA methylation might have a developmental role in CHD and contributes to the long-term progress of non-structural cardiac diseases. The aim of the present study is to define the postnatal epigenome of two common cardiac malformations, representing epigenetic memory, and adaption to hemodynamic alterations, which are jointly relevant for the disease course. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present the first analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data obtained from myocardial biopsies of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and ventricular septal defect patients. We defined stringent sets of differentially methylated regions between patients and controls, which are significantly enriched for genomic features like promoters, exons, and cardiac enhancers. For TOF, we linked DNA methylation with genome-wide expression data and found a significant overlap for hypermethylated promoters and down-regulated genes, and vice versa. We validated and replicated the methylation of selected CpGs and performed functional assays. We identified a hypermethylated novel developmental CpG island in the promoter of SCO2 and demonstrate its functional impact. Moreover, we discovered methylation changes co-localized with novel, differential splicing events among sarcomeric genes as well as transcription factor binding sites. Finally, we demonstrated the interaction of differentially methylated and expressed genes in TOF with mutated CHD genes in a molecular network. CONCLUSION: By interrogating DNA methylation and gene expression data, we identify two novel mechanism contributing to the phenotypic expression of CHDs: aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands and methylation alterations leading to differential splicing.",5.94,469

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess PAX1 gene methylation as a potential biomarker in cervical cancer screening. METHODS: A systematical search of all major databases was performed, in order to include all relevant publications in English until December 31(st) 2014. Studies with insufficient data, conducted in experimental models or associated with other comorbidities were excluded from the meta-analysis. Summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2(+)) versus normal, and CIN grade 3 or worse (CIN3(+)) versus normal, were estimated using the bivariate model. RESULTS: Out of the 20 initially included studies, finally 7 (comprising of 1385 subjects with various stages of CIN and normal cervical pathology) met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of CIN2(+) versus normal was estimated to be 0.66 (CI 95%, 0.46-0.81) and the specificity 0.92 (CI 95%, 0.88-0.95). On the other hand, the sensitivity of CIN3(+) versus normal was 0.77 (CI 95%, 0.58-0.89) and the specificity 0.92 (CI 95%, 0.88-0.94). Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) in the former case was 0.923, and in the latter 0.931. CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis support the utility of PAX1 methylation as an auxiliary biomarker in cervical cancer screening.

Indeed, glioma CpG island hypermethylated phenotype has been identified as prognostic biomarker and as a surrogate marker of IDH1/2 mutations. However, the role of DNA methylation in glioblastoma progression is unknown. We sought to analyze DNA methylation levels in paired (initial and recurrent) primary glioblastoma samples to identify candidate pathways that may prone to glioblastoma progression. We have analyzed 12 samples (5 paired samples, two of them with three surgeries) using methylation arrays. We have analyzed differential methylation at probe and at gene region level. Finally, pathway analysis has been performed using differentially methylated regions. All analysis has been performed with R and Bioconductor packages. Mean methylation level at initial sample compared to recurrence was strongly positively correlated (R(2) = 0.98). There was no differentially methylation at probe level. However, at gene level 3080 regions were differentially methylated. Interestingly, pathways analysis showed that the most differentially methylated genes are involved in cellular response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulus (GO:0036006). Methylation levels were strongly conserved when comparing initial to recurrence in primary glioblastomas. Interestingly, differentially methylated pathway analysis suggests that a modulation of methylation in immune response genes may play a role in glioblastoma progression.

Despite the intriguing advancements, little is known so far about the dynamic landscape of RNA methylome across different cell types and how the epitranscriptome is regulated at the system level by enzymes, i.e., RNA methyltransferases and demethylases. To investigate this issue, a meta-analysis of m6A MeRIP-Seq datasets collected from 10 different experimental conditions (cell type/tissue or treatment) is performed, and the combinatorial epitranscriptome, which consists of 42 758 m6A sites, is extracted and divided into 3 clusters, in which the methylation sites are likely to be hyper- or hypo-methylated simultaneously (or co-methylated), indicating the sharing of a common methylation regulator. Four different clustering approaches are used, including K-means, hierarchical clustering (HC), Bayesian factor regression model (BFRM) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to unveil the co-methylation patterns. To validate whether the patterns are corresponding to enzymatic regulators, i.e., RNA methyltransferases or demethylases, the target sites of a known m6A regulator, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), are identified from an independent mouse MeRIP-Seq dataset and lifted to human. Our study shows that 3 out of the 4 clustering approaches used can successfully identify a group of methylation sites overlapping with FTO target sites at a significance level of 0.05 (after multiple hypothesis adjustment), among which, the result of NMF is the most significant (p-value 2.81x10(-06)). We defined a new approach evaluating the consistency between two clustering results which shows that clustering results of different methods are highly correlated strongly indicating the existence of co-methylation patterns. Consistent with recent studies, a number of cancer and neuronal disease-related bimolecular functions are enriched in the identified clusters, which are biological functions that can be regulated at the epitranscriptional level, indicating the pharmaceutical prospect of RNA N6-methyladenosine-related studies. This result successfully reveals the linkage between the global RNA co-methylation patterns embedded in the epitranscriptomic data under multiple experimental conditions and the latent enzymatic regulators, suggesting a promising direction towards a more comprehensive understanding of the epitranscriptome.",3.21,225

DNA methylation has an important role in gene regulation; therefore, we examined DNA methylation at promoters of 12 genes from 5q31 and 17q12-q21 regions. Our goal was to determine whether DNA methylation was associated with predisposition to asthma and whether such a relationship was independent from genetic association. METHODS: Using sodium bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing methylation assays, we examined the effect of genotype on DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells from individuals from the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean asthma familial collection and lymphoblastoid cell lines. RESULTS: The local genotype influenced methylation levels of solute carrier family 22 (organic 3 cation/carnitine transporter) member 5 (SLC22A5), zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2) and gasdermin A (GSDMA) promoter regions. The genotype had a dominant effect on ZPBP2 and GSDMA methylation with lower methylation levels in individuals that carry the asthma-predisposing alleles. Males also had lower methylation at the ZPBP2 promoter than females. We did not observe an effect of asthma status that would be independent of the genotype and the sex effects in the GSDMA, ZPBP2 and SLC22A5 regions; however, GSDMA and ZPBP2 data were suggestive of interaction between asthma and methylation levels in females and SLC22A5 in males. CONCLUSIONS: The local genotype influences methylation levels at SLC22A5 and ZPBP2 promoters independently of the asthma status. Further studies are necessary to confirm the relationship between GSDMA-ZPBP2 and SLC22A5 methylation and asthma in females and males separately.",6.335,1325

The major G allele of rs12041331, an intronic cytosine guanine dinucleotide-single-nucleotide polymorphism (CpG-SNP), is associated with higher PEAR1 expression in platelets and endothelial cells than the minor A allele. The molecular mechanism underlying this difference remains elusive. We have characterized the histone modification profiles of the intronic region surrounding rs12041331 and identified H3K4Me1 enhancer-specific enrichment for the region that covers the CpG-SNP. Interestingly, methylation studies revealed that the CpG site is fully methylated in leukocytes of GG carriers. Nuclear protein extracts from megakaryocytes, endothelial cells, vs control HEK-293 cells show a 3-fold higher affinity for the methylated G allele compared with nonmethylated G or A alleles in a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To understand the positive relationship between methylation and gene expression, we studied DNA methylation at 4 different loci of PEAR1 during in vitro megakaryopoiesis. During differentiation, the CpG-SNP remained fully methylated, while we observed rapid methylation increases at the CpG-island overlapping the first 5'-untranslated region exon, paralleling the increased PEAR1 expression. In the same region, A-allele carriers of rs12041331 showed significantly lower DNA methylation at CGI1 compared with GG homozygote. This CpG-island contains binding sites for the methylation-sensitive transcription factor CTCF, whose binding is known to play a role in enhancer activation and/or repression. In conclusion, we report the molecular characterization of the first platelet function-related CpG-SNP, a genetic predisposition that reinforces PEAR1 enhancer activity through allele-specific DNA methylation.",10.452,1284

Methylation status of cancer-related genes is considered to be a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of tumors. This study investigated the methylation status of the Sox17 gene in breast cancer tissue and its corresponding plasma DNA to evaluate the association of methylation levels with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis.The methylation status of the Sox17 gene promoter was evaluated with methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in 155 paired breast cancer tissue and plasma samples and in 60 paired normal breast tissue and plasma samples. Association of Sox17 methylation status with clinicopathological parameters was analyzed by chi tests. Overall and disease-free survival (DFS) curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the differences between curves were analyzed by log-rank tests.The frequency of Sox17 gene methylation was 72.9% (113/155) in breast cancer tissues and 58.1% (90/155) in plasma DNA. Sox17 gene methylation was not found in normal breast tissues or in their paired plasma DNA. There was a significant correlation of Sox17 methylation between corresponding tumor tissues and paired plasma DNA (r = 0.688, P < 0.001). Aberrant Sox17 methylation in cancer tissues and in plasma DNA was significantly associated with the tumor node metastasis stage (P = 0.035 and P = 0.001, respectively) and with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that aberrant Sox17 promoter methylation in cancer tissues and plasma DNA was associated with poor DFS (P < 0.005) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.005).

Here, we describe a life span screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is designed to identify amino acid residues of histones that regulate yeast replicative aging. Our results reveal that lack of sustained histone H3K36 methylation is commensurate with increased cryptic transcription in a subset of genes in old cells and with shorter life span. In contrast, deletion of the K36me2/3 demethylase Rph1 increases H3K36me3 within these genes, suppresses cryptic transcript initiation, and extends life span. We show that this aging phenomenon is conserved, as cryptic transcription also increases in old worms. We propose that epigenetic misregulation in aging cells leads to loss of transcriptional precision that is detrimental to life span, and, importantly, this acceleration in aging can be reversed by restoring transcriptional fidelity.",10.798,751

In this study, we found out that the quenching of ROS generation by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS, reversed sanguinarine-induced apoptosis effects, also we found out that sanguinarine-induced rat hepatic stellate T6 cells (HSC-T6 cells) apoptosis was correlated with the generation of increased ROS, which was followed by the activation of caspase-8 (-3, -6, and -9), and the decreasing in the miltochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. It is not clear whether BCL2's downregulation relates to its promoter methylation and miR-15a/16-1 expression which can bind to BCL2 3'-UTR (un-translation reagon). We showed that sanguinarine-induced down regulation of BCL2 was associated with the increased methylation rate of BCL2 promotor district and the increased expression of miR-15a/16-1. HSC-T6 cells treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-Aza-CdR) impeded sanguinarine-induced BCL2 promotor district methylation and recovered BCL2's expression. Over expression of BCL2 using pEGFP-N1 vector decreased sanguinarine-induced HSC-T6 cells apoptotic death significantly but not completely. These observations clearly showed that BCL2 down regulation was associated with its promoter methylation and miR-15a/16-1 upregulation in sanguinarine-induced Rat HSC-T6 cells.",2.36,258

Sequencing-based methods are promising in fulfilling this task. However, none of the currently available methods offers the 'perfect solution', and they have limitations that prevent their application in the less studied phylogenetic groups. The recently discovered Mrr-like enzymes are appealing for new method development, owing to their ability to collect 32-bp methylated DNA fragments from the whole genome for high-throughput sequencing. Here, we have developed a simple and scalable DNA methylation profiling method (called MethylRAD) using Mrr-like enzymes. MethylRAD allows for de novo (reference-free) methylation analysis, extremely low DNA input (e.g. 1 ng) and adjustment of tag density, all of which are still unattainable for most widely used methylation profiling methods such as RRBS and MeDIP. We performed extensive analyses to validate the power and accuracy of our method in both model (plant Arabidopsis thaliana) and non-model (scallop Patinopecten yessoensis) species. We further demonstrated its great utility in identification of a gene (LPCAT1) that is potentially crucial for carotenoid accumulation in scallop adductor muscle. MethylRAD has several advantages over existing tools and fills a void in the current epigenomic toolkit by providing a universal tool that can be used for diverse research applications, e.g. from model to non-model species, from ordinary to precious samples and from small to large genomes, but at an affordable cost.",5.784,228

Here, we have determined the methylation levels associated with 5238 loci belonging to 2 Alu subfamilies, AluYa5 and AluYb8, using high-throughput targeted repeat element bisulfite sequencing (HT-TREBS). The results indicate that  approximately 90% of loci are repressed by high methylation levels. Of the remaining loci, many of the hypomethylated elements are found near gene promoters and show high levels of DNA methylation variation. We have characterized this variation in the context of tumorigenesis and interindividual differences. Comparison of a primary breast tumor and its matched normal tissue revealed early DNA methylation changes in  approximately 1% of AluYb8 elements in response to tumorigenesis. Simultaneously, AluYa5/Yb8 elements proximal to promoters also showed differences in methylation of up to one order of magnitude, even between normal individuals. Overall, the current study demonstrates that early loss of methylation occurs during tumorigenesis in a subset of young Alu elements, suggesting their potential clinical relevance. However, approaches such as deep-bisulfite-sequencing of individual loci using HT-TREBS are required to distinguish clinically relevant loci from the background observed for AluYa5/Yb8 elements in general with regard to high levels of interindividual variation in DNA methylation.",4.78,1258

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are still poorly understood and therefore warrant systematic research. Here, we document novel epigenetic abnormalities in the mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Ethanol treatment of P7 mice, which induces activation of caspase 3, impaired DNA methylation through reduced DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3A) levels. Inhibition of caspase 3 activity, before ethanol treatment, rescued DNMT1, DNMT3A proteins as well as DNA methylation levels. Blockade of histone methyltransferase (G9a) activity or cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1R), prior to ethanol treatment, which, respectively, inhibits or prevents activation of caspase 3, rescued the DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation. No reduction of DNMT1 and DNMT3A proteins and DNA methylation was found in P7 CB1R null mice, which exhibit no ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3. Together, these data demonstrate that ethanol-induced activation of caspase 3 impairs DNA methylation through DNMT1 and DNMT3A in the neonatal mouse brain, and such impairments are absent in CB1R null mice. Epigenetic events mediated by DNA methylation may be one of the essential mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis. Schematic mechanism of action by which ethanol impairs DNA methylation.

The risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer is estimated based on the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer score, a combination of several clinicopathological variables. However, pathological assessment is not objective and reproducibility is insufficient. The use of molecular markers could contribute to the estimation of tumor aggressiveness. We recently demonstrated that methylation of GATA2, TBX2, TBX3, and ZIC4 genes could predict progression in Ta tumors. In this study, we aimed to validate the markers in a large patient set using DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. PALGA: the Dutch Pathology Registry was used for patient selection. We included 192 patients with pTaG1/2 bladder cancer of whom 77 experienced progression. Methylation analysis was performed and log-rank analysis was used to calculate the predictive value of each methylation marker for developing progression over time. This analysis showed better progression-free survival in patients with low methylation rates compared with the patients with high methylation rates for all markers (P<0.001) during a followup of ten-years. The combined predictive effect of the methylation markers was analyzed with the Cox-regression method. In this analysis, TBX2, TBX3, and ZIC4 were independent predictors of progression. On the basis of methylation status of TBX2 and TBX3, patients were divided into three new molecular grade groups. Survival analysis showed that only 8% of patients in the low molecular grade group progressed within 5 years. This was 29 and 63% for the intermediate- and high-molecular grade groups.

 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",2014,"INTRODUCTION: While retrospective analyses support an association between early tumor recurrence and tumor suppressor gene promoter methylation in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), few studies have investigated this question prospectively. METHODS: Primary tumor tissue from patients with resected pathologic stage I to IIIA NSCLCs was collected at the time of surgery and analyzed for promoter methylation via methylation-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MethyLight). The primary objective was to determine an association between promoter methylation of 10 individual tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A, CDH13, RASSF1, APC, MGMT, GSTP1, DAPK1, WIF1, SOCS3, and ADAMTS8) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), with the secondary objectives of determining association with overall survival (OS), and relation to clinical or pathologic features. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients had sufficient tumor tissue for successful promoter methylation analysis. Majority of patients were former/current smokers (88%) with lung adenocarcinoma (78%) and pathologic stage I disease (62%). Median follow-up was 4 years. When controlled for pathologic stage, promoter methylation of the individual genes CDKN2A, CDH13, RASSF1, APC, MGMT, GSTP1, DAPK1, WIF1, and ADAMTS8 was not associated with RFS. Promoter methylation of the same genes was not associated with OS except for DAPK1 which was associated with improved OS (p = 0.03). The total number of genes with methylated promoters did not correlate with RFS (p = 0.89) or OS (p = 0.55). CONCLUSION: Contrary to data established by previous retrospective series, tumor suppressor gene promoter methylation (CDKN2A, CDH13, RASSF1, APC, MGMT, GSTP1, DAPK1, WIF1, and ADAMTS8) was not prognostic for early tumor recurrence in this prospective study of resected NSCLCs.",1.783,1894

Exfoliated cervical cells were used to measure methylation levels of the CADM1, MAL, and MIR124-2 genes using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Methylation levels were summarized as cycle threshold (Ct) ratios compared with the beta-actin gene. Median Ct ratios were compared across histological diagnoses, with 95% confidence intervals calculated by bootstrapping. Methylation levels at 6 months were assessed in 128 women who remained hrHPV positive. RESULTS: All 3 methylation markers showed significantly (P < 0.001) raised median Ct ratios in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 compared with women with a normal cervix.

When the test was calibrated to have similar specificity, sensitivity of the combined tri-marker test for CIN2+ was comparable with cytology [atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse] (89% and 95%, respectively) and superior to visual inspection with acetic acid (85% vs 70%) and HPV16/18 genotyping (65% vs 40%). Among women with no CIN2+ at baseline and persistent hrHPV at 6-month follow-up, MAL-m1 and MIR124-2 Ct ratios increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation markers in combination with HPV testing may offer a full molecular screening strategy to the many HIV-infected women who are also hrHPV positive.",0,12

In this study, we aimed to evaluate SRC, LYN and CKB protein and mRNA expression, as well as their promoter methylation, in gastric cancer. We found elevated expression of SRC and LYN kinase mRNA and protein but decreased levels of CKB kinase, alterations that may have a role in the invasiveness and metastasis of gastric tumors. Expression of the three studied kinases was also associated with MYC oncogene expression, a possible biomarker for gastric cancer. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the expression of these genes, we evaluated the DNA promoter methylation of the three kinases. We found that reduced SRC and LYN methylation and increased CKB methylation was associated with gastric cancer. The reduced SRC and LYN methylation was associated with increased levels of mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that DNA methylation is involved in regulating the expression of these kinases. Conversely, reduced CKB methylation was observed in samples with reduced mRNA and protein expression, suggesting CKB expression was found to be only partly regulated by DNA methylation. Additionally, we found that alterations in the DNA methylation pattern of the three studied kinases were also associated with the gastric cancer onset, advanced gastric cancer, deeper tumor invasion and the presence of metastasis. Therefore, SRC, LYN and CKB expression or DNA methylation could be useful markers for predicting tumor progression and targeting in anti-cancer strategies.",3.234,1198

METHODS: The LINE-1 methylation pattern from first trimester placenta, hydatidiform mole, and malignant trophoblast specimens were compared. Then, hydatidiform mole patients from 11999 to 2010 were classified into the following 2 groups: a remission group and a group that developed postmolar GTN. Specimens were prepared for a methylation study. The methylation levels and percentages of LINE-1 loci were evaluated for their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the prediction of postmolar GTN. RESULTS: First, 12 placentas, 38 moles, and 19 malignant trophoblast specimens were compared. The hydatidiform mole group had the highest LINE-1 methylation level (p = 0.003) and the (u)C(u)C of LINE-1 increased in the malignant trophoblast group (p </= 0.001). One hundred forty-five hydatidiform mole patients were classified as 103 remission and 42 postmolar GTN patients. The %(m)C(u)C and %(u)C(m)C of LINE-1 showed the lowest p value for distinguishing between the two groups (p < 0.001). The combination of the pretreatment beta-hCG level (>/=100,000 mIU/mL) with the %(m)C(u)C and %(u)C(m)C, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy modified the levels to 60.0%, 92.2%, 77.4%, 83.8%, and 82.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the partial methylation of LINE-1 occurs early before the clinical appearance of malignant transformation. The %(m)C(u)C and %(u)C(m)C of LINE-1s may be promising markers for monitoring hydatidiform moles before progression to GTN.",1.579,1648

METHODS: Illumina's (San Diego, CA, USA) DNA methylation 27-K assay was used to identify differentially methylated loci (DML). DNA methylation levels were validated by pyrosequencing. A discovery cohort of 15 patients with OSA and 6 healthy subjects, and a validation cohort of 72 patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 636 DMLs in patients with OSA versus healthy subjects, and 327 DMLs in patients with OSA and hypertension versus those without hypertension. In the validation cohort, no significant difference in DNA methylation levels of six selected genes was found between the primary snoring subjects and OSA patients (primary outcome). However, a secondary outcome analysis showed that interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL1R2) promoter methylation (-114 cytosine followed by guanine dinucleotide sequence [CpG] site) was decreased and IL1R2 protein levels were increased in the patients with SDB with an oxygen desaturation index > 30. Androgen receptor (AR) promoter methylation (-531 CpG site) and AR protein levels were both increased in the patients with SDB with an oxygen desaturation index > 30. Natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) promoter methylation (-608/-618 CpG sites) were decreased, whereas levels of both NPR2 and serum C type natriuretic peptide protein were increased in the SDB patients with EDS. Speckled protein 140 (SP140) promoter methylation (-194 CpG site) was increased, and SP140 protein levels were decreased in the patients with SDB and EDS. CONCLUSIONS: IL1R2 hypomethylation and AR hypermethylation may constitute an important determinant of disease severity, whereas NPR2 hypomethylation and SP140 hypermethylation may provide a biomarker for vulnerability to EDS in OSA.

The risk factors and functional consequences of p16(INK4a) methylation are unknown. Alcohol consumption, a breast cancer risk factor, impedes folate metabolism and may thereby alter gene methylation since folate plays a pivotal role in DNA methylation. In a cross-sectional study of 138 women with no history of breast cancer who underwent reduction mammoplasty, we studied breast cancer risk factors, plasma and breast folate concentrations, variation in one-carbon metabolism genes, p16(INK4a) promoter methylation and P16 protein expression. Logistic regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). p16(INK4a) methylation was negatively correlated with P16 expression (r = -0.28; P = 0.002). Alcohol consumption was associated with lower breast folate (P = 0.03), higher p16(INK4a) promoter methylation (P = 0.007) and less P16 expression (P = 0.002). Higher breast folate concentrations were associated with lower p16(INK4a) promoter methylation (P = 0.06). Genetic variation in MTRR (rs1801394) and MTHFD1 (rs1950902) was associated with higher p16 (INK4a) promoter methylation (OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.11-6.42 and OR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.12-6.66, respectively), whereas variation in TYMS (rs502396) was associated with less P16 protein expression (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.99). Given that this is the first study to indicate that alcohol consumption, breast folate and variation in one-carbon metabolism genes are associated with p16(INK4a) promoter methylation and P16 protein expression in healthy tissues; these findings require replication.",5.334,1178

DNA was isolated from PB samples at the time of -1, 1, and 7 days of chemotherapy. Global methylation was determined by ELISA, and the CpG island DNA methylation profile of 5 genes using a DNA methylation PCR system. Our data demonstrated that patients with a high level of 5-mC had a poor prognosis after demethylation therapy and those who have low levels of 5-mC in PB achieved higher CR and better SO, but there was no significant correlation found between the 5-mC levels and other clinical features before treatment except the disease status. Higher methylation status of Sox2 and Oct4 genes was associated with differential response to demethylation therapy. A relatively low methylation percentage in one or both of these two genes was also associated with longer OS after decitabine based chemotherapy. We also suggest that global DNA and Oct-4/Sox2 methylation might impact on the pathogenesis of leukemia and play an important role in the initiation and progression. Moreover, dynamic analysis of 5-mC and Oct-4/Sox2 in peripheral blood nucleated cells of leukemia patients may provide clues to important molecular diagnostic and prognostic targets.",0.257,1741

Post-translational modifications of HIF-1alpha and 2alpha are necessary to modulate their functions. The methylation of non-histone proteins by Set7, an SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase, is a novel regulatory mechanism to control cell protein function in response to various cellular stresses. In this study, we show that Set7 methylates HIF-1alpha at lysine 32 and HIF-2alpha at lysine K29; this methylation inhibits the expression of HIF-1alpha/2alpha targets by impairing the occupancy of HIF-alpha on hypoxia response element of HIF target gene promoter. Set7-null fibroblasts and the cells with shRNA-knocked down Set7 exhibit upregulated HIF target genes. Set7 inhibitor blocks HIF-1alpha/2alpha methylation to enhance HIF target gene expression. Set7-null fibroblasts and the cells with shRNA-knocked down Set7 or inhibition of Set7 by the inhibitor subjected to hypoxia display an increased glucose uptake and intracellular adenosine triphosphate levels. These findings define a novel modification of HIF-1alpha/2alpha and demonstrate that Set7-medited lysine methylation negatively regulates HIF-alpha transcriptional activity and HIF-1alpha-mediated glucose homeostasis.",9.112,346

Hence, DNA methylation profiling can capture pivotal features of gene expression in cancer tissues from patients at the time of diagnosis. In this work, we analyzed a breast cancer case series, to identify DNA methylation determinants of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors. METHODS: CpG-island methylation was evaluated on a 56-gene cancer-specific biomarker microarray in metastatic versus non-metastatic breast cancers in a multi-institutional case series of 123 breast cancer patients. Global statistical modeling and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were applied to identify a multi-gene binary classifier with high sensitivity and specificity. Network analysis was utilized to quantify the connectivity of the identified genes. RESULTS: Seven genes (BRCA1, DAPK1, MSH2, CDKN2A, PGR, PRKCDBP, RANKL) were found informative for prognosis of metastatic diffusion and were used to calculate classifier accuracy versus the entire data-set. Individual-gene performances showed sensitivities of 63-79 %, 53-84 % specificities, positive predictive values of 59-83 % and negative predictive values of 63-80 %. When modelled together, these seven genes reached a sensitivity of 93 %, 100 % specificity, a positive predictive value of 100 % and a negative predictive value of 93 %, with high statistical power. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering independently confirmed these findings, in close agreement with the accuracy measurements. Network analyses indicated tight interrelationship between the identified genes, suggesting this to be a functionally-coordinated module, linked to breast cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify CpG-island methylation profiles with deep impact on clinical outcome, paving the way for use as novel prognostic assays in clinical settings.",3.362,1552

MITF is regulated by multiple intracellular signaling pathways, although the exact mechanisms that determine MITF expression and activity remain incompletely understood. In this study, we obtained genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from 50 stage IV melanomas, normal melanocytes, keratinocytes, and dermal fibroblasts and utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas data for experimental validation. By integrating DNA methylation and gene expression data, we found that hypermethylation of MITF and its co-regulated differentiation pathway genes corresponded to decreased gene expression levels. In cell lines with a hypermethylated MITF-pathway, overexpression of MITF did not alter the expression level or methylation status of the MITF pathway genes. In contrast, however, demethylation treatment of these cell lines induced MITF-pathway activity, confirming that gene regulation was controlled via methylation. The discovery that the activity of the master regulator of pigmentation, MITF, and its downstream targets may be regulated by hypermethylation has significant implications for understanding the development and evolvement of melanoma.",0,1242

METHODS: Seventy-two healthy SD male rats were randomly assigned by weight into two parts and nine groups (eight rats/group). Exposure part included control group and low, medium and high dose aluminum maltolate group (0.27, 0.54 and 1.08 mg/kg alumium maltolate). Intervention part included control group, 1.08 mg/kg aluminum maltolate group, 1.08 mg/kg aluminum maltolate and low,medium and high dose folic acid group (0.7, 1.5 and. 3.4 mg/kg folic acid). Aluminum maltolate were subjected to peritoneal injection (0.2 ml/d) and folic acid were subjected to intragastric administration in 1 ml/100 g for 60 days. The learning and memory abilities were examined by using Morris water maze test and genome-wide methylation was determined via ELISA assay. RESULTS: It was revealed by Morris water maze test that target quadrant residence time and through the original position were markedly shortened as a result of medium and high dose aluminum exposure when compared with control group (both P < 0.05). The target quadrant residence time and through the original position were extended as a result of folic acid intervention when compared with 1.08 mg/kg aluminum maltolate exposure group. Both of them had statistical difference between 1.08 mg/kg aluminum maltolate and (1.5 mg/kg and 3.4 mg/kg) folic acid intervention group and 1.08 mg/kg aluminum maltolate exposure group (both P < 0.05). Considerable decrease in genome-wide methylation rate was associated with elevated dosage of aluminum maltolate (0.54 mg/kg and 1.08 mg/kg) as compared with control group (both P < 0.05). The genome-wide methylation rate was gradually increase as a result of high-dose folic acid intervention when compared with high-dose aluminum maltolate exposure group (both P < 0.05).

Recent results indicate that plants can remember a past exposure to stress to be better prepared for a future stress incident. However, the molecular basis of this is poorly understood. Here, we report the involvement of chromatin modifications in the maintenance of acquired thermotolerance (heat stress [HS] memory). HS memory is associated with the accumulation of histone H3 lysine 4 di- and trimethylation at memory-related loci. This accumulation outlasts their transcriptional activity and marks them as recently transcriptionally active. High accumulation of H3K4 methylation is associated with hyper-induction of gene expression upon a recurring HS. This transcriptional memory and the sustained accumulation of H3K4 methylation depend on HSFA2, a transcription factor that is required for HS memory, but not initial heat responses. Interestingly, HSFA2 associates with memory-related loci transiently during the early stages following HS. In summary, we show that transcriptional memory after HS is associated with sustained H3K4 hyper-methylation and depends on a hit-and-run transcription factor, thus providing a molecular framework for HS memory.",0,43

METHODS: The methylation of GSTP1 and RASSF1A was investigated by using the MSP in 50 prostate cancer and 17 benign prostate hyperplasia specimens. The MSP-DB assay that uses a single or multiple probes specifically detected the methylation status of a particular gene or of the two genes GSTP1 and RASSF1A at the same time in a series of samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the MSP-DB were compared to those of the MSP. RESULTS: The probes specifically hybridized with the methylated targets only in the MSP-DB, which allowed detecting GSTP1 and RASSF1A methylation in 23 of 50 and 14 of 50 patients with prostate cancer and in 2 of 17 and 4 of 17 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. MSP-DB following the MSP assay improved the sensitivity of detection to more than 0.01 % methylated status of a given high CpG-rich region. One methylated MSP product corresponding to the GSTP1, lack of methylated cytosine, was clearly detected on gel electrophoresis but barely visible on MSP-DB. Thus, the MSP-DB is suitable to eliminate the risk of false-positive results. CONCLUSION: The MSP-DB dispels the weakness of MSP and increases the sensitivity to simultaneous methylation analysis of multiple genes. The MSP-DB is advantageous for the promotion of DNA methylation markers in progressing quickly toward clinical application.",2.128,375

A combined study to probe the association between them provides a new perspective to understanding SZ. Genomic methylation of peripheral blood and regional brain volumes derived from magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed using parallel independent component analyses in this study. Nine methylation components and five brain volumetric components were extracted for 94 SZ patients and 106 healthy controls. After controlling for age, sex, race, and substance use, a component comprised primarily of bilateral cerebellar volumes was significantly correlated to a methylation component from 14 CpG sites in 13 genes. Both patients and healthy controls demonstrated similar associations, but patients had significantly smaller cerebellar volumes and dysmethylation in the associated epigenetic component compared to controls. The 13 genes are enriched in cellular growth and proliferation with some genes involved in neuronal growth and cerebellum development (GATA4, ADRA1D, EPHA3, and KCNK10), and these genes are prominently associated with neurological and psychological disorders. Such findings suggest that the methylation pattern of the genes coding for cellular growth may influence the cerebellar development through regulating gene expression, and the alteration in the methylation of these genes in SZ patients may contribute to the cerebellar volume reduction observed in patients.",3.923,1904

Although previous reports suggest that DE exposure affects the brain of offspring in the developmental period, the molecular events associated with the health effects have largely remained unclear. We hypothesized that the DNA methylation state would be disrupted by prenatal DE exposure. In the present study, the authors examined the genome-wide DNA methylation state of the gene promoter and bioinformatically analyzed the obtained data to identify the molecular events related to disrupted DNA methylation. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DE (DEP; 0.1 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) in an inhalation chamber on gestational days 0-16. Brains were collected from 1-day-old and 21-day-old offspring. The genomewide DNA methylation state of the brain genome was analyzed by methylation-specific DNA immunoprecipitation and subsequent promoter tiling array analysis. The genes in which the DNA methylation level was affected by prenatal DE exposure were bioinformatically categorized using Gene Ontology (GO). Differentially methylated DNA regions were detected in all chromosomes in brains collected from both 1-day-old and 21-day-old offspring. Altered DNA methylation was observed independently of the presence of CpG island. Bioinformatic interpretation using GO terms showed that differentially methylated genes with CpG islands in their promoter were commonly enriched in neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis. The results suggest that prenatal DE exposure causes genome-wide disruption of DNA methylation in the brain. Disrupted DNA methylation would disturb neuronal development in the developmental period and may be associated with health and disease in later life.",0,1020

Male Wistar rats were submitted to epithelial excision in the dorsal region and subsequently distributed within the experimental groups: group 1, animals that received irradiation of 0.8 J/cm2 of LED (604 nm); group 2, animals that received 1.6 J/cm2 of LED (604 nm); control (CTL), animals not submitted to therapeutic intervention. LED applications were performed during 7 days, and tissues from the periphery of the wound area were obtained for molecular analysis. The Image-J software was used for analysis of the wound area. DNA methylation was evaluated by ELISA-based method and gene expressions were quantified by real-time PCR. Decrease on global DNA methylation profile was observed in all experimental groups (CTL, 1, and 2) revealing the participation of DNA methylation in the healing process. Significant decrease in the wound area accompanied by increase in the Dnmt3a expression was associated to group 2. Based on our findings, we propose that DNA methylation is an important molecular mechanism associated to wound healing and that irradiation with 1.6 J/cm2 of LED evokes an increase in the expression of the Dnmt3a that might associates to the efficiency of the epithelial wound healing.",2.489,1671

The odds ratios (ORs) of eligible studies and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were used to correlate RASSF1A promoter methylation with renal cell cancer risk and clinical or pathological variables, respectively. RASSF1A promoter methylation was significantly associated with the risk of renal cell cancer (OR = 19.35, 95%CI = 9.57-39.13). RASSF1A promoter methylation was significantly associated with pathological tumor grade (OR = 3.32, 95%CI = 1.55-7.12), and a possible positive correlation between RASSF1A promoter methylation status and tumor stage was noted (OR = 1.89, 95%CI = 1.00-3.56, P = 0.051). Overall, this meta-analysis demonstrated that RASSF1A promoter methylation is significantly associated with increased risk of renal cell cancer.

There is evidence for the contribution of environmental factors, whose effect may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics involves the regulation of gene expression independently of DNA sequence and these epigenetic changes are influenced by age and environmental factors, with DNA methylation being one of the best characterized epigenetic mechanisms. The human genome is predominantly methylated on CpG motifs, which results in gene silencing; however methylation within the body of the gene may mark active transcription. There is evidence suggesting an involvement of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which prompted our study examining DNA methylation in this disorder. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry with 5-methylcytosine/5-hydroxymethylcytosine antibodies we studied, in comparison with age matched controls, DNA methylation in sporadic and familial AD cases in the entorhinal cortex that exhibits substantial pathology and the cerebellum, which is relatively spared. RESULTS: Neuronal nuclear labelling with 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was evident in all cases studied. We did not detect any significant change in the levels of nuclear staining in the AD samples compared to neurologically normal controls. In the entorhinal cortex we also examined global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Its performance was assessed in 312 control (CGG <40), 143 premutation (PM) (CGG 56-170), 197 full mutation (FM) (CGG 200-2000), and 33 CGG size and methylation mosaic samples. RESULTS: In male and female newborn blood spots, MS-QMA differentiated FM from control alleles, with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values between 92% and 100%. In venous blood of FM females between 6 and 35 years of age, MS-QMA correlated most strongly with verbal IQ impairment (P = 0.002). In the larger cohort of males and females, MS-QMA correlated with reference methods Southern blot and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (P < 0.05), but was not significantly correlated with age. Unmethylated alleles in high-functioning FM and PM males determined by both reference methods were also unmethylated by MS-QMA. CONCLUSIONS: MS-QMA has an immediate application in FXS diagnostics, with a potential use of its quantitative methylation output for prognosis in both sexes.",7.911,1097

In this study, we determine whether methylation changes of androgen biosynthesis pathway (ABP)-related genes in patients' plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can serve as prognostic markers for biochemical recurrence (BCR). METHODS: Methyl-binding domain capture sequencing (MBDCap-seq) was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in primary tumors of patients who subsequently developed BCR or not, respectively. Methylation pyrosequencing of candidate loci was validated in cfDNA samples of 86 PCa patients taken at and/or post-radical prostatectomy (RP) using univariate and multivariate prediction analyses. RESULTS: Putative DMRs in 13 of 30 ABP-related genes were found between tumors of BCR (n = 12) versus no evidence of disease (NED) (n = 15). In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data confirmed increased DNA methylation of two loci-SRD5A2 and CYP11A1, which also correlated with their decreased expression, in tumors with subsequent BCR development. Their aberrant cfDNA methylation was also associated with detectable levels of PSA taken after patients' post-RP. Multivariate analysis of the change in cfDNA methylation at all of CpG sites measured along with patient's treatment history predicted if a patient will develop BCR with 77.5% overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, increased DNA methylation of SRD5A2 and CYP11A1 related to androgen biosynthesis functions may play a role in BCR after patients' RP. The correlation between aberrant cfDNA methylation and detectable PSA in post-RP further suggests their utility as predictive markers for PCa recurrence. .",0,132

In the present study, we aim to explore the effects of BPA on epigenetic modification in rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus. We have detected the global and cyp19a1a gene specific DNA methylation in gonads of adult G. rarus under BPA exposure. The global DNA methylation level was significantly increased in testis of the male fish exposed to BPA for 7 days, and it was significantly increased in the ovary following 35-days exposure. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze the transfer of a methyl moiety from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the cytosine of a CpG dinucleotide. The alteration of the detected dnmts mRNA expression could affect the global DNA methylation levels following 15mug/L BPA exposure. Cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19A1A), is responsible for the conversion of androgens into estrogens, which plays a vital role in estrogen synthesis in gonads. In the present study, the methylation level of ovarian cyp19a1a gene was significantly suppressed and stimulated by 7- and 35-day BPA exposure, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between cyp19a1a mRNA expression and methylation levels of the four CpGs at the 5' flanking region in the ovary of adult G. rarus following BPA exposure. So we hypothesize that there are some association between the reproductive toxicity of BPA and the global DNA methylation under BPA exposure. And the alteration of cyp19a1a expression in female G. rarus by BPA might attribute to the change of its DNA methylation status.",3.451,1080

Here we generated seven mouse lines with different mutations in the IDD. Homozygous mutant mice of five lines developed normally, with normal levels of methylation on both imprinted and nonimprinted DNA sequences. The other two lines, however, had alterations in imprinted and/or nonimprinted (global) DNA methylation appearing during embryonic development. Embryos of one line expressing a DNMT1 variant containing a 6-aa rat orthologous sequence in the IDD maintained imprinted methylation, showed very reduced levels of global methylation and occasionally completed fetal development. These in vivo studies demonstrate that at least two DNMT1-dependent methylation processes can be distinguished during fetal development. One process maintains the bulk of genomic methylation on nonimprinted sequences. The other process maintains methylation on a much smaller class of sequences including but not limited to gametic differentially methylated domains (gDMDs) that transmit essential imprinted parent-specific methylation for embryonic development.",5.963,661

In total, twelve primiparous LandracexYorkshire gilts were fed rations providing either 100 % (control (CON)) or 75 % (undernutrition (UN)) nutritional requirements according to the National Research Council recommendations, throughout gestation. Muscle samples of offspring were collected at birth (dpn1), weaning (dpn28) and adulthood (dpn189). Compared with CON pigs, UN pigs showed lower serum glucose concentrations at birth, but showed higher serum glucose and insulin concentrations as well as increased area under the blood glucose curve during intravenous glucose tolerance test at dpn189 (P<0.05). Compared with CON pigs, GLUT-4 gene and protein expressions were decreased at dpn1 and dpn189 in the muscle of UN pigs, which was accompanied by increased methylation at the GLUT4 promoter (P<0.05). These alterations in methylation concurred with increased mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 at dpn1 and dpn28, DNMT3a at dpn189 and DNMT3b at dpn1 in UN pigs compared with CON pigs (P<0.05). Interestingly, although the average methylation levels at the muscle GLUT4 promoter were decreased at dpn189 compared with dpn1 in pigs exposed to a poor maternal diet (P<0.05), the methylation differences in individual CpG sites were more pronounced with age. Our results indicate that in utero undernutrition persists to silence muscle GLUT4 likely through DNA methylation during the ageing process, which may lead to the amplification of age-associated glucose intolerance.",0,1434

However, little is known about the associated regulatory mechanisms at the epigenetic level in maize under lead (Pb) stress. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare DNA methylation profiles during the dynamic development of maize roots following Pb treatment to identify candidate genes involved in the response to Pb stress. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was used to investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in maize roots under normal condition (A1) and 3 mM Pb(NO3)2 stress for 12 h (K2), 24 h (K3) and 48 h (K4). The results showed that the average methylation density was the highest in CpG islands (CGIs), followed by the intergenic regions. Within the gene body, the methylation density of the introns was higher than those of the UTRs and exons. In total, 3857 methylated genes were found in 4 tested samples, including 1805 differentially methylated genes for K2 versus A1, 1508 for K3 versus A1, and 1660 for K4 versus A1. Further analysis showed that 140 genes exhibited altered DNA methylation in all three comparisons, including some well-known stress-responsive transcription factors and proteins, such as MYB, AP2/ERF, bZIP, serine-threonine/tyrosine-proteins, pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, RING zinc finger proteins, F-box proteins, leucine-rich repeat proteins and tetratricopeptide repeat proteins.

The highest risk is associated with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes, including HLA-DQA1 gene. Our aim was to investigate DNA methylation of HLA-DQA1 promoter alleles (QAP) and correlate methylation status with individual HLA-DQA1 allele expression of patients with T1D and healthy controls. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression and is known to be shaped by the environment.Sixty one patients with T1D and 39 healthy controls were involved in this study. Isolated DNA was treated with sodium bisulphite and HLA-DQA1 promoter sequence was amplified using nested PCR. After sequencing, DNA methylation of HLA-DQA1 promoter alleles was analysed. Individual mRNA HLA-DQA1 relative allele expression was assessed using two different endogenous controls (PPIA, DRA). We have found statistically significant differences in HLA-DQA1 allele 02:01 expression (PPIA normalization, Pcorr = 0.041; DRA normalization, Pcorr = 0.052) between healthy controls and patients with T1D. The complete methylation profile of the HLA-DQA1 promoter was gained with the most methylated allele DQA1*02:01 and the least methylated DQA1*05:01 in both studied groups. Methylation profile observed in patients with T1D and healthy controls was similar, and no correlation between HLA-DQA1 allele expression and DNA methylation was found.

METHODS: In this study, genome-wide methylation and expression analyses were performed on cerebellum samples from 39 patients with schizophrenia, 36 patients with bipolar disorder, and 43 unaffected controls, to screen for a correlation between gene expression and CpG methylation. RESULTS: Out of 71,753 CpG gene pairs (CGPs) tested across the genome, 204 were found to significantly correlate with gene expression after correction for multiple testing [p < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05]. The correlated CGPs were tested for disease-associated expression and methylation by comparing psychotic patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to healthy controls.

Conversely, cross-sectional analyses of healthier lifestyle patterns have been associated with higher levels of global DNA methylation. OBJECTIVE: In this trial, we explored the associations between changes in lifestyle modifications (diet, weight loss), metabolic markers, and global epigenetic biomarkers in white blood cells. METHODS: Study participants were Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean overweight and sedentary female breast cancer survivors (n = 24) who participated in a larger randomized, crossover, pilot study of a 6-mo weight loss intervention and who had available blood specimens. Anthropometric measures, a food-frequency questionnaire, and peripheral blood were collected at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. Plasma samples were analyzed for metabolic markers (insulin, glucose). We measured DNA methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) and satellite 2 by pyrosequencing and MethyLight, respectively, and global DNA methylation by the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA). RESULTS: DNA methylation of LINE-1 was statistically significantly elevated at 6 mo [75.5% vs. 78.5% (P < 0.0001)] and 12 mo [75.5% vs. 77.7% (P < 0.0001)], compared to baseline. Over a 12-mo period, changes in percentage body fat and plasma glucose concentrations were positively associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation (beta = 0.19, P = 0.001) and LUMA DNA methylation levels (beta = 0.24, P = 0.02), respectively.

We hypothesized that the methylation status of SOCS1, SOCS3, and long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1 in gingival tissues previously inflamed would be similar to that found in gingival tissues without clinical inflammation in the period studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laser capture microdissection was performed to isolate epithelial and connective gingival tissues. The groups were comprised by ten patients without history of periodontitis and absence of clinical signs of inflammation in the gingiva during the study (healthy group) and ten patients with history of periodontitis, presenting inflammation in the gingival tissue at the first examination of the study (controlled chronic periodontitis group). The gingival biopsies from the controlled chronic periodontitis group were collected after controlling the inflammation. DNA methylation patterns were analyzed using methylation-specific high-resolution melting and combined bisulfite restriction analysis. RESULTS: DNA methylation levels for SOCS1 and SOCS3 did not differ between groups or tissues; likewise, no differences were observed in total LINE-1 methylation or at specific loci. CONCLUSION: At 3 months following control of inflammation in gingival tissues, the methylation profile of SOCS1, SOCS3, and LINE-1 is similar between connective and epithelial tissues from patients that were previously affected or not by chronic inflammation.

The results showed that the region from -90 to -43 in the 5'-flanking region of Piwil1 contains a transcriptional regulatory CCAAT box that was necessary for the transcriptional activity of the Piwil1 promoter. Moreover, the transcription factor nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) was bound to the Piwil1 promoter CCAAT box specifically in germ cells. In addition, bisulfite sequencing to determine the methylation profile of the Piwil1 promoter CpG island in different spermatogenic and non-germ cell populations was performed. Compared with germ cells, non-germ cells showed increased methylation of the promoter region containing the CCAAT box, loss of NF-Y binding, and silencing of the Piwil1 locus.

One unanswered question is whether DNA methylation could be involved in local adaptation of plant populations to their environments. If methylation alters phenotypes to improve plant response to the environment, then methylation sites or the genes that affect them could be a target of natural selection. Using reduced-representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) data, we assessed whether climate is associated with variation in DNA methylation levels among 58 naturally occurring, and species-wide samples of valley oak (Quercus lobata) collected across climate gradients. We identified the genomic context of these variants referencing a new draft valley oak genome sequence. Methylation data were obtained for 341 107 cytosines, of which we deemed 57 488 as single-methylation variants (SMVs), found in the CG, CHG and CHH sequence contexts. Environmental association analyses revealed 43 specific SMVs that are significantly associated with any of four climate variables, the majority of which are associated with mean maximum temperature. The 43 climate-associated SMVs tend to occur in or near genes, several of which have known involvement in plant response to environment. Multivariate analyses show that climate and spatial variables explain more overall variance in CG-SMVs among individuals than in SNPs, CHG-SMVs or CHH-SMVs. Together, these results from natural oak populations provide initial evidence for a role of CG methylation in locally adaptive evolution or plasticity in plant response.",6.494,872

However, acquisition of sufficient chilling during winter dormancy ensures the normal phenological traits in subsequent growing period. Thus, low temperature appears to play crucial roles in growth and development of temperate plants. Apple, being an important temperate fruit crop, also requires sufficient chilling to release winter dormancy and normal phenological traits, which are often associated with yield and quality of fruits. DNA cytosine methylation is one of the important epigenetic modifications which remarkably affect the gene expression during various developmental and adaptive processes. In present study, methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism was employed to assess the changes in cytosine methylation during dormancy, active growth and fruit set in apple, under differential chilling conditions. Under high chill conditions, total methylation was decreased from 27.2% in dormant bud to 21.0% in fruit set stage, while no significant reduction was found under low chill conditions. Moreover, the demethylation was found to be decreased, while methylation increased from dormant bud to fruit set stage under low chill as compared to high chill conditions. In addition, RNA-Seq analysis showed high expression of DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases during dormancy and fruit set, and low expression of DNA glcosylases during active growth under low chill conditions, which was in accordance with changes in methylation patterns. The RNA-Seq data of 47 genes associated with MSAP fragments involved in cellular metabolism, stress response, antioxidant system and transcriptional regulation showed correlation between methylation and their expression. Similarly, bisulfite sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes also showed correlation between gene body methylation and gene expression. Moreover, significant association between chilling and methylation changes was observed, which suggested that chilling acquisition during dormancy in apple is likely to affect the epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation.",3.234,145

FPGS-induced polyglutamylated folates are better substrates for several enzymes involved in the generation of S-adenosylmethionine, the primary methyl group donor, and hence FPGS modulation may affect DNA methylation. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic determinant in gene expression and aberrant DNA methylation is mechanistically linked cancer development. We investigated whether FPGS modulation would affect global and gene-specific promoter DNA methylation with consequent functional effects on gene expression profiles in HCT116 colon and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. Although FPGS modulation altered global DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) activity, the effects of FPGS modulation on global DNA methylation and DNMT activity could not be solely explained by intracellular folate concentrations and content of long-chain folylpolyglutamates, and it may be cell-specific. FPGS modulation influenced differential gene expression and promoter cytosine-guanine dinucleotide sequences (CpG) DNA methylation involved in cellular development, cell cycle, cell death and molecular transport. Some of the altered gene expression was associated with promoter CpG DNA methylation changes. In both the FPGS-overexpressed HCT116 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines, we identified several differentially expressed genes involved in folate biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism, which might in part have contributed to the observed increased efficacy of 5-fluorouracil in response to FPGS overexpression. Our data suggest that FPGS modulation affects global and promoter CpG DNA methylation and expression of several genes involved in important biological pathways. The potential role of FPGS modulation in DNA methylation and its associated downstream functional effects warrants further studies.",0,963

In the postgenomic era, many types of -omic (e.g., transcriptomic, epigenomic, methylomic, and proteomic) data are becoming increasingly available. Therefore, evaluating the utility of this massive amount of information in prediction of complex traits is of interest. DNA methylation, the covalent change of a DNA molecule without affecting its underlying sequence, is one quantifiable form of epigenetic modification. We used methylation information for predicting plant height (PH) in Arabidopsis thaliana nonparametrically, using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression. Also, we used different criteria for selecting smaller sets of probes, to assess how representative probes could be used in prediction instead of using all probes, which may lessen computational burden and lower experimental costs. Methylation information was used for describing epigenetic similarities between individuals through a kernel matrix, and the performance of predicting PH using this similarity matrix was reasonably good. The predictive correlation reached 0.53 and the same value was attained when only preselected probes were used for prediction. We created a kernel that mimics the genomic relationship matrix in genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP) and estimated that, in this particular data set, epigenetic variation accounted for 65% of the phenotypic variance. Our results suggest that methylation information can be useful in whole-genome prediction of complex traits and that it may help to enhance understanding of complex traits when epigenetics is under examination.",5.963,482

The DNA regions studied were promoters (BRCA1, CD44, ESR1, GSTM2, GSTP1, MAGEA1, MSI1, NFE2L3, RASSF1A, RUNX3, SIX3 and TFF1), far-upstream regions (EN1, PAX3, PITX2, and SGK1), introns (APC, EGFR, LHX2, RFX1 and SOX9) and the LINE-1 and satellite 2 DNA repeats. These choices were based upon previous literature or publicly available DNA methylome profiles. The percent methylation was averaged across neighboring CpG sites. RESULTS: Most of the assayed gene regions displayed hypermethylation in cancer vs. adjacent tissue but the TFF1 and MAGEA1 regions were significantly hypomethylated (p </=0.001). Importantly, six of the 16 regions examined in a large collection of patients (105 - 129) and in 15-18 reduction mammoplasty samples were already aberrantly methylated in adjacent, histologically normal tissue vs. non-cancerous mammoplasty samples (p </=0.01). In addition, examination of transcriptome and DNA methylation databases indicated that methylation at three non-promoter regions (far-upstream EN1 and PITX2 and intronic LHX2) was associated with higher gene expression, unlike the inverse associations between cancer DNA hypermethylation and cancer-altered gene expression usually reported. These three non-promoter regions also exhibited normal tissue-specific hypermethylation positively associated with differentiation-related gene expression (in muscle progenitor cells vs. many other types of normal cells). The importance of considering the exact DNA region analyzed and the gene structure was further illustrated by bioinformatic analysis of an alternative promoter/intron gene region for APC. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the frequent DNA methylation changes in invasive breast cancer at a variety of genome locations and found evidence for an extensive field effect in breast cancer. In addition, we illustrate the power of combining publicly available whole-genome databases with a candidate gene approach to study cancer epigenetics.",3.362,401

The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of PCDH10 in serum of prostate cancer patients and its potential relevance to clinicopathological features and prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The methylation status of PCDH10 in serum of 171 primary prostate cancer patients and 65 controls was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), after which the relationship between PCDH10 methylation and clinicopathologic features was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between PCDH10 methylation and prognosis. RESULTS PCDH10 methylation occurred frequently in serum of prostate cancer patients. Moreover, PCDH10 methylation was significantly associated with higher preoperative PSA level, advanced clinical stage, higher Gleason score, lymph node metastasis, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). In addition, patients with methylated PCDH10 had shorter BCR-free survival and overall survival than patients with unmethylated PCDH10. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis indicated that PCDH10 methylation in serum is an independent predictor of worse BCR-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS PCDH10 methylation in serum is a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.",1.433,1567

This study comprised a total of 30 paranoid (15 males and 15 females) and 29 undifferentiated (15 males and 14 females) SCZ patients and 26 age- and gender-matched controls. Our results showed a significant association of CpG2 with SCZ. A breakdown analysis by gender showed that CpG2 and CpG3 methylation were significantly higher in male patients than male controls, and that CpG5 methylation was significantly higher in female patients than female controls. A further breakdown analysis by both gender and SCZ subtype showed that CpG2 and CpG3 methylation were significantly higher in male paranoid SCZ and male undifferentiated SCZ than male controls. In contrast, CpG2 and CpG3 methylation were significantly lower in female undifferentiated SCZ than female controls. Additionally, CpG5 methylation was significantly higher in female paranoid SCZ than female controls. In conclusion, our findings supported that DRD3 gene body hypermethylation was significantly associated with the risk of SCZ. Future study is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which DRD3 gene body hypermethylation contributes to the risk of SCZ.",2.467,169

The mechanisms underlying DNA methylation establishment remain poorly understood, but a number of post-translational modifications of histones are implicated in antagonizing or recruiting the de novo DNA methylation complex. In mouse oogenesis, DNA methylation establishment occurs on a largely unmethylated genome and in nondividing cells, making it a highly informative model for examining how histone modifications can shape the DNA methylome. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genome-wide sequencing (ChIP-seq) protocol optimized for low cell numbers and novel techniques for isolating primary and growing oocytes, profiles were generated for histone modifications implicated in promoting or inhibiting DNA methylation. CGIs destined for DNA methylation show reduced protective H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) and trimethylation (H3K4me3) in both primary and growing oocytes, while permissive H3K36me3 increases specifically at these CGIs in growing oocytes. Methylome profiling of oocytes deficient in H3K4 demethylase KDM1A or KDM1B indicated that removal of H3K4 methylation is necessary for proper methylation establishment at CGIs. This work represents the first systematic study performing ChIP-seq in oocytes and shows that histone remodeling in the mammalian oocyte helps direct de novo DNA methylation events.",10.798,113

Previously, we observed population differences in cytosine modifications between Caucasian and African lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) on the autosomes using whole genome arrays to measure modified cytosines. DNA methylation plays a critical role in establishment and maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation in females. Therefore, we reasoned that by investigating cytosine modification patterns specifically on the X-chromosome, we could obtain valuable information about a chromosome that is often disregarded in genome-wide analyses. We investigated population differences in cytosine modification patterns along the X-chromosome between Caucasian and African LCLs and identified novel sites that escape methylation on the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) in females. We characterized the chromatin state of these loci by incorporating the extensive histone modification ChIP-seq data generated by ENCODE. To explore the relationship between DNA and histone modifications further, we hypothesized that BRD4, a protein that binds acetylated histones, could be preventing some sites from becoming de novo methylated. To test this, we treated 4 female LCLs with JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of BRD4, but found that JQ1 treatment induced minor changes in cytosine modification levels, and the majority of sites escaping methylation on the Xi remained unmethylated. This suggests that other epigenetic mechanisms or transcription factors are likely playing a larger role in protecting these sites from de novo methylation on the Xi.",4.78,1768

We detected 1.5 million methylcytosines, and estimated the methylation levels for 24 035 genes. We found that many cytosine sites were methylated de novo from the meristem to the early flower stage, and many sites were demethylated from early to late flowers. A comparison of the transcriptome data of the same three periods revealed that the methylation and demethylation processes were correlated with expression changes of >3000 genes, many of which are important for normal flower development.

The exact role of methylation in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. However, aberrations (e.g. loss-/gain-of-function or up-/down-regulation) in components of epigenetic transcriptional regulation in general, and of the methylation machinery in particular, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition, many of these components have been identified as therapeutic targets for patients with MDS/AML, and are also being assessed as potential biomarkers of response or resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs). The HMAs 5-azacitidine (AZA) and 2'-deoxy-5-azacitidine (decitabine, DAC) inhibit DNA methylation and have shown significant clinical benefits in patients with myeloid malignancies. Despite being viewed as mechanistically similar drugs, AZA and DAC have differing mechanisms of action. DAC is incorporated 100% into DNA, whereas AZA is incorporated into RNA (80-90%) as well as DNA (10-20%). As such, both drugs inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs; dependently or independently of DNA replication) resulting in the re-expression of tumor-suppressor genes; however, AZA also has an impact on mRNA and protein metabolism via its inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in apoptosis. Herein, we first give an overview of transcriptional regulation, including DNA methylation, post-translational histone-tail modifications, the role of micro-RNA and long-range epigenetic gene silencing. We place special emphasis on epigenetic transcriptional regulation and discuss the implication of various components in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML, their potential as therapeutic targets, and their therapeutic modulation by HMAs and other substances (if known). The main focus of this review is laid on dissecting the rapidly evolving knowledge of AZA and DAC with a special focus on their differing mechanisms of action, and the effect of HMAs on transcriptional regulation.",5.356,653

To address inconsistencies in evidence regarding O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation as a potential prognostic factor in CRC, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate MGMT methylation in CRC patients. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis after screening 120 articles. The following items were collected from each study: author, published year, country, patient gender, MGMT methylation status, and patients' disease progression. Pooled hazard ratios and odd ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random effect models depending on the heterogeneity between studies. The overall survival of CRC patients was found not to be significantly associated with MGMT methylation. Further subgroup analysis showed that the frequency of MGMT methylation was significantly higher in CRC than in normal tissues (p < 0.00001). MGMT promoter in CRC patients was more frequently methylated than in adenoma patients. In addition, MGMT methylation was significantly increased in adenoma than in normal tissues (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, MGMT methylation is central to the development of cancer that involves a stepwise carcinogenesis of normal adenoma carcinoma cascade.

Differentially methylated loci were validated by bisulfite sequencing PCR, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of candidate genes were evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR. We found 224 genes that showed differential DNA methylation between epileptic patients and controls. Among the seven candidate genes, three genes (TUBB2B, ATPGD1, and HTR6) showed relative transcriptional regulation by DNA methylation. TUBB2B and ATPGD1 exhibited hypermethylation and decreased mRNA levels, whereas HTR6 displayed hypomethylation and increased mRNA levels in the epileptic samples.

We qualified the in situ specific methylation/demethylation rate constants in rice paddy soil during a complete rice-growing season. Our results demonstrate that MeHg levels in rice paddy soil were a function of both methylation and demethylation processes and the net methylation potential in the rice paddy soil reflected the measured MeHg production at any time point. Sulfate stimulating the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was a potentially important metabolic pathway for Hg methylation in rice paddies.

Changes in the main static properties (energy, structure, atomic charges) and dynamics (movement of hydrogen atoms from one base to the other) have been considered and analyzed. The results of this study support the idea that the quantitative effects of the methylation of these complexes depend on the specific system under consideration and on the H-bridge studied. In any case, some general behavior can be highlighted. In particular, the relationship between the transfer of hydrogen atoms between the bases (with the possible generation of mutation points) and the methylation can be schematized in the two most important methylated bases: adenine and cytosine. A different behavior has been found in these two cases, and we suggest that this could be related to the different amounts of these methylated systems in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In particular, this different behavior could explain why adenine methylation is present mainly in the bacteria and cytosine methylation is present in more complex organisms.",0,1421

However, its associations with mRNA expression and clinicopathological characteristics have not been evaluated. In this study, we explored the potential clinical implications of TRIM58 methylation in HCC. We analyzed the methylation level of TRIM58 in 181 HCC tissues, 172 matched adjacent non-tumor tissues and 13 normal liver tissues using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme based quantitative PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Further, the mRNA expression level of TRIM58 was measured in 46 paired HCC and adjacent non-tumor tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, the relationship between TRIM58 methylation and mRNA expression, the clinicopathological features, as well as prognostic value were evaluated. The results showed that TRIM58 methylation was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal liver tissues (both p<0.0001). Using 10% as the cut-off value, hypermethylation of TRIM58 was specific in HCC tissues (28.18%, 51/181), with a tendency to correlate with unfavorable disease-free survival (p=0.047). Moreover, TRIM58 expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.0001), and showed a negative association with DNA methylation (p=0.015, rs= -0.260). Our data indicate that TRIM58 methylation is a common event in HCC and may contribute to downregulation of its mRNA expression. Furthermore, hypermethylation of TRIM58 tends to be associated with worse DFS after hepatectomy. However, the potential clinical application of TRIM58 need to be further investigated.",2.301,802

Here we provide evidence suggesting that the global methylation level reported by LUMA is affected by the integrity of the DNA being analyzed. The less intact the DNA, the lower the global methylation levels reported by LUMA. In order to overcome this problem, we propose the use of undigested DNA alongside digested samples.

We identify the dimethylation of R584, R618, R620, R645, and R656, as well as the monomethylation of R661 R685 and R690 within hnRNPUL1 in U2OS cells by mass spectrometry.

Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that hnRNPUL1(RK) had impaired ability to associate with the DNA damage protein NBS1. Moreover, hnRNPUL1(RK) was not recruited to sites of DNA damage, unlike wild type hnRNPUL1, in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors.

METHODS: We performed a thorough analysis of alpha-synuclein methylation in bisulfite-treated DNA from peripheral blood of 490 sporadic PD patients and 485 healthy controls and in addition analyzed the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) on alpha-synuclein methylation and expression in cultured mononuclear cells. RESULTS: alpha-Synuclein was hypomethylated in sporadic PD patients, correlated with sex, age, and a polymorphism in the analyzed sequence stretch (rs3756063). alpha-Synuclein methylation separated healthy individuals from sporadic PD with a specificity of 74% (male) and 78% (female), respectively. alpha-Synuclein methylation was increased in sporadic PD patients with higher l-dopa dosage, and L-dopa specifically induced methylation of alpha-synuclein intron 1 in cultured mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-Synuclein methylation levels depended on disease status, sex, age, and the genotype of rs3756063. The pharmacological action of L-dopa was not limited to the dopamine precursor function but included epigenetic off-target effects. The hypomethylation of alpha-synuclein in sporadic PD patients' blood already observed in previous studies was probably underestimated because of effect of L-dopa, which was not known previously. The analysis of alpha-synuclein methylation can help to identify nonparkinsonian individuals with reasonable specificity, which offers a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians.",5.68,1562

METHODS: One hundred twenty nine healthy pregnant women were recruited between April 2011 and March 2012. Baseline data were collected with self-report questionnaires. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine the expression of IGF-1 mRNA in the placenta. Methylation level of the IGF 1 gene was determined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The expression of IGF-1 in placenta and its methylation level showed no significant difference between macrosomic fetuses and controls. No linear correlation was found between IGF-1 mRNA expression and methylation level of IGF-1 promoter (r=0.128, P=0.295). IGF-1 promoter region in placenta showed a hypomethylation status. However, a positive correlation was found between IGF-1 expression and birth weight below 4260 g (r=0.264, P=0.022). The expression of IGF-1 mRNA was significantly higher in those with a birth weight below 4260 g, which suggested that placental IGF-1 expression may contribute to increased birth weight. In regard to fetal overgrowth, however, there seemed to be a negative correlation in which placental IGF-1 expression was downregulated to limit fetal overgrowth. CONCLUSION: No linear correlation was found between placental IGF-1 expression and methylation level of IGF-1 promoter with a hypomethylation status. The contribution of placental IGF-1 expression to birth weight is bidirectional. Increased expression seems to promote fetal growth, while decreased expressions may curb overgrowth, therefore control fetal growth in a relatively normal range.",0,1984

CCK-8 and single cell gel electrophoresis assay were chosen to detect the cellular biological damage. MALDI-TOF-MS was used to detect the methylation levels of p16 and TP53. qRT-PCR was used to measure their expression levels in different Cr(VI) treatment groups. The transcription factors with target sequences of p16 and TP53 were predicted using various bioinformatics software. The findings showed that the cellular toxicity and DNA strand damage were Cr(VI) concentration dependent. The hypermethylation of CpG1, CpG31 and CpG32 of p16 was observed in Cr(VI) treated groups. There was significant positive correlation between the CpG1 methylation level of p16 and cell damage. In Cr(VI) treated groups, the expression level of p16 was lower than that in control group. The expression level of TP53 increased when the Cr(VI)concentration above 5muM. About p16, there was significant negative correlation between the CpG1 methylation levels with its expression level. A lot of binding sites for transcription factors existed in our focused CpG islands of p16.

The transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in adipocyte differentiation has been extensively studied, however the mechanisms driving the transcription activation are still poorly understood. In this study we explored the involvement of DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation during adipocyte differentiation of primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Genome-wide changes in DNA methylation were measured using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. In addition, expression of 84 adipogenic genes was determined, of which 43 genes showed significant expression changes during the differentiation process. Among these 43 differentially expressed genes, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected in only 3 genes. By comparing genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in undifferentiated and differentiated adipocytes 793 significant DMRs were detected. Pathway analysis revealed the adipogenesis pathway as the most statistically significant, although only a small number of genes were differentially methylated. Genome-wide DNA methylation changes for single probes were most often located in intergenic regions, and underrepresented close to the transcription start site. In conclusion, DNA methylation remained relatively stable during adipocyte differentiation, implying that changes in DNA methylation are not the underlying mechanism regulating gene expression during adipocyte differentiation.

However, even within the each group, there is heterogeneity in survival time. Here, we test the hypothesis that specific candidate gene methylation markers (CCNA1, NDN, CD1A, DCC, p16, GADD45A) are associated with tumor recurrence and survival, in a well-characterized, prospective, cohort of 346 HNSCC patients. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival time distributions. Multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to test associations between each methylation marker and OST/RPFT after adjusting for known or identified prognostic factors. Stratified Cox models included an interaction term between HPV and methylation marker to test for differences in the associations of the biomarker with OST or RPFT across HPV status. RESULTS: Methylation markers were differentially associated with patient characteristics. DNA hypermethylation of NDN and CD1A was found to be significantly associated with overall survival time (OST) in all HNSCC patients (NDN hazard ratio (HR): 2.35, 95% CI: 1.40-3.94; CD1A HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.71). Stratification by HPV status revealed hypermethylation of CD1A was associated with better OST and recurrence/persistence-free time (RPFT) (OST HR: 3.34, 95% CI: 1.88-5.93; RPFT HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.21-3.49), while hypomethylation of CCNA1 was associated with increased RPFT in HPV (+) patients only (HR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.13-0.74).

As intellectual disability is also a feature of various imprinting disorders and some monogenic forms of intellectual disability are caused by epigenetic modifiers we hypothesized that changes in DNA methylation might be associated with or even causative in some cases of intellectual disability. Therefore, we performed a DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood samples from 82 patients with intellectual disability and additional features using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The findings were compared to that of 19 normal controls. Differentially methylated loci were validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing. On a global level, we failed to detect a robust DNA methylation signature segregating individuals with intellectual disability from controls. Using an individual approach, we identified 157 regions showing individual DNA methylation changes in at least one patient. These correlated to 107 genes including genes linked to conditions associated with intellectual disability, namely COLEC11, SHANK2, GLI2 and KCNQ2, as well as imprinted genes like FAM50B and MEG3. The latter was suggestive of an undiagnosed Temple syndrome which could be confirmed by diagnostic tests. Subsequent in-depth analysis of imprinted loci revealed DNA methylation changes at additional imprinted loci, i.e. PPIEL, IGF2R, MEG8 and MCTS2/HM13, in up to five patients.

To investigate the roles of DNA methylation in fungal development, we profiled genome-wide methylation patterns at single-nucleotide resolution during vegetative growth, asexual reproduction, and infection-related morphogenesis in a model plant pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. We found that DNA methylation occurs in and around genes as well as transposable elements and undergoes global reprogramming during fungal development. Such reprogramming of DNA methylation suggests that it may have acquired new roles other than controlling the proliferation of TEs. Genetic analysis of DNA methyltransferase deletion mutants also indicated that proper reprogramming in methylomes is required for asexual reproduction in the fungus. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing of transposable elements and transcript abundance of genes in context-dependent manner, reinforcing the role of DNA methylation as a genome defense mechanism. This comprehensive approach suggests that DNA methylation in fungi can be a dynamic epigenetic entity contributing to fungal development and genome defense. Furthermore, our DNA methylomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in fungal development and pathogenesis.",5.578,1043

In this study, an improved gene promoter methylation assay based on fluorescence polarization in 5'-nuclease reaction was developed. The novel assay offered a homogeneous annealing and cleavage reaction fully integrated with PCR which used a probe labeled with fluorescence without quencher to obtain the decreased fluorescence polarization values. In this platform, gene promoter methylated and unmethylated alleles were detected simultaneously in a tube. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene promoter methylation in 103 glioma tissue samples and epidermal growth factor receptor gene promoter methylation in 116 primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma tissue samples were detected by the novel assay and sequencing, absolute quantitative analysis of methylated allele in parallel. The accuracy of the results measured by the improved fluorescence polarization assay was evaluated using the paired-samples t test. No significant difference was found ( P>0.05). Therefore, the improved fluorescence polarization assay in 5'-nuclease reaction demonstrated a homogeneous, reliable and cost-effective method for gene promoter methylation analysis in clinic. That would provide a scientific basis for applying a reasonable therapeutic regimen in future treatment.",2.871,297

Methylation status of hMLH1 was examined by nested methylation-specific PCR (nested MSP) in 84 archived NSCLC surgically resected tissue specimens from patients receiving cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to investigate the relationship between hMLH1 methylation status and the clinical prognosis of the patients mentioned above. In the cohort of 84 NSCLC cases, 80 tissue samples were successfully amplified by nested MSP. Among them, 36 samples (45%) were identified to be methylated. Moreover, hMLH1 methylation was not associated with age, gender, smoking status, T stage, histology and differentiation, but correlated with lymphatic metastasis (P=0.021). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hMLH1 methylation may function as a significant independent prognostic factor for tumor recurrence in NSCLC patients treated with adjuvant cisplatin (HR 3.114, 95% CI 1.032-9.399; P=0.044). However, Kaplan-Meier method (P=0.093) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (P=0.598) revealed that hMLH1 methylation was not associated with the survival of these patients. To conclude, the cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy is more beneficial for NSCLC patients without hMLH1 methylation. hMLH1 methylation may have a potential to become a biomarker of individualized therapy for NSCLC patients.",1.891,1154

Previously considered hallmarks of, respectively, constitutive and facultative heterochromatin, recent evidence has accumulated in favor of coexistence of these two marks and their cooperation in gene silencing maintenance. H3K9me2/3 ensures anchorage at chromatin of heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha), a main component of heterochromatin. HP1alpha chromoshadow domain, involved in dimerization and interaction with partners, has additional but still unclear roles in HP1alpha recruitment to chromatin. Because of previously suggested links between polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes H3K27 methylation, and HP1alpha, we tested whether PRC2 may regulate HP1alpha abundance at chromatin. We found that the EZH2 and SUZ12 subunits of PRC2 are required for HP1alpha stability, as knockdown of either protein led to HP1alpha degradation. Similar results were obtained upon overexpression of H3K27me2/3 demethylases. We further showed that binding of HP1alpha/beta/gamma to H3K9me3 peptides is greatly increased in the presence of H3K27me3, and this is dependent on PRC2. These data fit with recent proteomic studies identifying PRC2 as an indirect H3K9me3 binder in mouse tissues and suggest the existence of a cooperative mechanism of HP1alpha anchorage at chromatin involving H3 methylation on both K9 and K27 residues.",4.777,1869

How these polymorphisms interact with environmental factors to trigger T1D is unknown, but recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms could play a role. To begin to explore the contribution of epigenetics to T1D, we have examined DNA methylation in a pilot study of whole blood cells DNA from 10 young T1D patients and 10 young controls. Through the study of >900 000 CG loci across a diverse set of functionally relevant genomic regions using a custom DNA methylation array, we identified 250 T1D-differentially methylated region (DMR) at p < 0.05 and 1 DMR using next a permutation-based multiple testing correction method. This DMR is located in an imprinted region previously associated with T1D on the chromosome 14 that encompasses RTL1 gene and 2 miRNAs (miR136 and miR432). Using pyrosequencing-based bisulfite PCR, we replicated this association in a different and larger set of T1D patients and controls. DNA methylation at this DMR was inversely correlated with RTL1 gene expression and positively correlated with miR136 expression in human placentas. The DMR identified in this study presents suggestive evidence for altered methylation site in T1D and provide a promising new candidate gene. RTL1 is essential for placental permeability function in the mid-to-late fetal stages. We suggest that hypo-methylation could increase the fetal exposure to environmental factors in T1D susceptibility.",2.569,1846

Drought is an important factor that limits its growth, distribution, and yield. DNA methylation affects gene expression and plays an important role in adaptation to adverse environments. In this study, the DNA methylation changes in perennial ryegrass under drought stress were assessed using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP). After 15 days of drought stress treatment, the plant height was less than half of the control, and the leaves were smaller and darker. Genome-wide, a total of 652 CCGG sites were detected by MSAP. The total methylation level was 57.67 and 47.39 % in the control and drought treatment, respectively, indicating a decrease of 10.28 % due to drought exposure. Fifteen differentially displayed DNA fragments in MSAP profiles were cloned for sequencing analysis. The results showed that most of the genes involved in stress responses. The relative expression levels revealed that three demethylated fragments were up-regulated. The expression of a predicted retrotransposon increased significantly, changing from hypermethylation to non-methylation. Although the extent of methylation in two other genes decreased, the sites of methylation remained, and the expression increased only slightly. All of these results suggested that drought stress decreased the total DNA methylation level in perennial ryegrass and demethylation up-regulated related gene expressions and that the extent of methylation was negatively correlated with expression. Overall, the induced epigenetic changes in genome probably are an important regulatory mechanism for acclimating perennial ryegrass to drought and possibly other environmental stresses.",2.728,1413

The samples were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), standard bisulfite pyrosequencing, and genotyped for the rs1690252 MGMT promoter single nucleotide polymorphism. Monoallelic methylation was observed more frequently than biallelic methylation, and some cases with monoallelic methylation expressed the MGMT protein whereas others did not. The presence of MGMT methylation was associated with better overall survival (p = 0.006; qMSP and p = 0.002; standard pyrosequencing), and the presence of the protein was associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.009). Combined analyses of qMSP and standard pyrosequencing or IHC identified additional patients who benefited from temozolomide treatment. Finally, low methylation levels were also associated with better overall survival (p = 0.061; qMSP and p = 0.02; standard pyrosequencing).

Compared with the controls, the in vitro-cultured ovarian granulosa cells of the 12,500 ppm group showed significantly reduced in vitro progesterone and oestradiol secretion. Elevated progesterone secretion was observed in the 500 ppm group, and decreased and significantly upregulated mRNA expression of the Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd3b genes was observed in the 12,500 ppm and 500 ppm groups, respectively. The protein expression levels were consistent with the mRNA expression levels. Methylation screening of the promoter regions of these genes was performed using MeDIP-chip and confirmed by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM), and the observed methylation state changes of the promoter regions were correlated with the gene expression levels.

Although there is evidence implicating genetic, infectious, environmental, and inflammatory causes, the etiology of BA remains unknown. We have recently reported that cholangiocytes from BA patients showed decreased DNA methylation relative to disease- and non-disease controls, supporting a potential role for DNA hypomethylation in BA etiopathogenesis. In the current study, we examined the methylation status of specific genes in human BA livers using methylation microarray technology. We found global DNA hypomethylation in BA samples as compared to disease- and non-disease controls at specific genetic loci. Hedgehog pathway members, SHH and GLI2, known to be upregulated in BA, were both hypomethylated, validating this approach as an investigative tool. Another region near the PDGFA locus was the most significantly hypomethylated in BA, suggesting potential aberrant expression. Validation assays confirmed increased transcriptional and protein expression of PDGFA in BA livers. We also show that PDGF-A protein is specifically localized to cholangiocytes in human liver samples. Injection of PDGF-AA protein dimer into zebrafish larvae caused biliary developmental and functional defects. In addition, activation of the Hedgehog pathway caused increased expression of PDGF-A in zebrafish larvae, providing a previously unrecognized link between PDGF and the Hedgehog pathway. Our findings implicate DNA hypomethylation as a specific factor in mediating overexpression of genes associated with BA and identify PDGF as a new candidate in BA pathogenesis.",3.234,1799

Recently we have shown that the human placenta genome has a unique epigenetic pattern of large partially methylated domains (PMDs) and highly methylated domains (HMDs) with gene body DNA methylation positively correlating with level of gene expression. In order to determine the evolutionary conservation of DNA methylation patterns and transcriptional regulatory programs in the placenta, we performed a genome-wide methylome (MethylC-seq) analysis of human, rhesus macaque, squirrel monkey, mouse, dog, horse, and cow placentas as well as opossum extraembryonic membrane. We found that, similar to human placenta, mammalian placentas and opossum extraembryonic membrane have globally lower levels of methylation compared to somatic tissues. Higher relative gene body methylation was the conserved feature across all mammalian placentas, despite differences in PMD/HMDs and absolute methylation levels. Specifically, higher methylation over the bodies of genes involved in mitosis, vesicle-mediated transport, protein phosphorylation, and chromatin modification was observed compared with the rest of the genome. As in human placenta, higher methylation is associated with higher gene expression and is predictive of genic location across species. Analysis of DNA methylation in oocytes and preimplantation embryos shows a conserved pattern of gene body methylation similar to the placenta. Intriguingly, mouse and cow oocytes and mouse early embryos have PMD/HMDs but their placentas do not, suggesting that PMD/HMDs are a feature of early preimplantation methylation patterns that become lost during placental development in some species and following implantation of the embryo.",7.528,351

To investigate how methylation regulates imprinting of CDKN1C in cattle, allele-specific methylation patterns in two putative differential methylation regions (DMRs), the CDKN1C DMR and KvDMR1, were analyzed in three tissues (liver, spleen and lung) using bisulfite sequencing PCR. Our results show that in the CDKN1C DMR both parental alleles were unmethylated in all three analyzed tissues. In contrast, KvDMR1 was differentially methylated between the two parental alleles in the same tissues. Statistical analysis showed that there is a significant difference in the methylation level between the two parental alleles (P < 0.01), confirming that this region is the DMR of KvDMR1 and that it may be correlated with CDKN1C imprinting.",2.207,678

This study sought to evaluate the values of postoperative serum methylation levels of 7 genes for prognostication and especially for recurrence detection after curative resection. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 150 patients with stage I-III CRC from whom 3 consecutive blood sampling was taken 1 week before, and 6 months and 1 year after operation. Methylation levels of 7 genes were evaluated via quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Serum CEA was measured in parallel. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were followed by construction of receiver operating characteristic curves for recurrence detection. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 59 months, 43 patients (28.7%) developed recurrent lesions. High serum methylation levels of TAC1 in serum at 6-month follow-up (6M-FU), and SEPT9 at 1-year follow-up (1Y-FU) were independent predictors for tumor recurrence and unfavorable cancer-specific survival (CSS) (P < .05 in all tests). Serum NELL1 methylation levels were significant alone for CSS at both 6M-FU and 1Y-FU, but not for disease-free survival. Dynamic changes of TAC1 and SEPT9 with methylation increment were also independently predictive for recurrence (P < .05 in all tests). More importantly, TAC1 at 6M-FU and SEPT9 at 1Y-FU exhibited earlier detection of potential recurrences compared with concurrent serum CEA. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of TAC1 and SEPT9 methylation detected in postoperative sera of patients with CRC appear to be novel promising prognostic markers and may probably be considered for monitoring of CRC recurrence.",4.889,1694

Whether the molecular mechanisms by which FAIM2 affects obesity are involved in lifestyle is unclear.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The FAIM2 promoter methylation was quantified using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Sedentary behaviour and physical activity were investigated using a questionnaire. The influences of different lifestyles on methylation variations in obese and lean children were examined by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The methylation levels at seven CpG sites of the FAIM2 promoter were significantly associated with sedentary behaviour, especially the methylation levels at site -975, site -413, sites -362 and -360, and sites -353 and -349 (p=0.00004, 0.00009, 0.0006 and 0.00005, respectively). There were significant differences between the methylation levels at four CpG sites in obese and lean participants with high or moderate physical activity level <150 min/week.

However, it may also cause maternally inherited hearing loss in the absence of aminoglycoside exposure or any other clinical features (non-syndromic hearing loss). Although m.1555A>G was identified as a cause of deafness more than twenty years ago, the pathogenic mechanism of this mutation of ribosomal RNA remains controversial. Different mechanistic concepts have been proposed. Most recently, evidence from cell lines and animal models suggested that patients with m.1555A>G may have more 12S rRNA N6, N6-dimethyladenosine (m(6) 2A) methylation than controls, so-called 'hypermethylation'. This has been implicated as a pathogenic mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction but has yet to be validated in patients. 12S m(6) 2A rRNA methylation, by the mitochondrial transcription factor 1 (TFB1M) enzyme, occurs at two successive nucleotides (m.1584A and m.1583A) in close proximity to m.1555A>G. We examined m(6) 2A methylation in 14 patients with m.1555A>G, and controls, and found all detectable 12S rRNA transcripts to be methylated in both groups. Moreover, different RNA samples derived from the same patient (lymphocyte, fibroblast and lymphoblast) revealed that only transformed cells contained some unmethylated 12S rRNA transcripts, with all detectable 12S rRNA transcripts derived from primary samples m(6) 2A-methylated. Our data indicate that TFB1M 12S m(6) 2A rRNA hypermethylation is unlikely to be a pathogenic mechanism and may be an artefact of previous experimental models studied. We propose that RNA methylation studies in experimental models should be validated in primary clinical samples to ensure that they are applicable to the human situation.",6.393,624

In addition, to analyze the methylation status of the LCR in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Methylation patterns of HPV16 LCR in UM-SCC47, CaSki, and SiHa cells and HPV16-positiive OPSCC specimens were detected by bisulfite-sequencing PCR and TA cloning. For cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and E6 and E7 knockdown, MTS and trypan blue staining, annexin-V and 7-AAD staining, and prodidium iodide were used to evaluate cell growth and cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, respectively. E6 and E7 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: Hypermethylation status of the LCR in UM-SCC47 (79.8%) and CaSki cells (90.0%) and unmethylation status of the LCR in SiHa cells (0%) were observed. Upon demethylation, the cells with different methylation levels responded differently during growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, as well as in terms of their E6 and E7 expression. In HPV16-positive OPSCC patients, the methylation rates were 9.5% in the entire LCR region, 13.9% in the 5'-LCR, 6.0% in the E6 enhancer, and 9.5% in the p97 promoter, and hypermethylation of p97 promoter was found in a subset of cases (20.0%, 2/10). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed two different methylation levels of the LCR in HPV16-positive cancer cells and OPSCC patients, which may represent different carcinogenesis mechanisms of HPV-positive cancers cells.

While the antiviral regulatory mechanism of RIG-I remains largely unclear. In this study, the mechanism of CiRIG-I (Ctenopharyngodon idella RIG-I) against grass carp reovirus (GCRV) would be revealed from the perspective of epigenetics. By prediction, three CpG islands (CGIs) were located in 5'-flanking region and the first exon. The first CGI and the second one, both located in the 5'-flanking region, were 109 base pairs (bp) and 134bp in length, involving five CpG sites and four loci, respectively. The third CGI was of 386bp spanning the 5'-flanking region and the first exon, densely possessing 24 CpG sites. DNA methylation statuses of CpG sites were identified by virtue of the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) in spleen of all susceptible and resistant individuals post the challenge experiment. The resistance association analysis was performed with Chi-square test. And the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in CiRIG-I was investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Results indicated only the methylation of -534 CpG site in the second CGI possessing tight association with the resistance against GCRV, which was significantly higher in the susceptible individuals than that in the resistant individuals. In addition, the average expression of CiRIG-I was down-regulated in the susceptible group compared with the resistant one demonstrating gene transcription may be negatively-regulated by DNA methylation in CiRIG-I. Collectively, the methylation statuses of CiRIG-I were extremely related to the resistance against GCRV and maybe serve as a negative modulator on antiviral transcription of CiRIG-I.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: ERbeta methylation status was determined for 132 pairs of breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues via the MethyLight method. Additionally, mRNA relative expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether aberrant methylation had a negative correlation with expression. The correlation of ERbeta promoter methylation and clinical parameters is also discussed. RESULTS: Methylation was observed in 96 (72.7%) breast cancer samples, and the median percentage of fully methylated reference (PMR) among methylated tissues was 0.83. Meanwhile, 94 (71.2%) adjacent normal tissues were methylated and the median PMR was 0.48. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, the methylation level of breast cancer was significantly higher (p < 0.001) and mRNA expression was much lower (p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between ERbeta methylation and mRNA expression in adjacent normal breast tissues (p = 0.004). In addition, the methylation rate of cancer tissues whose maximum diameter < 3 cm was significantly higher than those > 3 cm (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: ERbeta promoter methylation level varies between cancerous and adjacent normal breast tissues. There was significant downregulation of ERbeta methylation expression in pre-cancerous stages of breast cancer. Therefore, demethylation drugs may offer a potential strategy for preventing the development of pre-cancerous cells.",2.645,1085
25107983,Syntrophs dominate sequences associated with the mercury methylation-related gene hgcA in the water conservation areas of the Florida Everglades.,"['Bae HS', 'Dierberg FE', 'Ogram A']",Applied and environmental microbiology,2014,"The mechanisms and rates of mercury methylation in the Florida Everglades are of great concern because of potential adverse impacts on human and wildlife health through mercury accumulation in aquatic food webs. We developed a new PCR primer set targeting hgcA, a gene encoding a corrinoid protein essential for Hg methylation across broad phylogenetic boundaries, and used this primer set to study the distribution of hgcA sequences in soils collected from three sites along a gradient in sulfate and nutrient concentrations in the northern Everglades. The sequences obtained were distributed in diverse phyla, including Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Methanomicrobia; however, hgcA clone libraries from all sites were dominated by sequences clustering within the order Syntrophobacterales of the Deltaproteobacteria (49 to 65% of total sequences). dsrB mRNA sequences, representing active sulfate-reducing prokaryotes at the time of sampling, obtained from these sites were also dominated by Syntrophobacterales (75 to 89%). Laboratory incubations with soils taken from the site low in sulfate concentrations also suggested that Hg methylation activities were primarily mediated by members of the order Syntrophobacterales, with some contribution by methanogens, Chloroflexi, iron-reducing Geobacter, and non-sulfate-reducing Firmicutes inhabiting the sites. This suggests that prokaryotes distributed within clades defined by syntrophs are the predominant group controlling methylation of Hg in low-sulfate areas of the Everglades. Any strategy for managing mercury methylation in the Everglades should consider that net mercury methylation is not limited to the action of sulfate reduction.",3.668,362

In this study, we examined gene methylation in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) using cationic conjugated polymer (CCP)-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to evaluate the application of cumulative methylation alternations of genes associated with cancer antigen 125 for early cancer diagnosis. The methylation status of 3 genes (Ras association domain family 1 isoform A, RASSF1A; opioid-binding protein/cell adhesion molecule, OPCML; homeobox A9, HOXA9) were examined and compared in 35 EOC samples and 11 normal ovarian tissue samples using CCP-based FRET. Gene methylation levels were clustered into 3 sections and assigned a value; values for the 3 genes were summed. Although methylation of the OPCML gene was significantly associated with stage, histological types, grade, and ascites and that of RASSF1A and HOXA9 was not, the sum for the 3 genes was significantly associated with stage and ascites. The sum showed higher sensitivity (85.7%) and specificity (100%) for discriminating EOC from normal ovarian tissues than did the methylation status of RASSF1A, OPCML, and HOXA9 (48.6, 77.1, 77.1, and 100, 88.1, 100%, respectively). Combining cancer antigen 125 levels with the sum increased the sensitivity to 94.3%. The detection and analysis of a panel of genes' methylation status with the CCP-based FRET technique may be useful for diagnosis and screening of EOC; the associated cancer antigen 125 can be used to increase diagnostic sensitivity.",0.775,617

SUMMARY ANSWER: DNA methylation patterns, not only at specific loci but also at Alu Yb8 repetitive sequences, are altered in infertile individuals compared with fertile controls. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Aberrant DNA methylation of sperm has been associated with human male infertility in patients demonstrating either deficiencies in the process of spermatogenesis or low semen quality. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Case and control prospective study. This study compares 46 sperm samples obtained from 17 normospermic fertile men and 29 normospermic infertile patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Illumina Infinium HD Human Methylation 450K arrays were used to identify genomic regions showing differences in sperm DNA methylation patterns between five fertile and seven infertile individuals. Additionally, global DNA methylation of sperm was measured using the Methylamp Global DNA Methylation Quantification Ultra kit (Epigentek) in 14 samples, and DNA methylation at several repetitive sequences (LINE-1, Alu Yb8, NBL2, D4Z4) measured by bisulfite pyrosequencing in 44 sperm samples. A sperm-specific DNA methylation pattern was obtained by comparing the sperm methylomes with the DNA methylomes of differentiated somatic cells using data obtained from methylation arrays (Illumina 450 K) of blood, neural and glial cells deposited in public databases. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In this study we conduct, for the first time, a genome-wide study to identify alterations of sperm DNA methylation in individuals with unexplained infertility that may account for the differences in their biological fertility compared with fertile individuals. We have identified 2752 CpGs showing aberrant DNA methylation patterns, and more importantly, these differentially methylated CpGs were significantly associated with CpG sites which are specifically methylated in sperm when compared with somatic cells. We also found statistically significant (P < 0.001) associations between DNA hypomethylation and regions corresponding to those which, in somatic cells, are enriched in the repressive histone mark H3K9me3, and between DNA hypermethylation and regions enriched in H3K4me1 and CTCF, suggesting that the relationship between chromatin context and aberrant DNA methylation of sperm in infertile men could be locus-dependent. Finally, we also show that DNA methylation patterns, not only at specific loci but also at several repetitive sequences (LINE-1, Alu Yb8, NBL2, D4Z4), were lower in sperm than in somatic cells. Interestingly, sperm samples at Alu Yb8 repetitive sequences of infertile patients showed significantly lower DNA methylation levels than controls. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our results are descriptive and further studies would be needed to elucidate the functional effects of aberrant DNA methylation on male fertility. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Overall, our data suggest that aberrant sperm DNA methylation might contribute to fertility impairment in couples with unexplained infertility and they provide a promising basis for future research.

The molecular pathways associated with FMR1 epigenetic silencing are still elusive, and their characterization may enhance the discovery of novel therapeutic targets as well as the development of novel clinical biomarkers for disease status. RESULTS: We have deployed customized epigenomic profiling assays to comprehensively map the FMR1 locus chromatin landscape in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) from eight FXS patients and in fibroblast cell lines derived from three FXS patient. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation (5-methylcytosine (5mC)) and hydroxymethylation (5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)) profiling using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with a custom FMR1 microarray identifies novel regions of DNA (hydroxy)methylation changes within the FMR1 gene body as well as in proximal flanking regions. At the region surrounding the FMR1 transcriptional start sites, increased levels of 5mC were associated to reciprocal changes in 5hmC, representing a novel molecular feature of FXS disease. Locus-specific validation of FMR1 5mC and 5hmC changes highlighted inter-individual differences that may account for the expected DNA methylation mosaicism observed at the FMR1 locus in FXS patients. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) profiling of FMR1 histone modifications, together with 5mC/5hmC and gene expression analyses, support a functional relationship between 5hmC levels and FMR1 transcriptional activation and reveal cell-type specific differences in FMR1 epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, whilst 5mC FMR1 levels positively correlated with FXS disease severity (clinical scores of aberrant behavior), our data reveal for the first time an inverse correlation between 5hmC FMR1 levels and FXS disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: We identify novel, cell-type specific, regions of FMR1 epigenetic changes in FXS patient cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of FXS. We propose that the combined measurement of 5mC and 5hmC at selected regions of the FMR1 locus may significantly enhance FXS clinical diagnostics and patient stratification.",4.543,1831

CpG methylation in promoters is an epigenetic modification, which regulates gene transcription. Using targeted bisulfite sequencing, we examined methylation of 2100 genes (56,000 CpGs) mapped by deep sequencing of T cell activation in human naive and memory CD4 T cells. Four hundred sixty-six CpGs (132 genes) displayed differential methylation between naive and memory cells. Twenty-one genes exhibited both differential methylation and gene expression before activation, linking promoter DNA methylation states to gene regulation; 6 of 21 genes encode proteins closely studied in T cells, whereas 15 genes represent novel targets for further study. Eighty-four genes demonstrated differential methylation between memory and naive cells that correlated to differential gene expression following activation, of which 39 exhibited reduced methylation in memory cells coupled with increased gene expression upon activation compared with naive cells. These reveal a class of primed genes more rapidly expressed in memory compared with naive cells and putatively regulated by DNA methylation. These findings define a DNA methylation signature unique to memory CD4 T cells that correlates with activation-induced gene expression.",1.82,1019

While it has been hypothesized that the p16 methylation states are dynamically maintained in cancer cells, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis has not been available until now. METHODS: A fusion cell model was established which reprogrammed the native DNA methylation pattern of the cells. The methylation status of the p16 alleles was then repeatedly quantitatively analyzed in the fusion monoclonal, parental cancer cell lines (p16-completely methylated-AGS and unmethylated-MGC803), and HCT116 non-fusion cell using DHPLC and bisulfite sequencing. Histone methylation was analyzed using chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)-PCR. P16 expression status was determined using immuno-staining and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The methylation status for the majority of the p16 alleles was stably maintained in the fusion monoclonal cells after up to 60 passages. Most importantly, focal de novo methylation, demethylation, and hydroxymethylation were consistently observed within about 27% of the p16 alleles in the fusion monoclones, but not the homozygously methylated or unmethylated parental cells. Furthermore, subclones of the monoclones consistently maintained the same p16 methylation pattern. A similar phenomenon was also observed using the p16 hemi-methylated HCT116 non-fusion cancer cell line. Interestingly, transcription was not observed in p16 alleles that were hydroxymethylated with an antisense-strand-specific pattern. Also, the levels of H3K9 and H3K4 trimethylation in the fusion cells were found to be slightly lower than the parental AGS and MGC803 cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study provides the first direct evidence confirming that the methylation states of p16 CpG islands is not only homeostatically maintained, but also accompanied by a dynamic process of transient focal methylation, demethylation, and hydroxymethylation in cancer cells.",3.234,1357
25931004,Genistein increases estrogen receptor beta expression in prostate cancer via reducing its promoter methylation.,"['Mahmoud AM', 'Al-Alem U', 'Ali MM', 'Bosland MC']",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2015,"Genistein has protective effects against prostate cancer (PCa) but whether this protection involves an estrogen receptor (ER) beta dependent mechanism has yet to be elucidated. ER-beta has a tumor suppressor role in PCa and its levels decline with cancer progression which was linked to ER-beta promoter hypermethylation. Genistein has been suggested to have demethylating activities in cancer. However, the ability of genistein to reverse ER-beta promoter hypermethylation in PCa has not been studied. In addition, there are great discrepancies among studies that examined the effect of genistein on ER-beta gene expression. Therefore, we sought to explore effects of genistein on ER-beta promoter methylation as a mechanism of modulating ER-beta expression using three PCa cell lines, LNCaP, LAPC-4 and PC-3. We also examined the role of ER-beta in mediating the preventive action of genistein. Our data demonstrated that genistein at physiological ranges (0.5-10 mumol/L) reduced ER-beta promoter methylation significantly with corresponding dose-dependent increases in ER-beta expression in LNCaP and LAPC-4 but not in PC-3 cells, which could be attributed to the low basal levels of ER-beta promoter methylation in PC-3 cell line. Genistein induced phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of ER-beta in all three PCa cell lines. Inhibitory effects of genistein on LAPC-4 and PC-3 cell proliferation were diminished using a specific ER-beta antagonist. In conclusion, genistein and ER-beta act together to prevent PCa cell proliferation; genistein increases ER-beta levels via reducing its promoter methylation and ER-beta, in turn, mediates the preventive action of genistein.",0,669

We have therefore addressed changes in sperm DNA cytosine methylation induced by cryopreservation of stallion semen. The relative amount of 5-methylcytosine relative to the genomic cytosine content of sperm DNA was analyzed by ELISA. In experiment 1, raw semen (n = 6 stallions, one ejaculate each) was shock-frozen. Postthaw semen motility and membrane integrity were completely absent, whereas DNA methylation was similar in raw (0.4 +/- 0.2%) and shock-frozen (0.3 +/- 0.1%) semen (not significant). In experiment 2, three ejaculates per stallion (n = 6) were included. Semen quality and DNA methylation was assessed before addition of the freezing extender and after freezing-thawing with either Ghent (G) or BotuCrio (BC) extender. Semen motility, morphology, and membrane integrity were significantly reduced by cryopreservation but not influenced by the extender (e.g., total motility: G 69.5 +/- 2.0, BC 68.4 +/- 2.2%; P < 0.001 vs. centrifugation). Cryopreservation significantly (P < 0.01) increased the level of DNA methylation (before freezing 0.6 +/- 0.1%, postthaw G 6.4 +/- 3.7, BC 4.4 +/- 1.5%; P < 0.01), but no differences between the freezing extenders were seen. The level of DNA methylation was not correlated to semen motility, morphology, or membrane integrity. The results demonstrate that semen processing for cryopreservation increases the DNA methylation level in stallion semen. We conclude that assessment of sperm DNA methylation allows for evaluation of an additional parameter characterizing semen quality. The lower fertility rates of mares after insemination with frozen-thawed semen may at least in part be explained by cytosine methylation of sperm-DNA induced by the cryopreservation procedure.",1.798,433

Although the levels of DNA methyltransferases change dynamically in the neonatal and early postnatal male germ cells, detailed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of these cells during the stem cell formation and differentiation have not been reported. RESULTS: To understand the regulation of spermatogonial stem cell formation and differentiation, we examined the DNA methylation and gene expression dynamics of male mouse germ cells at the critical stages: neonatal prospermatogonia, and early postntal (day 7) undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia. We found large partially methylated domains similar to those found in cancer cells and placenta in all these germ cells, and high levels of non-CG methylation and 5-hydroxymethylcytosines in neonatal prospermatogonia. Although the global CG methylation levels were stable in early postnatal male germ cells, and despite the reported scarcity of differential methylation in the adult spermatogonial stem cells, we identified many regions showing stage-specific differential methylation in and around genes important for stem cell function and spermatogenesis. These regions contained binding sites for specific transcription factors including the SOX family members. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a distinctive and dynamic regulation of DNA methylation during spermatogonial stem cell formation and differentiation in the neonatal and early postnatal testes. Furthermore, we revealed a unique accumulation and distribution of non-CG methylation and 5hmC marks in neonatal prospermatogonia. These findings contrast with the reported scarcity of differential methylation in adult spermatogonial stem cell differentiation and represent a unique phase of male germ cell development.",3.986,365

A common reaction of radical SAM (RS) enzymes is the methylation of unactivated carbon or phosphorous atoms found in numerous primary and secondary metabolites, as well as in proteins, sugars, lipids, and RNA. However, neither the chemical mechanisms by which these unactivated atoms obtain methyl groups nor the actual methyl donors are conserved. In fact, RS methylases have been grouped into three classes based on protein architecture, cofactor requirement, and predicted mechanism of catalysis. Class A methylases use two cysteine residues to methylate sp(2)-hybridized carbon centers. Class B methylases require a cobalamin cofactor to methylate both sp(2)-hybridized and sp(3)-hybridized carbon centers as well as phosphinate phosphorous atoms. Class C methylases share significant sequence homology with the RS enzyme, HemN, and may bind two SAM molecules simultaneously to methylate sp(2)-hybridized carbon centers. Lastly, we describe a new class of recently discovered RS methylases. These Class D methylases, unlike Class A, B, and C enzymes, which use SAM as the source of the donated methyl carbon, are proposed to methylate sp(2)-hybridized carbon centers using methylenetetrahydrofolate as the source of the appended methyl carbon.",0,1522

Previous work showed that in the western part of North Africa, a region of low incidence of HCC, mutations are scarce for this tumor type. As epigenetic changes are considered possible surrogates to mutations in human cancers, we decided, thus, to characterize DNA methylation in HCC from North-African patients. METHODS: A set of 11 loci was investigated in a series of 45 tumor specimens using methylation-specific and combined-bisulfite restriction assay PCR. Results obtained on clinical samples were subsequently validated in liver cancer cell lines. RESULTS: DNA methylation at tumor suppressor loci is significantly higher in samples displaying chromosome instability. More importantly, DNA methylation was significantly higher in Arg/Arg when compared to Pro/Pro genotype carriers at codon 72 rs1042522 of TP53 (65% vs 20% methylated loci, p = 0.0006), a polymorphism already known to affect somatic mutation rate in human carcinomas. In vitro experiments in cell lines indicated that enzymes controlling DNA methylation were differentially regulated by codon 72 Arg or Pro isoforms of p53. Furthermore, the Arg72-carrying version of p53 was shown to re-methylate DNA more rapidly than the pro-harboring isoform. Finally, Pro-carrying cell lines were shown to be significantly more resistant to decitabine treatment (two-fold, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that Arg72Pro polymorphism in a WT p53 context may act as a primary driver of epigenetic changes in HCC. It suggests, in addition, that rs1042522 genotype may predict sensitivity to epigenetic-targeted therapy. This model of liver tumorigenesis that associates low penetrance genetic predisposition to epigenetic changes emerges from a region of low HCC incidence and it may, therefore, apply essentially to population living in similar areas.

Aflatoxin is a contaminant of staple foods in sub-Saharan Africa, is a known human liver carcinogen and has been associated with stunting in infants. METHODS: We have measured aflatoxin exposure in 115 pregnant women in The Gambia and examined the DNA methylation status of white blood cells from their infants at 2-8 months old (mean 3.6 +/- 0.9). Aflatoxin exposure in women was assessed using an ELISA method to measure aflatoxin albumin (AF-alb) adducts in plasma taken at 1-16 weeks of pregnancy. Genome-wide DNA methylation of infant white blood cells was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450beadchip. RESULTS: AF-alb levels ranged from 3.9 to 458.4 pg/mg albumin. We found that aflatoxin exposure in the mothers was associated to DNA methylation in their infants for 71 CpG sites (false discovery rate < 0.05), with an average effect size of 1.7% change in methylation. Aflatoxin-associated differential methylation was observed in growth factor genes such as FGF12 and IGF1, and immune-related genes such as CCL28, TLR2 and TGFBI. Moreover, one aflatoxin-associated methylation region (corresponding to the miR-4520b locus) was identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that maternal exposure to aflatoxin during the early stages of pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation patterns of infants, including in genes related to growth and immune function. This reinforces the need for interventions to reduce aflatoxin exposure, especially during critical periods of fetal and infant development.",9.176,252

Treatment of deprotonated L(2-) with MeI led to the selective methylation of the thiolate groups thus generating a novel potential ligand, Me2L, which is neutral and contains two thioether donors. The coordinating properties of Me2L were demonstrated by the synthesis of a first nickel(ii) complex: reaction with NiBr2 led to a mononuclear complex 2 where all donor atoms coordinate to the nickel ion, which completes its octahedral coordination sphere by the two bromide ligands. If, however, the complex [LNi]2 (1) is treated with MeI only one thiolate function per ligand moiety is methylated, while the other one remains a thiolate. This leads to [MeLNi](+) complex metal fragments, which trimerize including a mu3-bridging iodide ion to give the compound 3 that was tested with regards to ACS reactivity. While it behaved inert towards CO, attempts to replace the bridging iodide ligand by methyl units in reactions with nucleophilic methylation reagents led to a product, which could not be identified but reacted with CO.

Yeast trm7Delta mutants grow poorly due to lack of 2'-O-methylated C32 (Cm32 ) and Gm34 on tRNA(Phe) , catalyzed by Trm7-Trm732 and Trm7-Trm734, respectively, which in turn results in loss of wybutosine at G37 . Mutations in human FTSJ1, the likely TRM7 homolog, cause nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability (NSXLID), but the role of FTSJ1 in tRNA modification is unknown. Here, we report that tRNA(Phe) from two genetically independent cell lines of NSXLID patients with loss-of-function FTSJ1 mutations nearly completely lacks Cm32 and Gm34 , and has reduced peroxywybutosine (o2yW37 ). Additionally, tRNA(Phe) from an NSXLID patient with a novel FTSJ1-p.A26P missense allele specifically lacks Gm34 , but has normal levels of Cm32 and o2yW37 . tRNA(Phe) from the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae trm7-A26P mutant also specifically lacks Gm34 , and the reduced Gm34 is not due to weaker Trm734 binding. These results directly link defective 2'-O-methylation of the tRNA anticodon loop to FTSJ1 mutations, suggest that the modification defects cause NSXLID, and may implicate Gm34 of tRNA(Phe) as the critical modification. These results also underscore the widespread conservation of the circuitry for Trm7-dependent anticodon loop modification of eukaryotic tRNA(Phe) .",5.144,333

Western Blotting was performed on carotid plaques from our biobank with early (n=60) or advanced (n=60) stages of atherosclerosis and healthy carotid arteries (n=12) to analyse di-methylation patterns of histone H3 at positions K4, K9 and K27. In atherosclerotic lesions, di-methylation of H3K4 was unaltered and that of H3K9 and H3K27 significantly decreased compared to control arteries. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increased appearance of di-methylated H3K4 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), a decreased expression of di-methylated H3K9 in SMCs and inflammatory cells, and reduced di-methylated H3K27 in inflammatory cells in advanced versus early atherosclerosis. Expression of corresponding histone methyltransferases MLL2 and G9a was increased in advanced versus early atherosclerosis. Genomic DNA hypomethylation, as determined by PCR for methylated LINE1 and SAT-alpha, was observed in early and advanced plaques compared to control arteries and in cell-free serum of patients with high-grade carotid stenosis compared to healthy volunteers. In contrast, no differences in DNA methylation were observed in blood cells. Expression of DNA-methyltransferase DNMT1 was reduced in atherosclerotic plaques versus controls, DNMT3A was undetectable, and DNMT3B not altered. DNA-demethylase TET1 was increased in atherosclerosisc plaques. The extent of histone and DNA methylation and expression of some corresponding methyltransferases are significantly altered in atherosclerosis, suggesting a possible contribution of epigenetics in disease development.",4.984,16

The Netherlands Cohort Study with a case-cohort design included 120,852 subjects aged 55-69 yr in 1986. Diet was measured with a food-frequency questionnaire. After 20.3 yr of follow-up, paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were collected. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to analyze promoter methylation of 11 genes. ccRCC cases were classified into low (0-19% of the genes), intermediate (20-39%), and high (40%+) methylation. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted, stratified according to methylation, including 3980 subcohort members and 297 ccRCC cases. Increasing alcohol intake was associated with decreased ccRCC risk, but was not statistically significant; multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for >/=30 g alcohol/day versus 0 g/day was 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-1.24], and P-value for trend was 0.46. In strata according to methylation index, no significant heterogeneity was observed. Dietary folate intake was not associated with ccRCC risk. There was no significant heterogeneity between strata according to methylation index. There was no effect modification of alcohol and dietary folate intake on ccRCC risk, nor in strata according to methylation index.

The aim of this study was to identify differentially methylated genes with potential impact on AML pathogenesis based on the correlation of methylation and expression data. METHODS: The primary method of studying DNA methylation changes was targeted bisulfite sequencing capturing approximately 84 megabases (Mb) of the genome in 14 diagnostic AML patients and a healthy donors' CD34+ pool. Subsequently, selected DNA methylation changes were confirmed by 454 bisulfite pyrosequencing in a larger cohort of samples. Furthermore, we addressed gene expression by microarray profiling and correlated methylation of regions adjacent to transcription start sites with expression of corresponding genes. RESULTS: Here, we report a novel hypomethylation pattern, specific to CBFB-MYH11 fusion resulting from inv(16) rearrangement that is associated with genes previously described as upregulated in inv(16) AML. We assume that this hypomethylation and corresponding overexpresion occurs in the genes whose function is important in inv(16) leukemogenesis. Further, by comparing all targeted methylation and microarray expression data, PBX3 differential methylation was found to correlate with its gene expression. PBX3 has been recently shown to be a key interaction partner of HOX genes during leukemogenesis and we revealed higher incidence of relapses in PBX3-overexpressing patients. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered new genomic regions with aberrant DNA methylation that are associated with expression of genes involved in leukemogenesis. Our results demonstrate the potential of the targeted approach for DNA methylation studies to reveal new regulatory regions.",4.812,1857

OBJECTIVES: In this work we explore whether prenatal exposure to mixtures of xenoestrogens has the potential to alter the placenta epigenome, by studying DNA methylation in retrotransposons as a surrogate of global DNA methylation. METHODS: The biomarker total effective xenoestrogen burden (TEXB) was measured in 192 placentas from participants in the longitudinal INMA Project. DNA methylation was quantitatively assessed by bisulfite pyrosequencing on 10 different retrotransposons including 3 different long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), 4 short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and 3 human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Associations were tested using linear mixed-effects regression models and sex interaction was evaluated. RESULTS: A significant sex interaction was observed for AluYb8 (p-value for interaction <0.001, significant at Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold of 0.0025). Boys with the highest TEXB-alpha levels of exposure (third tertile) presented on average a decrease of 0.84% in methylation compared to those in the first tertile (p-value<0.001), while no significant effects were found in girls (p-value=0.134).

However, as an affinity-based method, MeRIP-Seq has yet provided base-pair resolution; that is, a single methylation site determined from MeRIP-Seq data can in practice contain multiple RNA methylation residuals, some of which can be regulated by different enzymes and thus differentially methylated between two conditions. Since existing peak-based methods could not effectively differentiate multiple methylation residuals located within a single methylation site, we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach to address this issue. Specifically, the detected RNA methylation site is further divided into multiple adjacent small bins and then scanned with higher resolution using a hidden Markov model to model the dependency between spatially adjacent bins for improved accuracy. We tested the proposed algorithm on both simulated data and real data. Result suggests that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms existing peak-based approach on simulated systems and detects differential methylation regions with higher statistical significance on real dataset.",1.579,1151

The aim of this study was to elucidate the contribution of aberrant promoter DNA methylation in pathological endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and subsequent cardiac fibrosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In human coronary endothelial cells, TGFbeta1 causes aberrant methylation of RASAL1 promoter, increased Ras-GTP activity, and EndMT. In end-stage failing vs. non-failing human myocardium, increased fibrosis was associated with significantly increased RASAL1 promoter methylation, decreased RASAL1 expression, increased Ras-GTP activity, and increased expression of markers of EndMT. In mice with pressure overload due to ascending aortic constriction, BMP7 significantly reduced RASAL1 promoter methylation, increased RASAL1 expression, and decreased EndMT markers as well as decreased cardiac fibrosis. The ten eleven translocation (TET) family enzyme TET3, which demethylates through hydroxymethylation, was significantly decreased in fibrotic mouse hearts, restored with BMP7, and BMP7 effects were absent in coronary endothelial cells with siRNA knockdown of TET3. CONCLUSION: Our study provides proof-in-principle evidence that transcriptional suppression of RASAL1 through aberrant promoter methylation contributes to EndMT and ultimately to progression of cardiac fibrosis. Such aberrant methylation can be reversed through Tet3-mediated hydroxymethylation, which can be specifically induced by BMP7. This may reflect a new treatment strategy to stop cardiac fibrosis.",5.94,572

We measured the methylation levels of the preceding six genes. We defined the methylation of three genes or more in the serum as SMS-positive in this study. We investigated the prognosis of SMS-positive patients. RESULTS: SMS-positive patients exhibited significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than SMS-negative patients (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that SMS positivity was an independent risk factor for shorter DFS (hazard ratio (HR)=2.182; p<0.001) and OS (HR=4.198; p<0.001).

How post-transcriptional methylation contributes to the human disease is currently unknown. By comparing gene expression data with global cytosine-5 RNA methylomes in patient fibroblasts and NSun2-deficient mice, we find that loss of cytosine-5 RNA methylation increases the angiogenin-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNA) leading to an accumulation of 5' tRNA-derived small RNA fragments. Accumulation of 5' tRNA fragments in the absence of NSun2 reduces protein translation rates and activates stress pathways leading to reduced cell size and increased apoptosis of cortical, hippocampal and striatal neurons. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that angiogenin binds with higher affinity to tRNAs lacking site-specific NSun2-mediated methylation and that the presence of 5' tRNA fragments is sufficient and required to trigger cellular stress responses. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of NSun2-deficient brains to oxidative stress can be rescued through inhibition of angiogenin during embryogenesis. In conclusion, failure in NSun2-mediated tRNA methylation contributes to human diseases via stress-induced RNA cleavage.",0,1396

The T variant of the MGMT promoter-enhancer single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs16906252) has been associated with the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in other cancers. We examined the association of the T allele of rs16906252 with glioblastoma development, tumor MGMT methylation, MGMT protein expression, and survival outcomes. METHODS: Two independent temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cohorts-one Australian (Australian Genomics and Clinical Outcomes of Glioma, n = 163) and the other American (University of California Los Angeles/Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles, n = 159)-were studied. Allelic bisulphite sequencing was used to determine if methylation was specific to the T allele. Additionally, we compared the incidence of the T allele between glioblastoma cases and matched controls to assess whether it was a risk factor for developing MGMT methylated glioblastoma. RESULTS: Carriage of the T allele of the rs16906252 SNP was associated with both MGMT methylation and low MGMT protein expression and predicted significantly longer survival in temozolomide-treated patients with both MGMT methylated and nonmethylated glioblastoma. Methylation was linked to the T allele, inferring that the T variant plays a key role in the acquisition of MGMT methylation. Carriage of the T allele was associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing glioblastoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; P = .013), increasing further when glioblastoma was classified by the presence of MGMT methylation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.86; P = .001).

Nevertheless, MGMT methylation status has not currently been introduced into routine clinical practice, as the choice of the ideal technique and tissue sample specimen is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare 2 analytical methods, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PSQ), and their use on 2 different tissue type samples, snap-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), obtained from a single-center and uniformly treated cohort of 46 GBM patients. We obtained methylation data from all frozen tissues, while no results were obtained for 5 FFPE samples. The highest concordance for methylation was found on frozen tissues (88.5%, 23/26 samples), using PSQ (76.7%, 23/30 samples). Moreover, we confirmed that OS and PFS for patients carrying methylation of the MGMT promoter were longer than for patients with an unmethylated promoter. In conclusion, we considered MSP a limited technique for FFPE tissues due to the high risk of false-positive results; in contrast, our data indicated PSQ as the most powerful method to stratify methylated/unmethylated patients as it allows reaching quantitative results with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, frozen tumor tissues were shown to be the best specimens for MGMT methylation analysis, due to the low DNA degradation and homogeneity in methylation throughout the tumor.",0,644

We have shown that a particular sulfation pattern mediated by the expression of carbohydrate (chondroitin 4) sulfotransferase-11 (CHST11) correlates with P-selectin binding and aggressiveness of human breast cancer cell lines. The present study was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of CHST11 expression and determine whether aberrant DNA methylation controls CHST11 expression in breast cancer. Publicly available datasets were used to examine the association of CHST11 expression to aggressiveness and progression of breast cancer. Methylation status was analyzed using bisulfite genomic sequencing. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC) was used for DNA demethylation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was performed in the CpG island of CHST11 with a minimum coverage of 10. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was employed to confirm the expression profile of CHST11 in breast cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry was also used to confirm the expression of the CHST11 product, chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A). The expression of CHST11 was significantly higher in basal-like and Her2-amplified cell lines compared to luminal cell lines. CHST11 was also highly expressed in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and the expression levels were significantly associated with tumor progression. We observed very low levels of DNA methylation in a CpG island of CHST11 in basal-like cells but very high levels in the same region in luminal cells. Treatment of MCF7 cells, a luminal cell line with very low expression of CHST11, with 5AzadC increased the expression of CHST11 and its immediate product, CS-A, in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that CHST11 may play a direct role in progression of breast cancer and that its expression is controlled by DNA methylation. Therefore, in addition to CHST11 mRNA levels, the methylation status of this gene also has potential as a prognostic biomarker.",3.025,1851

VANGL2 is a critical gene in the planar cell polarity pathway that plays an important role in the development of the heart. This study investigates the methylation status of the promoter region of VANGL2 and the expression pattern of VANGL2 in cardiac tissue. METHODS: The promoter region of VANGL2 was sequenced in 200 ToF patients and 400 control subjects. Methylation levels were measured in four regions of the VANGL2 promoter (B1-1: -282 bp  approximately  -117 bp, B1-2: -117 bp  approximately  41 bp, B2: 8 bp  approximately  157 bp, B3: 132 bp  approximately  401 bp) by bisulfite sequencing PCR in the right ventricular outflow tract of the myocardium. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. RESULTS: No mutations were found in the promoter region, but two SNPs (rs11582932 T>G, rs11265385 T>G) were found in ToF patients and controls with similar frequencies (p>0.05). The overall methylation status of the VANGL2 promoter was significantly higher in ToF patients than in controls (p=0.0234). Specifically, the methylation levels of regions B1-1 and B3 were significantly higher in ToF patients (p=0.0042, p=0.0418).

METHODS: We enrolled seventy-five glioblastoma patients that had presented with enlarged contrast-enhanced lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) one month after completing concurrent chemoradiotherapy and undergoing MGMT promoter methylation testing. The imaging parameters included 10 or 90 % histogram cutoffs of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC10), normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV90), and initial area under the time signal-intensity curve (IAUC90). The results of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with cross-validation were compared between MGMT methylation and unmethylation groups. RESULTS: MR imaging parameters demonstrated a trend toward higher accuracy in the MGMT promoter methylation group than in the unmethylation group (cross-validated AUCs = 0.70-0.95 and 0.56-0.87, respectively). The combination of MGMT methylation status with imaging parameters improved the AUCs from 0.70 to 0.75-0.90 for both readers in comparison with MGMT methylation status alone. The probability of pseudoprogression was highest (95.7 %) when nCBV90 was below 4.02 in the MGMT promoter methylation group. CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging parameters could be stronger predictors of pseudoprogression in glioblastoma patients with the methylated MGMT promoter than in patients with the unmethylated MGMT promoter. KEY POINTS: * The glioblastoma subgroup was stratified according to MGMT promoter methylation status. * Diagnostic values of diffusion and perfusion parameters for predicting pseudoprogression were compared. * Imaging parameters showed higher diagnostic accuracy in the MGMT promoter methylation group. * Imaging parameters were independent to MGMT promoter methylation status for predicting pseudoprogression. * Imaging biomarkers might demonstrate different diagnostic values according to MGMT promoter methylation.",4.014,869

Previously, we demonstrated that LINE-1 hypomethylation might contribute to the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior through genomic gains of oncogenes such as cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the relationship between LINE-1 hypomethylation and clinical outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. METHODS: LINE-1 methylation level in 208 samples of curatively resected HCCs was measured by pyrosequencing assay, and the prognostic value of LINE-1 methylation level in HCC was examined. RESULTS: LINE-1 methylation levels in the 208 HCC patients investigated were distributed as follows: mean 64.7; median 64.6; standard deviation (SD) 13.6; range 21.5-99.1; interquartile range 62.9-66.6. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed a significantly higher cancer recurrence rate in the low-methylation-level group than in the high-methylation-level group (hazard ratio 1.58; 95 % CI 1.05-2.47; p = 0.028). Interestingly, the influence of LINE-1 hypomethylation on patient outcome was modified by hepatitis virus infection (p of interaction = 0.023); LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with a higher cancer recurrence rate in patients without hepatitis virus infection (log-rank p = 0.0047). CDK6 messenger RNA expression levels were inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation levels (p = 0.0075; R = -0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, as measured by LINE-1 levels, might be associated with poor disease-free survival in HCC patients, suggesting a potential role for LINE-1 methylation level as a biomarker for identifying patients who will experience an unfavorable clinical outcome.",3.93,742

Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) regulates the cell physiological activity and involves in the adjustment of neural plasticity, function, and survival. This experiment tried to explore the possible effects of MKP-1 in hippocampus on depression of rats by determining the expression of MKP-1 mRNA and DNA methylation in MKP-1 gene promoter. The animal model was established by chronic unpredictable stress, and evaluated by open-field test and weight changes. All the rats were divided into the sham stimulation, the physiological saline, and the fluoxetine (1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mg/kg) groups randomly. The expression of MKP-1 mRNA in the hippocampus was measured by RT-PCR and the methylation of MKP-1 promoter DNA was detected by COBRA. The chronic unpredicted stress (1) increased the animal movement scores in open-field test, and fluoxetine could prevent this increasement; (2) increased the body weight, and fluoxetine could not prevent this increasement; and (3) increased MKP-1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus, and fluoxetine could prevent it. However, fluoxetine did not influence the DNA methylation of MKP-1 gene promoter in the hippocampus during the chronic unpredicted stress.

This plays a major role in several functions of normal cells, including cell differentiation, X chromosome inactivation, and the maintenance of chromatin structure, in mammalian development. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible differences in SNRPN gene methylation profiles in non-obese and obese individuals, and in children and adults. Our results did not reveal any statistical correlations between the DNA methylation profiles of the SNRPN gene in children or adult obese and non-obese groups. However, a comparison of the methylation levels with the chronological age revealed statistically significant differences between the means of methylation in adults and children (46.20 +/- 5.88 and 39.40 +/- 2.87, respectively; P < 0.001). Pearson's correlation analysis indicated a positive association between the level of DNA methylation and the chronological age (R2 = 0.326; P < 0.001). Therefore, we concluded that the methylation profile of the SNRPN promoter (in blood) is not a useful biomarker for determining the predisposition of an individual to obesity. Additionally, we have confirmed that SNRPN methylation increases with age, which raises further questions regarding the role of SNRPN expression during the aging process.",0.775,286
26032981,Distinct roles of DNMT1-dependent and DNMT1-independent methylation patterns in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells.,"['Li Z', 'Dai H', 'Martos SN', 'Xu B', 'Gao Y', 'Li T', 'Zhu G', 'Schones DE', 'Wang Z']",Genome biology,2015,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation patterns are initiated by de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a/3b adding methyl groups to CG dinucleotides in the hypomethylated genome of early embryos. These patterns are faithfully maintained by DNMT1 during DNA replication to ensure epigenetic inheritance across generations. However, this two-step model is based on limited data. RESULTS: We generated base-resolution DNA methylomes for a series of DNMT knockout embryonic stem cells, with deep coverage at highly repetitive elements. We show that DNMT1 and DNMT3a/3b activities work complementarily and simultaneously to establish symmetric CG methylation and CHH (H = A, T or C) methylation. DNMT3a/3b can add methyl groups to daughter strands after each cycle of DNA replication. We also observe an unexpected division of labor between DNMT1 and DNMT3a/3b in suppressing retrotransposon long terminal repeats and long interspersed elements, respectively. Our data suggest that mammalian cells use a specific CG density threshold to predetermine methylation levels in wild-type cells and the magnitude of methylation reduction in DNMT knockout cells. Only genes with low CG density can be induced or, surprisingly, suppressed in the hypomethylated genome. Lastly, we do not find any association between gene body methylation and transcriptional activity. CONCLUSIONS: We show the concerted actions of DNMT enzymes in the establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns. The finding of distinct roles of DNMT1-dependent and -independent methylation patterns in genome stability and regulation of transcription provides new insights for understanding germ cell development, neuronal diversity, and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and will help to develop next-generation DNMT inhibitors.",10.81,543

 Association for Cancer Research",2015,"PURPOSE: To identify tumor suppressor genes epigenetically silenced by promoter hypermethylation in extranodal natural killer cell lymphoma (NKCL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Promoter methylation was analyzed with global and locus-specific methylation assays in NKCL cases and NK cell lines. Gene expression profiles were used to identify genes for which aberrant promoter methylation was associated with transcriptional silencing. Selected DNA methylations were validated by RRBS, pyrosequencing, or q-MSP. Decitabine treatment was performed to evaluate reactivation of methylated genes. The tumor suppressor effect of silenced genes was evaluated functionally by reintroducing them into NK cell lines. RESULTS: We observed significant promoter hypermethylation in most NKCL samples compared with normal NK cells. Correlation of global promoter methylation with gene expression profiles identified 95 genes with strong evidence for being silenced because of promoter methylation, including BCL2L11 (BIM), DAPK1, PTPN6 (SHP1), TET2, SOCS6, and ASNS. Known tumor suppressor genes were significantly overrepresented in this set of genes. Decitabine treatment of NK cell lines was associated with reexpression of all 10 selected methylated and silenced genes. Ectopic expression of frequently silenced BIM in two BIM-nonexpressing NK cell lines led to increased apoptosis and eventual elimination of BIM-transduced cells. It also sensitized these cell lines to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Similarly, reintroduction of SOCS6 significantly inhibited growth in SOCS6-nonexpressing NK cell lines. NK cell lines lacking ASNS expression showed increased sensitivity to treatment with l-asparaginase. Reintroduction of ASNS reduced drug sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Promoter region hypermethylation is frequent in NKCL, and aberrantly methylated genes are pathologically and clinically significant.",8.722,1685

However, the exact mechanisms underlying BaP-induced impairment of neurological function remain unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the regulating mechanisms underlying the impact of chronic BaP exposure on neurobehavioral performance. METHODS: C57BL mice received either BaP in different doses (1.0, 2.5, 6.25 mg/kg) or olive oil twice a week for 90 days. Memory and emotional behaviors were evaluated using Y-maze and open-field tests, respectively. Furthermore, levels of mRNA expression were measured by using qPCR, and DNA methylation of NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2B) was examined using bisulfate pyrosequencing in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: Compared to controls, mice that received BaP (2.5, 6.25 mg/kg) showed deficits in short-term memory and an anxiety-like behavior. These behavioral alterations were associated with a down-regulation of the NR2B gene and a concomitant increase in the level of DNA methylation in the NR2B promoter in the two brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic BaP exposure induces an increase in DNA methylation in the NR2B gene promoter and down-regulates NR2B expression, which may contribute to its neurotoxic effects on behavioral performance. The results suggest that NR2B vulnerability represents a target for environmental toxicants in the brain.",3.234,1830

MATERIALS & METHODS: We investigated CpG island methylation of genes known to exhibit hypermethylation in leukemia using quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. RESULTS: Although methylation levels were reduced in remission samples, they remained significantly higher than those seen in healthy controls. This retained methylation was not related to low levels of residual leukemia cells still present at remission. Methylation levels were also stable (or increased) during continuous remission and significantly correlated with long-term survival in adult ALL patients.

Npas4 mRNA expression levels were decreased in the hippocampus of mice exposed to stress, which was accompanied by brain dysfunction. We have suggested that transient stress reduced Npas4 transcription through the glucocorticoid receptor. In the present report, we investigated the potential contribution of epigenetic modifications induced by stress on Npas4 gene expression. The Npas4 promoter region contains two CpG islands; in the hippocampus, chronic restraint stress increases the DNA methylation levels of both of these CpG islands. In the Neuro2a cell line, treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, increased Npas4 mRNA levels and markedly reduced the DNA methylation levels of CpG island 2 in the Npas4 promoter. The DNA methylation sites in CpG island 2 overlap with two cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element (CRE) sequences. Mutation of these CRE sequences reduced Npas4 promoter activity. These results suggest that transcription of the Npas4 gene is downregulated by stress through DNA methylation of its promoter.",1.52,1560

An epigenetic biomarker panel for predicting gastric carcinoma metastasis could have significant clinical impact on the care of patients with gastric carcinoma. The main purpose of this study is to characterize the methylation differences between gastric carcinomas with and without metastasis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between 4 metastatic and 4 nonmetastatic gastric carcinomas and their surgical margins (SM) were analyzed using methylated-CpG island amplification with microarray. The methylation states of 73 candidate genes were further analyzed in patients with gastric carcinoma in a discovery cohort (n=108) using denatured high performance liquid chromatography, bisulfite-sequencing, and MethyLight. The predictive values of potential metastasis-methylation biomarkers were validated in cohorts of patients with gastric carcinoma in China (n=330), Japan (n=129), and Korea (n=153). RESULTS: The gastric carcinoma genome showed significantly higher proportions of hypomethylation in the promoter and exon-1 regions, as well as increased hypermethylation of intragenic fragments when compared with SMs. Significant differential methylation was validated in the CpG islands of 15 genes (P<0.05) and confirmed using bisulfite sequencing.

Methylation changes of GFRA1, SRF, and ZNF382 resulted in up- or downregulation of their transcription. Most importantly, the prevalence of GFRA1, SRF, and ZNF382 methylation alterations was consistently and coordinately associated with gastric carcinoma metastasis and the patients' overall survival throughout discovery and validation cohorts in China, Japan, and Korea.

Smoking-related epigenetic biomarkers may open new avenues to better quantify the adverse health effects of smoking, and to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of F2RL3 methylation, a novel epigenetic biomarker of smoking exposure disclosed by recent genome-wide methylation studies. METHODS: Blood DNA methylation at F2RL3 (also known as PAR-4) was quantified in baseline samples of 3588 participants aged 50-75 years in a large population-based prospective cohort study by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 10.1 years. The associations of methylation intensity and of smoking with all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other mortality were assessed by Cox's proportional hazards regression, controlling for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Lower methylation intensity at F2RL3 was strongly associated with mortality. After adjustment for multiple covariates including smoking, hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, cancer or other causes were 2.60 (95% CI, 1.81-3.74), 2.45 (95% CI, 1.28-4.68), 2.94 (95% CI, 1.68-5.14) and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.11-5.16), respectively, in subjects in the lowest quartile of methylation intensity compared with subjects in the highest quartile. The associations with mortality outcomes were much stronger among men than among women. In addition, strong positive associations of smoking with each of the outcomes were substantially weakened, and almost disappeared when controlling for F2RL3 methylation intensity. CONCLUSIONS: F2RL3 methylation is a strong predictor of mortality, including all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other mortality. Systemic adverse effects of smoking may be mediated by pathways associated with F2RL3 methylation.",9.176,1583

The median follow-up time of the patients was 63 months and was used to analyze the relationship between PITX2 methylation status with tumor stage and survival rates. Median PITX2 gene expression in benign tissues was 1.46, which was higher than that of tumor tissues with a median of 0.01 (P < 0.001). The median methylation in the controls was less than 0.001%, while the median methylation in the test group was 23.3% (P = 0.000).

In fragile X syndrome (FXS), the boundary is lost, and the promoter is inactivated by methylation spreading. Here we document boundary stability in spite of critical expansions of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in male or female premutation carriers and in high functioning males (HFMs). HFMs carry a full CGG repeat expansion but exhibit an unmethylated promoter and lack the FXS phenotype. The boundary is also stable in Turner (45, X) females. A CTCF-binding site is located slightly upstream of the methylation boundary and carries a unique G-to-A polymorphism (single nucleotide polymorphism), which occurs 3.6 times more frequently in genomes with CGG expansions. The increased frequency of this single nucleotide polymorphism might have functional significance. In CGG expansions, the CTCF region does not harbor additional mutations. In FXS individuals and often in cells transgenomic for EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) DNA or for the telomerase gene, the large number of normally methylated CpGs in the far-upstream region of the boundary is decreased about 4-fold. A methylation boundary is also present in the human genome segment upstream of the HTT (huntingtin) promoter (4p16.3) and is stable both in normal and Huntington disease chromosomes.

We investigated whether gene methylation could meet sensitivity and specificity criteria for a robust biomarker. METHODS: IFI44L promoter methylation was examined using DNA samples from a discovery set including 377 patients with SLE, 358 healthy controls (HCs) and 353 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two independent sets including 1144 patients with SLE, 1350 HCs, 429 patients with RA and 199 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) were used for validation. RESULTS: Significant hypomethylation of two CpG sites within IFI44L promoter, Site1 (Chr1: 79 085 222) and Site2 (Chr1: 79 085 250; cg06872964), was identified in patients with SLE compared with HCs, patients with RA and patients with pSS. In a comparison between patients with SLE and HCs included in the first validation cohort, Site1 methylation had a sensitivity of 93.6% and a specificity of 96.8% at a cut-off methylation level of 75.5% and Site2 methylation had a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 98.2% at a cut-off methylation level of 25.5%. The IFI44L promoter methylation marker was also validated in an European-derived cohort. In addition, the methylation levels of Site1 and Site2 within IFI44L promoter were significantly lower in patients with SLE with renal damage than those without renal damage. Patients with SLE showed significantly increased methylation levels of Site1 and Site2 during remission compared with active stage.

Global methylation and IFG2/H19 ICR methylation were assessed in peripheral blood DNA from 42 non-smoking women with Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) and quantitative pyrosequencing, respectively. Linear regression models were applied to estimate associations between indoor air pollution and DNA methylation in the blood. Compared to women without exposure, the levels of LUMA methylation for women who had ever exposed to both coal and wood were reduced 6.70% (95% CI: -13.36, -0.04). Using both coal and wood before age 20 was associated with 6.95% decreased LUMA methylation (95% CI: -13.79, -0.11). Further, the negative correlations were more significant with exposure to solid fuels for cooking before age 20. There were no clear associations between indoor solid fuels exposure before age 20 and through the lifetime and IFG2/H19 ICR methylation.

Then, DNA methylation and gene expressions of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) were determined in the offspring. Offspring of FS diet had heavier body weight, impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and higher serum leptin level at 32-week age (p < 0.05). The expression of POMC and MC4R genes were significantly increased in offspring exposed to FS diet during gestation, lactation and into 32-week age (p < 0.05). Consistently, hypomethylation of POMC promoter in the hypothalamus occurred in the FS diet offspring (p < 0.05), compared with the C group. However, no methylation was detected of MC4R promoter in both the two groups. Furthermore, POMC-specific methylation (%) was negatively associated with glucose response to a glucose load (r = -0.273, p = 0.039). Maternal and post-weaning high-fat diet predisposes the offspring for obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in later life.

Methylation levels were regulated by genetics largely in cis, but we also found evidence of trans regulation, and we demonstrate that genetic variation in the methionine synthase reductase gene Mtrr affects methylation of hundreds of CpGs throughout the genome. Our results indicate that natural variation in methylation levels contributes to the etiology of complex clinical traits.",17.565,1387
26899867,A novel approach to investigation of the pathogenesis of pterygium based on assessment of promoter hyper-methylation and expression profile of CTLA4 gene: A credible report of CTLA4 gene expression in human eye tissue.,"['Ebrahimi ME', 'Kordi-Tamandani DM', 'Arish M']",Gene,2016,"BACKGROUND: Pterygium is the human eye lesion whose prevalence in the general population is estimated about 2%. The disease, in extreme phase, can lead to visual disturbance and eventually causes complete loss of vision due to the lesion growth over the papillary axis. Pterygium invasive tissue is a tumor-like tissue that is initially identified and then is attacked by cytotoxic T cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), as a modulator molecule of the adaptive immune system, plays a critical role in maintaining peripheral T cell tolerance by diminishing its responsiveness and increasing its activation threshold. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between some epigenetic changes of the CTLA4 gene, such as promoter methylation and gene expression, and pathogenesis of pterygia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 75 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of pterygia and 70 specimens of normal conjunctiva from eyes without pterygium as the control group, collected from Sistan and Baluchestan population. CTLA4 gene promoter methylation was carried out by methylation-specific PCR technique. The gene expression analysis was done on extracted total RNA from 20 healthy and 23 pterygium tissue samples using Real-Time PCR technique. RESULTS: Promoter methylation changes of CTLA4 gene were not statistically different in patients with pterygium in comparison with healthy controls (OR=1.614; 95% CI=0.57-4.75; P value=0.37). However, gene expression level of CTLA4 was remarkably different in patients and healthy controls (Mean+/-SD: 1.343+/-0.133 and 2.027+/-0.219, respectively; P value=0.009). CONCLUSION: This is a credible evidence of CTLA4 gene expression in human eye tissue. This first hand attempt of investigating the association of epigenetic changes of the CTLA4 gene and pathogenesis of pterygia, indicated a significant intensification of the gene expression of CTLA4 in patients with pterygia. We suggest that increasing CTLA4 gene expression can be a trigger which promotes pterygium enlargement. However, further studies on more populations with larger sample sizes need to be done to verify this hypothesis in the future.",2.138,122

The continuous increase in worldwide breast cancer incidences emphasizes the urgent need for identification of methylation biomarkers for early cancer detection and patient stratification. Using microfluidic PCR-based target enrichment and next-generation bisulfite sequencing technology, we analyzed methylation status of 48 candidate genes in paired tumor and normal tissues from 180 Chinese breast cancer patients. Analysis of the sequencing results showed 37 genes differentially methylated between tumor and matched normal tissues. Breast cancer samples with different clinicopathologic characteristics demonstrated distinct profiles of gene methylation. The methylation levels were significantly different between breast cancer subtypes, with basal-like and luminal B tumors having the lowest and the highest methylation levels, respectively. Six genes (ACADL, ADAMTSL1, CAV1, NPY, PTGS2, and RUNX3) showed significant differential methylation among the 4 breast cancer subtypes and also between the ER +/ER- tumors. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, we identified a panel of 13 hypermethylated genes as candidate biomarkers that performed a high level of efficiency for cancer prediction. These 13 genes included CST6, DBC1, EGFR, GREM1, GSTP1, IGFBP3, PDGFRB, PPM1E, SFRP1, SFRP2, SOX17, TNFRSF10D, and WRN. Our results provide evidence that well-defined DNA methylation profiles enable breast cancer prediction and patient stratification. The novel gene panel might be a valuable biomarker for early detection of breast cancer.",3.94,1018

However, no comprehensive studies using medication-free subjects with MDD have been conducted. Furthermore, the majority of these previous studies has been limited to the analysis of the CpG sites in CpG islands (CGIs) in the gene promoter regions. The main aim of the present study is to identify DNA methylation markers that distinguish patients with MDD from non-psychiatric controls. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral leukocytes was conducted in two set of samples, a discovery set (20 medication-free patients with MDD and 19 controls) and a replication set (12 medication-free patients with MDD and 12 controls), using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Significant diagnostic differences in DNA methylation were observed at 363 CpG sites in the discovery set. All of these loci demonstrated lower DNA methylation in patients with MDD than in the controls, and most of them (85.7%) were located in the CGIs in the gene promoter regions. We were able to distinguish patients with MDD from the control subjects with high accuracy in the discriminant analysis using the top DNA methylation markers. We also validated these selected DNA methylation markers in the replication set. Our results indicate that multiplex DNA methylation markers may be useful for distinguishing patients with MDD from non-psychiatric controls.",4.78,833

Numerous studies have shown an association between bulimia nervosa (BN) and variations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF has also been linked to borderline personality disorder (BPD) and to such traits as reward dependence. We examined the extent to which BDNF methylation corresponded to bulimic or normal-eater status, and also to the presence of comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) and childhood abuse. Our sample consisted of 64 women with BN and 32 normal-eater (NE) control women. Participants were assessed for eating-disorder symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, and childhood trauma, and then they were required to provide blood samples for methylation analyses. We observed a significant sitexgroup (BN vs. NE) interaction indicating that women with BN showed increases in methylation at specific regions of the BDNF promoter. Furthermore, examining effects of childhood abuse and BPD, we observed significant sitexgroup interactions such that groups composed of individuals with childhood abuse or BPD had particularly high levels of methylation at selected CpG sites. Our findings suggest that BN, especially when co-occurring with childhood abuse or BPD, is associated with a propensity towards elevated methylation at specific BDNF promoter region sites. These findings imply that hypermethylation of the BDNF gene may be related to eating disorder status, developmental stress exposure, and comorbid psychopathology.",3.689,1281

In cancers, tumor suppressive microRNAs may be silenced by DNA hypermethylation. By microRNA profiling of representative EBV-negative MCL cell lines before and after demethylation treatment, miR-155-3p was found significantly restored. Methylation-specific PCR, verified by pyrosequencing, showed complete methylation of miR-155-3p in one MCL cell line (REC-1). 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of REC-1 led to demethylation and re-expression of miR-155-3p. Over-expression of miR-155-3p led to increased sub-G1 apoptotic cells and reduced cellular viability, demonstrating its tumor suppressive properties. By luciferase assay, lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta) was validated as a miR-155-3p target. In 31 primary MCL, miR-155-3p was found hypermethylated in 6(19%) cases. To test if methylation of miR-155-3p was MCL-specific, miR-155-3p methylation was tested in an additional 191 B-cell, T-cell and NK-cell NHLs, yielding miR-155-3p methylation in 66(34.6%) including 36(27%) non-MCL B-cell, 24(53%) T-cell and 6(46%) of NK-cell lymphoma. Moreover, in 72 primary NHL samples with RNA, miR-155-3p methylation correlated with miR-155-3p downregulation (p=0.024), and LT-beta upregulation (p=0.043). Collectively, miR-155-3p is a potential tumor suppressive microRNA hypermethylated in MCL and other NHL subtypes. As miR-155-3p targets LT-beta, which is an upstream activator of the non-canonical NF-kB signaling, miR-155-3p methylation is potentially important in lymphomagenesis.",6.359,1713

Clustering of DNA methylation and gene expression of primary SCLC revealed distinct disease subtypes among histologically indistinguishable primary patient samples with similar genetic alterations. SCLC is notable for dense clustering of high-level methylation in discrete promoter CpG islands, in a pattern clearly distinct from other lung cancers and strongly correlated with high expression of the E2F target and histone methyltransferase gene EZH2.

Skeletal muscle stem cells are required for the growth, maintenance, and regeneration of skeletal muscle. To investigate the contribution of DNA methylation to the establishment of the myogenic program, we analyzed ESCs, skeletal muscle stem cells in proliferating (myoblasts) and differentiating conditions (myotubes), and mature myofibers. About 1.000 differentially methylated regions were identified during muscle-lineage determination and terminal differentiation, mainly located in gene bodies and intergenic regions. As a whole, myogenic stem cells showed a gain of DNA methylation, while muscle differentiation was accompanied by loss of DNA methylation in CpG-poor regions. Notably, the hypomethylated regions in myogenic stem cells were neighbored by enhancer-type chromatin, suggesting the involvement of DNA methylation in the regulation of cell-type specific enhancers. Interestingly, we demonstrated the hypomethylation of the muscle cell-identity Myf5 super-enhancer only in muscle cells. Furthermore, we observed that upstream stimulatory factor 1 binding to Myf5 super-enhancer occurs upon DNA demethylation in myogenic stem cells. Taken altogether, we characterized the unique DNA methylation signature of skeletal muscle stem cells and highlighted the importance of DNA methylation-mediated regulation of cell identity Myf5 super-enhancer during cellular differentiation.",0,335

METHODS: Real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) was used to investigate the methylation status of the CDH1 gene promoter 5'-CpG islands from intraoperative abdominal lavage fluid in 102 patients with colorectal cancer. The associations between methylation of CDH1 genes and clinicopathologic features and prognosis were investigated. RESULTS: Among the 102 colorectal cancer patients, aberrant methylation of CDH1 gene was detected in 47 patients. Significant associations were found between CDH1 methylation status and tumor size, growth pattern, differentiation, distant metastasis, and clinical staging (all P<0.05). The median progression-free survival was 25.98 months for CDH1 methylation group and 41.36 months for non-methylated group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). Cox model analysis revealed that CDH1 methylation status in intraoperative peritoneal lavage fluid was an independent factor associated with postoperative survival in colorectal cancer patients (50.23% vs. 86.51%, P=0.001).

To clarify whether exposure to 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) affects histone and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) modifications and the level of DNA methylation in the 5' regulatory region, we conducted reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using X. laevis cultured cells and premetamorphic tadpoles treated with or without 2 nM T3. Exposure to T3 increased the amount of the thrb transcript, in parallel with enhanced histone H4 acetylation and RNAPII recruitment, and probably phosphorylation of RNAPII at serine 5, in the 5' regulatory and exon b regions. However, the 5' regulatory region remained hypermethylated even with exposure to T3, and there was no significant difference in the methylation status between DNAs from T3-untreated and -treated cultured cells or tadpole tissues.

The relationships between methylation status and clinical, biological, endoscopic and histological activities were evaluated. Twenty-three of the 38 patients had a second colonoscopy and were included in a longitudinal analysis. Numerical results were given as the means +/- SD of the sample and range, except when specified. Student t analysis, U Mann Whitney and ANOVA factor were used to compare the means. Qualitative results were based on the chi(2) test. RESULTS: SLIT2 methylation was more frequent in samples with endoscopic activity than with endoscopic remission (55% vs 18%, P < 0.001). SLIT2 methylation was also higher in samples with acute inflammation (56.5%) than in samples with chronic (24%) or absent inflammation (15%) (P < 0.001). For TGFB2 methylation, the correlation was only significant with endoscopic activity. Methylation was higher in the distal colon for both genes (P < 0.001 for SLIT2 and P = 0.022 for TGFB2). In the multivariate analysis, only inflammation status (and not disease duration or extension) was independently associated with SLIT2 methylation [OR = 6.6 (95%CI: 1.65-27.36), P = 0.009].

Five years later, a recurrent tumor at the edge of the resection cavity was removed, and the tissue underwent an intensive diagnostic workup. The first tumor was unequivocally characterized as a DNET, but neuropathological diagnostics of the recurrent tumor revealed a glioblastoma. After 6 months, another recurrent tumor was detected next to the location of the original tumor, and this was also resected. An Illumina 450 K beadchip methylation array was performed to characterize all of the tumors. The methylation profile of these tumors significantly differed from other glioblastoma and epilepsy-associated tumor profiles and revealed a DNET-like methylation profile. Thus, molecular characterization of these recurrent tumors suggests malignant transformation of a previously benign DNET. We found increased copy number changes in the recurrent DNET tumors after malignant transformation.

In this study we have identified multiple DNA regulatory elements in the 5' end of the gene encoding hNHEDC1 (SLC9B1) and have explored the role that DNA methylation at these elements plays in the regulation of its expression. We first show that the full-length hNHEDC1 protein is testis-specific for the tissues that we tested and that it localizes to the cells of the seminiferous tubules. In silico analysis of the SLC9B1 gene locus identified two putative promoters (P1 and P2) and two CpG islands - CpGI (overlapping with P1) and CpGII (intragenic) - at the 5' end of the gene. By deletion analysis of P1, we show that the region from -23 bp to +200 bp relative to the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for optimal promoter activity in a germ cell line. Additionally, in vitro methylation of the P1 (the -500 bp to +200 bp region relative to the TSS) abolishes its activity in germ cells and somatic cells strongly suggesting that DNA methylation at this promoter could regulate SLC9B1 expression. Furthermore, bisulfite-sequencing analysis of the P1/CpGI uncovered reduced methylation in the testis vs. lung whereas CpGII displayed no differences in methylation between these two tissues. Additionally, treatment of HEK 293 cells with 5-aza-2-Deoxycytidine led to upregulation of NHEDC1 transcript and reduced methylation in the promoter CpGI. Finally, we have uncovered both enhancer and silencer functions of the intragenic SLC9B1 CpGII. In all, our data suggests that SLC9B1 gene expression could be regulated via a concerted action of DNA methylation-dependent and independent mechanisms mediated by these multiple DNA regulatory elements.",2.138,385

Here we find that the histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 methylates histone H2AX on lysine 134. When H2AX was mutated to abolish K134 methylation, the level of gamma-H2AX became significantly reduced. We also found lower gamma-H2AX activity following the introduction of double-strand breaks in Suv39h2 knockout cells or on SUV39H2 knockdown. Tissue microarray analyses of clinical lung and bladder tissues also revealed a positive correlation between H2AX K134 methylation and gamma-H2AX levels. Furthermore, introduction of K134-substituted histone H2AX enhanced radio- and chemosensitivity of cancer cells. Overall, our results suggest that H2AX methylation plays a role in the regulation of gamma-H2AX abundance in cancer.",11.47,1520
25086586,Aberrant methylation of PCDH10 predicts worse biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.,"['Wang L', 'Xie PG', 'Lin YL', 'Ma JG', 'Li WP']","Medical science monitor : international medical journal of
 experimental and clinical research",2014,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men, and inevitably some patients experience biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. To date, there are no reliable predictors for prostate cancer recurrence, and novel predictors are urgently needed. PCDH10 (protocadherin-10) is a novel tumor suppressor gene, which is down-regulated by promoter methylation in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using PCDH10 methylation to predict the biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. MATERIAL/METHODS: Fresh tissue samples were obtained from 151 patients with primary prostate cancer, and from 34 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as control. The methylation status of PCDH10 in prostate cancer tissues and controls were examined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and then associated with clinicopathological features and BCR-free survival of patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: We found that PCDH10 methylation was detected in 79 (52.3%) patients with prostate cancer, but no methylation was found in controls (P<0.0001). Moreover, PCDH10 methylation was significantly associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (P <0.0001), higher Gleason Score (P<0.0001), advanced clinical stage (P=0.0002), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0389), angiolymphatic invasion (P=0.0303), and biochemical recurrence (P=0.0068). Moreover, PCDH10 methylation was associated with poor BCR-free survival (P<0.0001), and may be used as an independent predictor of BCR-free survival (P=0.0046). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PCDH10 methylation in prostate cancer tissue is an independent prognostic biomarker of worse BCR-free survival of patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.",1.433,1995
27452040,Development of a multiplex MethyLight assay for the detection of DAPK1 and SOX1 methylation in epithelial ovarian cancer in a north Indian population.,[],Genes & genetic systems,2016,"Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. It is very heterogeneous at the clinical, histopathological and molecular levels and is caused by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in regulatory genes. More than 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin. Ovarian cancer is typically asymptomatic in its early stages, and due to difficulties in early detection, most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The positive predictive value of CA-125, a routinely used serum protein marker is \\< 30%; therefore, for effective screening, there is a need to develop a marker with high sensitivity for early detection. Development of blood-based biomarkers that detect DNA methylation in cell-free tumor-specific DNA is now being considered as a potential approach for the early diagnosis of cancer. Our objective in this study was to develop an absolute quantitative method, the MethyLight assay, to detect the promoter methylation status of two tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed the methylation level of the promoter regions of these genes in 42 tumor samples using the MethyLight assay. SOX1 promoter methylation was significantly higher in cancer samples than in normal samples (P = 0.011), whereas this difference between cancer and normal samples was not significant for DAPK1 promoter methylation (P = 0.18), when analyzed separately in a singleplex assay, whereas the detection frequency and significance level increased several-fold when these genes were analyzed together in a multiplex assay (P = 0.0004).The sensitivity was found to be 62% and 83% for DAPK1 and SOX1, respectively, when analyzed separately in the singleplex assay, but increased to 90% in the multiplex assay when either the SOX1 or the DAPK1 gene promoters showed methylation.",0.93,1987

DNA methylation as an important environment-induced mechanism could serve as a potential link between embryos' phenotypic variability and temperature variation, which reprogrammed by DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases (DNMTS) and Methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBPS) 3&5 (MBD3&5). Five genes in DNMTS and MBPS gene families were selected as target genes, given their important role in epigenetic modification. In this study, we aimed to test whether raising incubation temperature from 37.8 degrees C to 38.8 degrees C between embryonic days (ED) 1-10, ED10-20 and ED20-27 have effect on DNA methylation and whether DNMTS, MBPS play roles in thermal epigenetic regulation of early development in duck. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that increased incubation temperature by 1 degrees C has remarkably dynamic effect on gene expression levels of DNMTS and MBPS. Slight changes in incubation temperature significantly increased mRNA levels of target genes in breast muscle tissue during ED1-10, especially for DNMT1, DNMT3A and MBD5. In addition, higher temperature significantly increased enzyme activities of DNMT1 in leg muscle during ED10-20, liver tissue during ED1-10, ED20-27 and DNMT3A in leg muscle and breast muscle tissue during ED10-20. These results suggest that incubation temperature has an extended effect on gene expression levels and enzyme activities of DNMTS and MBPS, which provides evidence that incubation temperature may influence DNA methylation in duck during early developmental stages. Our data indicated that DNMTS and MBPS may involved in thermal epigenetice regulation of embryos during the early development in duck. The potential links between embryonic temperature and epigenetic modification need further investigation.",1.672,983

Thus it is important to define epigenetic alterations in asthmatic populations. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that epigenetic alterations in circulating PBMCs are associated with allergic asthma. METHODS: We compared DNA methylation patterns and gene expression in inner-city children with persistent atopic asthma versus healthy control subjects by using DNA and RNA from PBMCs. Results were validated in an independent population of asthmatic patients. RESULTS: Comparing asthmatic patients (n = 97) with control subjects (n = 97), we identified 81 regions that were differentially methylated. Several immune genes were hypomethylated in asthma, including IL13, RUNX3, and specific genes relevant to T lymphocytes (TIGIT). Among asthmatic patients, 11 differentially methylated regions were associated with higher serum IgE concentrations, and 16 were associated with percent predicted FEV1. Hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions were associated with increased and decreased gene expression, respectively (P < 6 x 10(-12) for asthma and P < .01 for IgE). We further explored the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression using an integrative analysis and identified additional candidates relevant to asthma (IL4 and ST2). Methylation marks involved in T-cell maturation (RUNX3), TH2 immunity (IL4), and oxidative stress (catalase) were validated in an independent asthmatic cohort of children living in the inner city. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation marks in specific gene loci are associated with asthma and suggest that epigenetic changes might play a role in establishing the immune phenotype associated with asthma.",0,844

Has-miR-34b was transfected into K562 cells, which were divided into non-transfection group, negative control group and Has-miR-34b transfection group; if the transfection was successful, the cell proliferation should be recorded at different time points of culture, and the proliferation inhibition rate should be calculated. RESULTS: The relative expression level of miR-34b in the control group was (5.23 +/- 0.75), in HL-60 was (0.05 +/- 0.01) and in K562 was (0.04 +/- 0.01). The difference between 3 groups was statistically significant (F = 44.812, P < 0.01). The promoter regions of CpG island in HL-60 and K562 cell lines were methylated, while the bone marrow cells were not methylated in 10 cases of non hematologic diseases children.Through miR-34b expression levels of HL-60 and K562 cell lines significantly increased by decitabine treatment (P < 0.05), and the methylation of leukemia cell line promoter region CpG island was found before and after decitabine treatment, but after administration of decitabine the methylation significantly decreased, suggesting that decitabine has an inhibitory effect on methylation of promoter region CpG island. After being cultured for 48, 72, 96 and 120 hrs, the cell proliferation in Has-miR-34b transfection group reached to 24.8%, 46.7%, 33.6% and 4.7%, repectively, and significantly lower than that in non transfection group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CpG island methylation of miR-34b promoter region in leukemia cell lines can decrease the expression levels of miR-34b, which is also the reason why miR-34b can reduce the inhibition of cell proliferation, thus miR-34b might be a tumor suppressor gene involved in the regulation of leukemia.",0,287

Here, TERT methylation was investigated in tumor and paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANT) from 185 ESCC patients, and the expression of TERT was investigated in 26 tumors paired with ANTs selected from the same cohort. The methylation level of TERT was analyzed in three different regions: region 1, region 2, and the UTSS region. Comparison and correlation of methylation level and clinical features were analyzed in the abovementioned regions. The results showed that the methylation level of TERT was significantly elevated in the tumor relative to the ANT in ESCC. TERT RNA expression was significantly reduced in primary tumors.

This study aims to investigate the methylation status of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) promoter region in the endometrium of patients with uterine fibroids. The methylation of CDH1 was studied using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in the endometrial tissue of 102 patients with uterine fibroids and 50 control patients. The E-cadherin expression was examined by flow cytometry. The methylation rate of CDH1 promoter region was 33.3% in the endometrium of patients with uterine fibroids and 8% in the endometrium of women without fibroids. The frequency of CDH1 promoter methylation in the endometrium of patients with fibroids was significantly higher than that in the endometrium of women without fibroids (P = .001). Furthermore, the E-cadherin expression level in methylation-positive tissues was significantly lower than that in methylation-negative tissues (P = .017).

The insulin independent glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) plays a key role in brain metabolism while the insulin-dependent GLUT4 is the major glucose transporter for skeletal and cardiac muscle. We therefore examined methylation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in fifty-two depressed inpatients and compared data to eighteen healthy comparison subjects. DNA methylation of the core promoter regions of GLUT1 and GLUT4 was assessed by bisulfite sequencing. Further factors determined were fasting glucose, cortisol, insulin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We found significantly increased methylation of the GLUT1 in depressed inpatients compared to healthy comparison subjects (CG). Further findings comprise increased concentrations of fasting cortisol, glucose, insulin, and increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha. After six weeks of inpatient treatment, significantly lower GLUT1 methylation was observed in remitted patients compared to non-remitters. GLUT4 methylation was not different between depressed patients and CG, and did not differ between remitted and non-remitted patients. Although preliminary we conclude from our results that the acute phase of major depressive disorder is associated with increased GLUT1 methylation and mild insulin resistance. The successful treatment of depression is associated with normalization of GLUT1 methylation in remitters, indicating that this condition may be reversible. Failure of normalization of GLUT1 methylation in non-remitters may point to a possible role of impeded brain glucose metabolism in the maintenance of MDD.",3.957,1123

Recent studies with other metal antigens suggest epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in inflammatory disease processes, including granulomatous lung disorders and that a number of metal cations alter gene methylation. The objective of this study was to determine if Be can exert an epigenetic effect on gene expression by altering methylation in the promoter region of specific genes known to be involved in Be antigen-mediated gene expression. To investigate this objective, three macrophage tumor mouse cell lines known to differentially produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but not interferon (IFN)-gamma, in response to Be antigen were cultured with Be or controls. Following challenges, ELISA were performed to quantify induced TNFalpha and IFNgamma expression. Bisulfate-converted DNA was evaluated by pyrosequencing to quantify CpG methylation within the promoters of TNFalpha and IFNgamma. Be-challenged H36.12J cells expressed higher levels of TNFalpha compared to either H36.12E cells or P388D.1 cells. However, there were no variations in TNFalpha promoter CpG methylation levels between cell lines at the six CpG sites tested. H36.12J cell TNFalpha expression was shown to be metal-specific by the induction of significantly more TNFalpha when exposed to Be than when exposed to aluminum sulfate, or nickel (II) chloride, but not when exposed to cobalt (II) chloride. However, H36.12J cell methylation levels at the six CpG sites examined in the TNFalpha promoter did not correlate with cytokine expression differences. Nonetheless, all three cell lines had significantly more promoter methylation at the six CpG sites investigated within the IFNgamma promoter (a gene that is not expressed) when compared to the six CpG sites investigated in the TNFalpha promoter, regardless of treatment condition (p < 1.17 x 10(-9)). These findings suggest that, in this cell system, promoter hypo-methylation may be necessary to allow expression of metal-induced TNFalpha and that promoter hyper-methylation in the IFNgamma promoter may interfere with expression. Also, at the dozen CpG sites investigated in the promoter regions of both genes, beryllium had no impact on promoter methylation status, despite its ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.",2.054,692

For other hormones it has been shown that the induction of such transcriptional effects is conferred or at least accompanied by DNA-methylation changes. To analyse effects of short term rhGH treatment on the DNA-methylome we investigated a total of 24 patients at baseline and after 4-day rhGH stimulation. We performed array-based DNA-methylation profiling of paired peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples followed by targeted validation using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Unsupervised analysis of DNA-methylation in this short-term treated cohort revealed clustering according to individuals rather than treatment. Supervised analysis identified 239 CpGs as significantly differentially methylated between baseline and rhGH-stimulated samples (p<0.0001, unadjusted paired t-test), which nevertheless did not retain significance after adjustment for multiple testing. An individualized evaluation strategy led to the identification of 2350 CpG and 3 CpH sites showing methylation differences of at least 10% in more than 2 of the 24 analyzed sample pairs. To investigate the long term effects of rhGH treatment on the DNA-methylome, we analyzed peripheral blood cells from an independent cohort of 36 rhGH treated children born small for gestational age (SGA) as compared to 18 untreated controls. Median treatment interval was 33 months. In line with the groupwise comparison in the short-term treated cohort no differentially methylated targets reached the level of significance in the long-term treated cohort. We identified marked intra-individual responses of DNA-methylation to short-term rhGH treatment. These responses seem to be predominately associated with immunologic functions and show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity. The latter is likely the cause for the lack of a rhGH induced homogeneous DNA-methylation signature after short- and long-term treatment, which nevertheless is well in line with generally assumed safety of rhGH treatment.",3.234,1595

Calculation of epi-population structure and kinships assigned individuals into subsets (K=3), revealing that the natural population of P. simonii consists of three subpopulations. Population epigenetic distance and geographic distance showed a significant correlation (r=0.4688, P<0.001), suggesting that environmental factors may affect epigenetics. Single-marker approaches were also used to identify significant marker-trait associations, which found 1087 high-confidence DNA methylation markers associated with different phenotypic traits explaining ~5-15% of the phenotypic variance. Among these loci, 147 differentially methylated fragments were obtained by sequencing, representing 130 candidate genes. Expression analysis of six candidate genes indicated that these genes might play important roles in leaf development and regulation of photosynthesis.

To gain insight into the meaning of 2-methylhopanes, we quantified the dominant (des)methylated hopanoid species in the membranes of the model hopanoid-producing bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1. Fluorescence polarization studies of small unilamellar vesicles revealed that hopanoid 2-methylation specifically renders native bacterial membranes more rigid at concentrations that are relevant in vivo. That hopanoids differentially modify native membrane rigidity as a function of their methylation state indicates that methylation itself promotes fitness under stress. Moreover, knowing the in vivo (2Me)-hopanoid concentration range in different cell membranes, and appreciating that (2Me)-hopanoids' biophysical effects are tuned by the lipid environment, permits the design of more relevant in vitro experiments to study their physiological functions.",9.322,1418

Within the ~3.7 Mb imprinted Angelman/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) domain, 254 CpG sites were interrogated for changes in methylation due to PWS-IC deletion. Paternally-inherited deletion of the PWS-IC increased methylation levels ~2-fold at each CpG site (compared to wild-type controls) at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with 5' CpG island promoters of paternally-expressed genes; these methylation changes extended, to a variable degree, into the adjacent CpG island shores. Maternal PWS-IC deletion yielded little or no changes in methylation at these DMRs, and methylation of CpG sites outside of promoter DMRs also was unchanged upon maternal or paternal PWS-IC deletion. Using stringent ascertainment criteria, ~750,000 additional CpG sites were also interrogated across the entire mouse genome. This analysis identified 26 loci outside of the imprinted AS/PWS domain showing altered DNA methylation levels of >/=25% upon PWS-IC deletion. Curiously, altered methylation at 9 of these loci was a consequence of maternal PWS-IC deletion (maternal PWS-IC deletion by itself is not known to be associated with a phenotype in either humans or mice), and 10 of these loci exhibited the same changes in methylation irrespective of the parental origin of the PWS-IC deletion. These results suggest that the PWS-IC may affect DNA methylation at these loci by directly interacting with them, or may affect methylation at these loci through indirect downstream effects due to PWS-IC deletion. They further suggest the PWS-IC may have a previously uncharacterized function outside of the imprinted AS/PWS domain.",4.78,1077

The aim of this study was to evaluate DNA methylation in mandibular head cartilage in different phases of experimentally-induced TMJOA in rats. DESIGN: DNA methylation was evaluated using microarrays in the mandibular head cartilage of early, intermediate and late stage experimentally-induced TMJOA, and of the normal age-matched control groups. Genes with differentially methylated CpG sites were analyzed to reveal the over-represented gene ontologies and pathways at different stages, and were compared with published expression profiles to assess their overlappings. The DNA methylation patterns of the target genes were validated by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation qPCR in additional independent cartilage samples and mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We observed 9489 differentially methylated regions between the TMJOA and controls. A total of 440 consistently altered genes were revealed in all three stages; most (80%) were hypomethylated and many were associated with cell cycle regulation. We also detected different DNA methylation changes in early and late stage TMJOA (Rearly=0.68, Rlate=0.47), while the differences between age-matched healthy cartilage were subtle. Strong inverse changes between methylation status and mRNA levels were confirmed in Adamts5, Chad, Cldn11 and Tnf. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveals dynamic DNA methylation patterns during the progression of TMJOA, with a different host of genes and pathways. The changes of cartilage DNA methylation patterns might contribute to understand the etiologic mechanisms of TMJOA epigenetically.",1.735,435

The effects of aging were evaluated by comparing young adult (90-day-old) and middle-aged (450-day-old) female Wistar rats. To elucidate the effects of environmental enrichment, a subgroup of middle-aged rats exposed to sensory and social stimulation for 105 days was compared to rats housed under standard laboratory conditions. Aging decreased the transcription of neurosteroidogenic-related genes and increased the promoter methylation state of cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD) and 5alpha-reductase-1. Exposure of middle-aged rats to environmental enrichment increased mRNA levels of 5alpha-reductase-1, 3alpha-HSD and cytochrome P450 17alpha-hydroxylase/c17,20-lyase and decreased the methylation state of the 5alpha-reductase-1 gene. Thus, sensory and social stimulation attenuate the age-related decline in the mRNA expression of hippocampal steroidogenic enzymes.

Epigenetic factors have emerged as one potential mechanism that account for how trauma exposure leads to sustained PTSD symptoms given that PTSD develops in only a subset of trauma survivors. METHODS: Cytosine methylation of a relevant promoter of the GR gene (NR3C1-1F promoter) and three functional neuroendocrine markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function were examined in a sample of 122 combat veterans. RESULTS: Lower NR3C1-1F promoter methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was observed in combat veterans with PTSD compared with combat-exposed veterans who did not develop PTSD. NR3C1-1F promoter methylation was also associated with three functional measures of glucocorticoid activity that have been associated with PTSD in combat veterans: PBMCs' lysozyme inhibition on the lysozyme suppression test, plasma cortisol decline on the low-dose (.50 mg) dexamethasone suppression test, and 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion. Finally, NR3C1-1F promoter methylation was inversely correlated with clinical markers and symptoms associated with PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in NR3C1-1F promoter methylation may reflect enduring changes resulting from combat exposure that lead to functional neuroendocrine alterations. Because epigenetic measures are thought to reflect enduring effects of environmental exposures, they may be useful in distinguishing combat-exposed veterans who do or do not develop PTSD.",10.255,1060

Silencing of PRDM5 by promoter hypermethylation has been demonstrated in several cancer types and PRDM5 loss results in upregulation of the Wnt pathway and increased cellular proliferation. PRDM5 has not been extensively investigated in specific subtypes of colorectal cancers. We hypothesized it would be more commonly methylated and inactivated in serrated pathway colorectal cancers that are hallmarked by a BRAF V600E mutation and a methylator phenotype, compared to traditional pathway cancers that are BRAF wild type. METHODS: Cancer (214 BRAF mutant, 122 BRAF wild type) and polyp (59 serrated polyps, 40 conventional adenomas) cohorts were analysed for PRDM5 promoter methylation using MethyLight technology. PRDM5 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in cancers and polyps. Mutation of PRDM5 was analysed using cBioPortal's publicly available database. RESULTS: BRAF mutant cancers had significantly more frequent PRDM5 promoter methylation than BRAF wild type cancers (77/214,36% vs 4/122,3%; p<0.0001). Serrated type polyps had a lower methylation rate than cancers but were more commonly methylated than conventional adenomas (6/59,10% vs 0/40,0%). PRDM5 methylation was associated with advanced stages of presentation (p<0.05) and the methylator phenotype (p=0.03). PRDM5 protein expression was substantially down-regulated in both BRAF mutant and wild type cancer cohorts (92/97,95% and 39/44,89%). The polyp subgroups showed less silencing than the cancers, but similar rates were found between the serrated and conventional polyp cohorts (29/59, 49%; 23/40, 58% respectively). Of 295 colorectal cancers, PRDM5 was mutated in only 6 (2%) cancers which were all BRAF wild type. CONCLUSIONS: Serrated pathway colorectal cancers demonstrated early and progressive PRDM5 methylation with advancing disease. Interestingly, PRDM5 protein expression was substantially reduced in all polyp types and more so in cancers which also indicates early and increasing PRDM5 down-regulation with disease progression. Methylation may be contributing to gene silencing in a proportion of BRAF mutant cancers, but the large extent of absent protein expression indicates other mechanisms are also responsible for this. These data suggest that PRDM5 is a relevant tumour suppressor gene that is frequently targeted in colorectal tumourigenesis.",3.362,1597

Here we obtain new insights into non-histone lysine methylation and protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) activity by elucidating absolute stoichiometries of lysine methylation, using mass spectrometry and absolute quantification (AQUA), in wild-type and 5 PKMT gene deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By analyzing 8 sites of methylation in 3 non-histone proteins, elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1alpha), elongation factor 2 (EF2), and 60S ribosomal protein L42-A/B (Rpl42ab), we find that production of preferred methylation states on individual lysine residues is commonplace and likely occurs through processive PKMT activity, Class I PKMTs can be associated with processive methylation, lysine residues are selectively methylated by specific PKMTs, and lysine methylation exists over a broad range of stoichiometries. Together these findings suggest that specific sites and forms of lysine methylation may play specialized roles in the regulation of non-histone protein activity. We also uncover new relationships between two proteins previously characterized as PKMTs, SEE1 and EFM1, in EF1alpha methylation and show that past characterizations of EFM1 as having direct PKMT activity may require reinterpretation.",4.245,941

OBJECTIVES: Here we tested for the relationship of paternal sperm DNA methylation with autism risk in offspring, examining an enriched-risk cohort of fathers of autistic children. METHODS: We examined genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in paternal semen biosamples obtained from an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enriched-risk pregnancy cohort, the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) cohort, to estimate associations between sperm DNAm and prospective ASD development, using a 12-month ASD symptoms assessment, the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI). We analysed methylation data from 44 sperm samples run on the CHARM 3.0 array, which contains over 4 million probes (over 7 million CpG sites), including 30 samples also run on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip platform ( approximately 485 000 CpG sites). We also examined associated regions in an independent sample of post-mortem human brain ASD and control samples for which Illumina 450K DNA methylation data were available. RESULTS: Using region-based statistical approaches, we identified 193 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in paternal sperm with a family-wise empirical P-value [family-wise error rate (FWER)] <0.05 associated with performance on the Autism Observational Scale for Infants (AOSI) at 12 months of age in offspring. The DMRs clustered near genes involved in developmental processes, including many genes in the SNORD family, within the Prader-Willi syndrome gene cluster. These results were consistent among the 75 probes on the Illumina 450K array that cover AOSI-associated DMRs from CHARM. Further, 18 of 75 (24%) 450K array probes showed consistent differences in the cerebellums of autistic individuals compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that epigenetic differences in paternal sperm may contribute to autism risk in offspring, and provide evidence that directionally consistent, potentially related epigenetic mechanisms may be operating in the cerebellum of individuals with autism.",9.176,378

This study was to examine the association of blood leukocyte DNA methylation of the 2 CpGs in IL-6 with the risk of IHD and the serum IL-6 level. Methods IL-6 methylation levels of 582 cases and 673 controls were measured using the bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. Serum level of IL-6 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The IL-6 methylation was significantly lower in IHD cases than in the controls, irrespective of CpG site. After multivariate adjustment, lower (< median) average IL-6 methylation was associated with an increased risk of IHD (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.22-2.02, p < 0.001). Average IL-6 methylation level was inversely associated with serum IL-6 level (beta = -1.02 pg/mL per increase in IL-6 methylation, p = 0.002) among IHD cases. This significant relationship was not observed among controls. Conclusions DNA hypomethylation of IL-6 gene measured in blood leukocytes was associated with increased risk of IHD.

Relevant evidence shows that the promoter methylation of RAS association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) gene, a tumor suppressor gene, has a close relationship with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development; therefore, RASSF1A may be a potential NSCLC biomarker. This paper discussed and summarized the relationship between RASSF1A gene promoter methylation frequency and NSCLC through meta-analysis. METHODS: By searching Medline, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang database, we selected and collected the published articles regarding RASSF1A gene promoter methylation and NSCLC risk according to the marked inclusion and exclusion criteria. Through meta-analysis, combined odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) data were used to analyze the RASSF1A gene promoter methylation and NSCLC relationship. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were utilized in this study. Results indicated that the RASSF1A gene promoter methylation rate was 41.50% (95%CI: 34%-49%) in NSCLC tissue and was 5.58% (95%CI: 2%-9%) for the control group. Compared with normal lung tissue, RASSF1A methylation frequency in tumor tissue was significantly higher than that of the control group (OR=8.72, 95%CI: 4.88-15.58, P<0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that the RASSF1A gene promoter methylation rate of tumor tissue was higher than that of plasma group (OR=10.99, 95%CI: 2.48-48.68) and normal control tissue group (OR=8.74, 95%CI: 4.39-17.41). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of RASSF1A promoter gene methylation in NSCLC patient tissue samples was higher than that of normal lung samples, whereas the rate of RASSF1A promoter gene methylation in the tissue has more significant effect on lung cancer occurrence. This finding indicates that RASSF1A gene promoter methylation could be used as an NSCLC biomarker and was involved in NSCLC carcinogenic effects.",0,407

RESULTS: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples on 75 patients (21 White, 31 African-American, and 23 Hispanic) (training dataset) enrolled in the BCCC. Hormone receptor status was defined as negative if tumors were negative for both estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR) receptors (N = 22/75). DNA methylation was analyzed at 1505 CpG sites within 807 gene promoters using the Illumina GoldenGate assay. Differential DNA methylation as a predictor of hormone receptor status was tested while controlling for false discovery rate and assigned to the gene closest to the respective CpG site. Next, those genes that predicted ER/PR status were validated using TCGA data with respect to DNA methylation (validation dataset), and correlations between CpG methylation and gene expression were examined. In the training dataset, 5.7 % of promoter mean methylation values (46/807) were associated with receptor status at P < 0.05; for 88 % of these (38/46), hypermethylation was associated with receptor-positive disease. Hypermethylation for FZD9, MME, BCAP31, HDAC9, PAX6, SCGB3A1, PDGFRA, IGFBP3, and PTGS2 genes most strongly predicted receptor-positive disease. Twenty-one of 24 predictor genes from the training dataset were confirmed in the validation dataset. The level of DNA methylation at 19 out 22 genes, for which gene expression data were available, was associated with gene activity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of promoter methylation strongly correlate with hormone receptor positive status of breast tumors. For most of the genes identified in our training dataset as ER/PR receptor status predictors, DNA methylation correlated with stable gene expression level. The predictors performed well when evaluated on independent set of samples, with different racioethnic distribution, thus providing evidence that this set of DNA methylation biomarkers will likely generalize to prospective patient samples.",4.543,92

A total of 512 adult participants (126 hypertension subjects and 386 non-hypertension subjects) residing in an arsenic-endemic area in Inner Mongolia, China were included. Urinary levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were measured for all subjects. The percentage of urinary arsenic metabolites (iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%), primary methylation index (PMI) and secondary methylation index (SMI) were calculated to assess arsenic methylation capacity of individuals. Results showed that participants carrying a lower methylation capacity, which is characterized by lower DMA% and SMI, have a higher risk of hypertension compared to their corresponding references after adjusting for multiple confounders. A potential synergy between poor arsenic methylation capacity (higher MMA%, lower DMA% and SMI) and older age or higher BMI were detected. The joint effects of higher MMA% and lower SMI with cigarette smoking also suggest some evidence of synergism. The findings of present study indicated that inefficient arsenic methylation capacity was associated with hypertension and the effect might be enhanced by certain demographic factors.",2.063,85

Methylation by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) under sulfate-reducing conditions is probably one of the most important sources of MMHg in natural aquatic environments, but its influence on natural Hg isotopic composition remains to be ascertained. In this context, the methylating SRB Desulfovibrio dechloracetivorans (strain BerOc1) was incubated under sulfate reducing and fumarate respiration conditions (SR and FR, respectively) to determine Hg species specific (MMHg and IHg) isotopic composition associated with methylation and demethylation kinetics. Our results clearly establish Hg isotope mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) during biotic methylation (-1.20 to +0.58 per thousand for delta(202)Hg), but insignificant mass-independent fractionation (MIF) (-0.12 to +0.15 per thousand for Delta(201)Hg). During the 24h of the time-course experiments Hg isotopic composition in the produced MMHg becomes significantly lighter than the residual IHg after 1.5h and shows similar delta(202)Hg values under both FR and SR conditions at the end of the experiments. This suggests a unique pathway responsible for the MDF of Hg isotopes during methylation by this strain regardless the metabolism of the cells. After 9 h of experiment, significant simultaneous demethylation is occurring in the culture and demethylates preferentially the lighter Hg isotopes of MMHg. Therefore, depending on their methylation/demethylation capacities, SRB communities in natural sulfate reducing conditions likely have a significant and specific influence on the Hg isotope composition of MMHg (MDF) in sediments and aquatic organisms.",5.33,179

Moreover, enhancer methylation correlates with target gene expression better than promoter methylation, providing unexplored strategies for biomarker development. Here, we review important considerations associated with the clinical analysis of DNA methylation at distal regulatory regions. Notably, we highlight emerging literature addressing the methylation status of enhancers in development and cancer, and subsequently discuss how enhancer methylation can be exploited to guide disease management.

We have studied the DNA methylation status of 27 500 gene promoter regions in 24 gastric adenocarcinomas from a Norwegian cohort, and aimed at identifying the hypermethylated regions. We have compared our findings to the gene expression in the same tissue, and linked our results to prognosis and survival. METHODS: Biopsies from gastric adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal gastric mucosa were obtained from 24 patients following surgical resection of the tumor. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of the tumor and matched non-cancerous mucosa was performed. The results were compared to whole transcriptome cDNA microarray analysis of the same material. RESULTS: Most of the gene promoter regions in both types of tissue showed a low degree of methylation, however there was a small, but significant hypermethylation of the tumors. Hierarchical clustering showed separate grouping of the tumor and normal tissue. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the GFRA3 gene showed a strong correlation to post-operative survival and several of the clinicopathological parameters, however no difference was found between the two main histological types of gastric cancer. There was only a modest correlation between the DNA methylation status and gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: The different DNA methylation clusters of the tumors and normal tissue indicate that aberrant DNA methylation is a distinct feature of gastric cancer, although there is little difference in the overall, and low, methylation levels between the two tissue types. The GFRA3 promoter region showed marked hypermethylation in almost all tumors, and its correlation with survival and other clinicopathological parameters may have important prognostic significance.",3.362,962

MiR-145 methylation in NSCLC was correlated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and was associated with poor survival time, as shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additional multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-145 methylation was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, we found that restoration of miR-145 expression inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC by the direct targeting of mucin 1 by miR-145.

Profiling of DNA methylation in five maize (Zea mays) inbred lines found that while DNA methylation levels for more than 99% of the analyzed genomic regions are similar, there are still 5,000 to 20,000 context-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between any two genotypes. The analysis of identical-by-state genomic regions that have limited genetic variation provided evidence that DMRs can occur without local sequence variation, but they are less common than in regions with genetic variation. Characterization of the sequence specificity of DMRs, location of DMRs relative to genes and transposons, and patterns of DNA methylation in regions flanking DMRs reveals a distinct subset of DMRs. Transcriptome profiling of the same tissue revealed that only approximately 20% of genes with qualitative (on-off) differences in gene expression are associated with DMRs, and there is little evidence for association of DMRs with genes that show quantitative differences in gene expression. We also identify a set of genes that may represent cryptic information that is silenced by DNA methylation in the reference B73 genome.

RESULTS: Basil polysaccharide down-regulated the expression of HIF-lalpha, G9a, JMJD1A mRNA and protein and histone H3K9me2 methylation level in MHCC97H cells under hypoxic condition,and down-regulated the expression of HIF-lalpha mRNA and protein and histone H3K9me2 methylation level in MHCC97L cells under hypoxic condition(P <0. 05). CONCLUSION: Basil polysaccharide can regulate histone H3K9me2 methylation levels in hepatoma cells MHCC97H and MHCC97L which have different metastatic potential under hypoxic conditions. On hepatoma cell MHCC97H, the regulation of histone H3K9me2 methylation is associated with histone methyltransferase G9a and demethylase JMJDlA. In hepatoma cell MHCC97L, the regulation of histone H3K9me2 methylation was probably through other pathways.",0,27

We hypothesize that gene-specific CpG methylation is related to environmentally perturbed transcription factor occupancy. To test this hypothesis, a database of 396 genes with altered CpG methylation either in cord blood leukocytes or placental tissue was compiled from 14 studies representing assessments of six environmental contaminants. Subsequently, an in silico approach was used to identify transcription factor binding sites enriched among the genes with altered CpG methylation in relationship to the suite of environmental contaminants. For each study, the sequences of the promoter regions (representing -1000 to +500 bp from the transcription start site) of all genes with altered CpG methylation were analyzed for enrichment of transcription factor binding sites. Binding sites for a total of 56 unique transcription factors were identified to be enriched within the promoter regions of the genes. Binding sites for the Kidney-Enriched Krupple-like Factor 15, a known responder to endogenous stress, were enriched (P < 0.001-0.041) among the genes with altered CpG methylation associated for five of the six environmental contaminants. These data support the transcription factor occupancy theory as a potential mechanism underlying environmentally-induced gene-specific CpG methylation.",0,1303

Two sets of 85 adapter pairs were developed to concurrently identify SNPs, indels and methylation sites for 85 lines of cassava population in this study. In addition to SNPs and indels, the simplicity of the AFSM protocol makes it particularly suitable for high-throughput full methylation and hemi-methylation analyses. To further demonstrate the ease of this approach, a cassava genetic linkage map was constructed. This approach should be widely applicable for genetic mapping in a variety of organisms and will improve the application of crop genomics in assisted breeding.",5.578,892

The addiction-causing substance of tobacco smoke, nicotine, has also shown the potential to alter DNA methylation patterns. However, genetics has a strong influence on DNA methylation patterns, which in turn may affect an individual's smoking behaviour. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied eight functional gene variants of one of the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes, CYP2D6, in relation to smoking behaviour in our well-characterized study population consisting of 1230 Whites of Russian origin. In addition, potential associations between methylation levels in a CpG island in the CYP2D6 gene and sex, age, different smoking-related phenotypes and CYP2D6 genotypes were studied. RESULTS: Both age and sex were found to be associated with the methylation level of the CYP2D6 gene. The CYP2D6 methylation pattern also showed high genotype dependence; compared with the extensive metabolizer genotype, the poor metabolizer genotype occurred notably more frequently with higher methylation status (odds ratio 5.05, 95% confidence interval 2.14-11.90). Moreover, higher methylation levels were found to be related inversely to heavier smoking (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.91). We also found associations between the CYP2D6 genotype and smoking habits; the poor metabolizer genotype tended to decrease the risk of becoming a heavy smoker compared with the extensive metabolizers, whereas the ultrarapid metabolism-related genotypes tended to increase the risk. CONCLUSION: The CYP2D6-related metabolic capacity seems to be related to cigarette consumption both through genetic and through epigenetic mechanisms.",3.481,234

In humans, these technologies and/or subfertility have been linked to perturbations in genomic imprinting. To understand how assisted reproductive technologies and infertility affect DNA methylation, it is important to understand DNA methylation dynamics and the role of regulating factors at these critical stages. Recent genome studies performed using mouse and human gametes and preimplantation embryos have shed light onto these processes. Here, we comprehensively review the current state of knowledge regarding global and imprinted DNA methylation programming in the mouse and human. Available data highlight striking similarities in mouse and human DNA methylation dynamics during gamete and preimplantation development. Just as fascinating, these studies have revealed sex-, gene- and allele-specific differences in DNA methylation programming, warranting future investigation to untangle the complex regulation of DNA methylation dynamics during gamete and preimplantation development.",3.318,935

Polymorphisms in these genes have been implicated in colorectal cancer etiology; however, epigenetic modifications such as gene-specific DNA methylation also affect gene expression. DNA methylation of DNMT3B and MTHFR was quantified in blood leukocytes using Sequenom EpiTYPER(R) among 272 participants undergoing a screening colonoscopy. DNA methylation was quantified in 66 and 28CpG sites of DNMT3B and MTHFR respectively, and conceptualized using two approaches. First, measures representing average methylation across all CpG sites were created. Second, unsupervised principal component (PC) analysis was used to identify summary variables representing methylation around the transcription start site and in the gene-coding area for both DNMT3B and MTHFR. Logistic regression was used to compare methylation levels between participants diagnosed with colorectal adenoma(s) versus those with a normal colonoscopy via the estimation of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the risk of colorectal adenomas. No association was observed between average DNA methylation of either DNMT3B or MTHFR and colorectal adenoma risk. For DNMT3B, increasing DNA methylation of CpG sites in the gene-coding area was associated with a higher risk of colorectal adenomas (OR=1.34; 95% CI: 1.01-1.79 per SD). This research provides preliminary evidence that methylation of DNMT3B may have functional significance with respect to colorectal adenomas, precursors to the vast majority of colorectal cancers.",3.68,115

METHODS: The 5-methyl cytosine content was assessed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) of peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from 178 type 2 diabetes patients to determine individual global DNA methylation status. RESULTS: There was a positive significant correlation between diabetes duration and DNA methylation levels (P=0.002) with increasing levels of DNA methylation associated with age (P=0.047). There was no significant correlation between DNA methylation levels and HbA1c (P=0.15). No significant differences were observed between patients with and without diabetes predisposing factors including: hypertension (P=0.772), dyslipidemia (P=0.617), insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment index) (P=0.156) and obesity (P=0.609). As such, the duration of diabetes (>10 years) was the most important predictor of global DNA methylation levels in diabetic patients after adjusting for age and sex (P=0.023).

DNA methylation alterations in DNA damage response (DDR)-related genes have the potential to affect DEE exposure-related cancer risk. However, the evidence regarding the association between DEE exposure and methylation alterations in DDR-related genes is limited. In 117 DEE-exposed workers and 112 non-DEE-exposed workers, we measured urinary concentrations of six mono-hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs). We also determined the methylation levels of three DDR-related genes (p16, RASSF1A, and MGMT) and LINE-1 by bisulfite-pyrosequencing assay. We found that DEE-exposed workers exhibited significantly lower mean promoter methylation levels of p16, RASSF1A, and MGMT than non-DEE-exposed workers (all p < 0.001). In all study subjects and non-smoking workers, increasing quartiles of urinary summed OH-PAHs was associated with hypomethylation of p16, RASSF1A, and MGMT (all p < 0.05). In non-smoking workers, methylation in p16, RASSF1A, and MGMT decreased by 0.36 % [95 % confidential interval (CI): -0.60, -0.11 %], 0.46 % (95 % CI: -0.79, -0.14 %), and 0.55 % (95 % CI: -0.95, -0.15 %), respectively, in association with highest versus lowest quartile of urinary summed OH-PAHs. In addition, p16, RASSF1A, MGMT, and LINE-1 methylation levels showed negative correlations with cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome index which was previously measured in the same workers (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results clearly indicated that DEE exposure and increased genetic damage were associated with hypomethylation of p16, RASSF1A, and MGMT. Future studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these associations.",5.98,815

But many aspects of DNA methylation remain unexplored, including the individual roles of distal and gene body methylation, as well as their collaborative roles with promoter methylation. Here we performed a MBD-seq analysis on prostate specimens classified into low, high, and very high risk group based on Gleason score and TNM stages. We identified gene sets with differential methylation regions (DMRs) in Distal, TSS, gene body and TES. To understand the collaborative roles, TSS was compared with the other three DMRs, resulted in 12 groups of genes with collaborative differential methylation patterns (CDMPs). We found several groups of genes that show opposite methylation patterns in Distal and Genic regions compared to TSS region, and in general they are differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumors in TCGA RNA-seq data. IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) reveals AR/TP53 signaling network to be a major signaling pathway, and survival analysis indicates genes subsets significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence. Our results suggest that DNA methylation in Distal and Genic regions also plays critical roles in contributing to prostate tumorigenesis, and may act either positively or negatively with TSSs to alter gene regulation in tumors.",5.578,1612

Though PTB is heritable, genetic studies have not identified variants that account for its intergenerational risk, prompting the hypothesis that epigenetic factors may also contribute. The objective of this study was to evaluate DNA methylation from maternal leukocytes to identify patterns specific to PTB and its intergenerational risk. DNA from peripheral leukocytes from African American women that delivered preterm (24-34 weeks; N = 16) or at term (39-41 weeks; N = 24) was assessed for DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In maternal samples, 17,829 CpG sites associated with PTB, but no CpG site remained associated after correction for multiple comparisons. Examination of paired maternal-fetal samples identified 5,171 CpG sites in which methylation of maternal samples correlated with methylation of her respective fetus (FDR < 0.05). These correlated sites were enriched for association with PTB in maternal leukocytes. The majority of correlated CpG sites could be attributed to one or more genetic variants. They were also significantly more likely to be in genes involved in metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune pathways, suggesting a role for genetic and environmental contributions to PTB risk and chronic disease. The results of this study may provide insight into the factors underlying intergenerational risk for PTB and its consequences.",4.78,1724

However, there is a lack of information on how this epigenetic process differs in tumors originating at different sites in the stomach. The aim of this study is to assess the methylation profiles of the MLH1, MGMT, and DAPK-1 genes in cancerous tissues from different stomach sites. METHODS: Samples were acquired from 81 patients suffering stomach adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery for gastric cancer in the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital Kaunas Clinics in 2009-2012. Gene methylation was investigated with methylation-specific PCR. The study was approved by the Lithuanian Biomedical Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: The frequencies of methylation in cancerous tissues from the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the stomach were 11.1, 23.1, and 45.4%, respectively, for MLH1; 22.2, 30.8, and 57.6%, respectively, for MGMT; and 44.4, 48.7, and 51.5%, respectively, for DAPK-1. MLH1 and MGMT methylation was observed more often in the lower third of the stomach than in the upper third (p < 0.05). In the middle third, DAPK-1 promoter methylation was related to more-advanced disease in the lymph nodes (N2-3 compared with N0-1 [p = 0.02]) and advanced tumor stage (stage III rather than stages I-II [p = 0.05]). MLH1 and MGMT methylation correlated inversely when the tumor was located in the lower third of the stomach (coefficient, -0.48; p = 0.01). DAPK-1 and MLH1 methylation correlated inversely in tumors in the middle-third of the stomach (coefficient, -0.41; p = 0.01).

PRMT5 has been implicated in several types of tumors. However, the role of PRMT5 in cancer development remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we provide evidence that PRMT5 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and patient-derived primary tumors, correlated with increased cell growth and decreased overall patient survival. Arginine methyltransferase inhibitor 1 (AMI-1)strongly inhibited tumor growth, increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and induced apoptosis in mouse CRC xenograt model. AMI-1 also induced apoptosis and decreased the migratory activity in several CRC cells. In CRC xenografts AMI-1 significantly decreased symmetric dimethylation of histone 4 (H4R3me2s), a histone mark of type II PRMT5, but not the expression of H4R3me2a, a histone mark of type I PRMTs. These results suggest that the inhibition of PRMT5 contributes to the antitumor efficacy of AMI-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) identified FGFR3 and eIF4E as two key genes regulated by PRMT5. PRMT5 knockdown reduced the levels of H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s methylation on FGFR3 and eIF4E promoters, leading to decreased expressions of FGFR3 and eIF4E. Collectively, our findings provide new evidence that PRMT5 plays an important role in CRC pathogenesis through epigenetically regulating arginine methylation of oncogenes such as eIF4E and FGFR3.",6.359,930

Arginine methylation has been reported to regulate RNA processing, gene transcription, DNA damage repair, protein translocation, and signal transduction. Lysine methylation is best known to regulate histone function and is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. To better study protein methylation, we have developed highly specific antibodies against monomethyl arginine; asymmetric dimethyl arginine; and monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl lysine motifs. These antibodies were used to perform immunoaffinity purification of methyl peptides followed by LC-MS/MS analysis to identify and quantify arginine and lysine methylation sites in several model studies. Overall, we identified over 1000 arginine methylation sites in human cell line and mouse tissues, and  approximately 160 lysine methylation sites in human cell line HCT116. The number of methylation sites identified in this study exceeds those found in the literature to date. Detailed analysis of arginine-methylated proteins observed in mouse brain compared with those found in mouse embryo shows a tissue-specific distribution of arginine methylation, and extends the types of proteins that are known to be arginine methylated to include many new protein types. Many arginine-methylated proteins that we identified from the brain, including receptors, ion channels, transporters, and vesicle proteins, are involved in synaptic transmission, whereas the most abundant methylated proteins identified from mouse embryo are transcriptional regulators and RNA processing proteins.",14.018,1359

We tried to elucidate the role of three 3p21.3 TSGs: DLEC1, ITGA9 and MLH1, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed their expression pattern by qPCR in 59 NSCLC tissues and in the matched macroscopically unchanged lung tissues. Additionally, we analyzed gene promoter methylation status by methylation-specific PCR in NSCLC samples. We did not find significant correlations between gene expression and methylation. In case of DLEC1 and ITGA9, expression levels were decreased in 71-78 % of tumor samples and significantly different between tumor and normal tissues (P = 0.0001). It could point to their diagnostic value. ITGA9 could also be regarded as a diagnostic marker differentiating NSCLC subtypes, as its expression level was significantly lower in squamous cell carcinoma (P = 0.001). The simultaneous down-regulation of DLEC1 and ITGA9 was observed in 52.5 % of NSCLCs. MSPs revealed high frequencies of gene promoter methylation in NSCLCs: 84 % for DLEC1 and MLH1 and 57 % for ITGA9. Methylation indexes reflected moderate gene methylation levels: 34 % for ITGA9, 27 % for MLH1 and 26 % for DLEC1.

SNP1 [c.G1357A (p.Val376Ile)] creating one CpG site located in exon 8 was named L1 locus, and SNP2 (c.G1479A) located in exon 9 was named L2 locus. Individuals were divided into three genotypes, AA, AG and GG according to L1 locus (GG genotype had one more CpG site because of the mutation), and into two genotypes, AA- and GG-based on L2 locus. The results showed that only L1 locus was significantly associated with body weight (P < 0.01), gonad weight (P </= 0.05), triiodothyronine (T3) level (P </= 0.05) and mRNA expression (P < 0.01). At L1 locus, newly created CpG site in GG genotype was highly methylated (93.3 %), while there was no difference of methylation level in the other two CpG sites among three genotypes.

The HDAC inhibitors vorinostat, mocetinostat and entinostat induced 400-600% hyperacetylation in HEK 293 and K562 cells. All HDAC inhibitors decreased histone methylarginines in HEK 293 cells but entinostat produced dose dependent reductions in asymmetric dimethylarginine, not observed in K562 cells. Vorinostat produced increases in histone lysine methylation and decreased expression of some lysine demethylases (KDM), measured by quantitative PCR.

METHODS: 180 cases of workers exposed to coal tar pitch in a certain carbon plant named as exposure group, and 145 healthy cases with a medical examination in the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University were selected as control group. Relative telomere length in peripheral blood DNA was detected using real-time quantitative PCR, and the promoter methylation rate of p16, RASSF1A and FHIT gene in peripheral blood DNA were determined by real-time quantitative methylation specific PCR. The relative telomere length and gene promoter methylation in two groups were compared, and influencing factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Relative telomere length in exposed group was lower than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (Z = -5.395, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the promoter methylation rate of p16, FHIT and RASSF1A gene between the two groups (P > 0.05). Stratification analysis by gender, age, and smoking, we found that when the age was less than or equal to 40, the promoter methylation rate of p16 in exposed group was more than that in control group, and the difference was statistically significant (Z = -1.914, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to coal tar pitch may induce leukocyte DNA telomere length of human peripheral blood shortened, and may not change the promoter methylation rates of p16, FHIT and RASSF1A gene.",0,405

In addition to loss, promoter methylation can participate in gene silencing and promote tumor aggressiveness. We have performed a complete mapping of promoter methylation at 3p11-p14 in two independent cohorts of cervical cancer patients (n = 149, n = 121), using Illumina 450K methylation arrays. The aim was to investigate whether hyperm-ethylation was frequent and could contribute to gene silencing and disease aggressiveness either alone or combined with loss. By comparing the methylation level of individual CpG sites with corresponding data of normal cervical tissue, 26 out of 41 genes were found to be hypermethylated in both cohorts. The frequency of patients with hypermethylation of these genes was found to be higher at tumor stages of 3 and 4 than in stage 1 tumors. Seventeen of the 26 genes were transcriptionally downregulated in cancer compared to normal tissue, whereof 6 genes showed a significant correlation between methylation and expression. Integrated analysis of methylation, gene dosage, and expression of the 26 hypermethylated genes identified 3 regulation patterns encompassing 8 hypermethylated genes; a methylation driven pattern (C3orf14, GPR27, ZNF717), a gene dosage driven pattern (THOC7, PSMD6), and a combined methylation and gene dosage driven pattern (FHIT, ADAMTS9, LRIG1). In survival analysis, patients with both hypermethylation and loss of LRIG1 had a worse outcome compared to those harboring only hypermethylation or none of the events. C3orf14 emerged as a novel methylation regulated suppressor gene, for which knockdown was found to promote invasive growth in human papilloma virus (HPV)-transformed keratinocytes. In conclusion, hypermethylation at 3p11-p14 is common in cervical cancer and may exert a selection pressure during carcinogenesis alone or combined with loss.

26842353,IDLN-MSP: Idiolocal normalization of real-time methylation-specific PCR for genetic imbalanced DNA specimens.,"['Santourlidis S', 'Ghanjati F', 'Beermann A', 'Hermanns T', 'Poyet C']",BioTechniques,2016,"Sensitive, accurate, and reliable measurements of tumor cell-specific DNA methylation changes are of fundamental importance in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. Real-time methylation-specific PCR (MSP) using intercalating dyes is an established method of choice for this purpose. Here we present a simple but crucial adaptation of this widely applied method that overcomes a major obstacle: genetic abnormalities in the DNA samples, such as aneuploidy or copy number variations, that could result in inaccurate results due to improper normalization if the copy numbers of the target and reference sequences are not the same. In our idiolocal normalization (IDLN) method, the locus for the normalizing, methylation-independent reference amplification is chosen close to the locus of the methylation-dependent target amplification. This ensures that the copy numbers of both the target and reference sequences will be identical in most cases if they are close enough to each other, resulting in accurate normalization and reliable comparative measurements of DNA methylation in clinical samples when using real-time MSP.",2.948,1620
27153114,A Systematic Analysis of the Relationship of CDH13 Promoter Methylation and Breast Cancer Risk and Prognosis.,"['Yang J', 'Niu H', 'Huang Y', 'Yang K']",PloS one,2016,"BACKGROUND: CDH13 (cadherin 13) is a special cadherin cell adhesion molecule, and the methylation of its promoter causes inactivation in a considerable number of human cancers. To explore the association between CDH13 promoter methylation and breast cancer risk and prognosis, we systematically integrated published articles to investigate the diagnostic performance of the CDH13 methylation test for breast cancer. An independent DNA methylation microarray dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) project was used to validate the results of the meta-analysis. METHODS: The relevant literature was searched using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for articles published in English up to May 2015. Data were analyzed using random effect or fixed effect models. The effect sizes were estimated by measuring an odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A chi-squared based Q test and sensitivity analysis were performed to examine the between-study heterogeneity and the contribution of single studies to the final results, respectively. Funnel plots were constructed to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Seven hundred and twenty-six breast tumor samples and 422 controls were collected from 13 published studies. The data from the TCGA set include both tumor and normal samples. A significant association was observed between CDH13 promoter methylation and breast cancer, with an aggregated OR equal to 13.73 (95%CI: 8.09~23.31, z = 9.70, p<0.0001) as measured using the fixed effect model and 14.23 (95%CI: 5.06~40.05, z = 5.03, p<0.0001) as measured using a random effect model. The HR values were calculated as 0.77 (95%CI: 0.27~2.21, z = -0.49, p = 0.622) and 0.38 (95%CI: 0.09~1.69, z = -1.27, p = 0.20) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively, using the random effect model. This result indicated that breast cancer patients with CDH13 promoter methylation correlated non-significantly with prognosis and is therefore similar to the findings of the TCGA project. CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of CDH13 promoter was strongly associated with breast cancer risk. However, CDH13 promoter methylation was not significantly related to the OS and DFS of breast cancer and may have limited prognostic value for breast cancer patients.",3.234,1778

Transcriptome-wide m(6)A patterns in Arabidopsis have been assayed recently. However, differential m(6)A patterns between organs have not been well characterized. RESULTS: Over two-third of the transcripts in Arabidopsis are modified by m(6)A. In contrast to a recent observation of m(6)A enrichment in 5' mRNA, we find that m(6)A is distributed predominantly near stop codons. Interestingly, 85 % of the modified transcripts show high m(6)A methylation extent compared to their transcript level. The 290 highly methylated transcripts are mainly associated with transporters, stress responses, redox, regulation factors, and some non-coding RNAs. On average, the proportion of transcripts showing differential methylation between two plant organs is higher than that showing differential transcript levels. The transcripts with extensively higher m(6)A methylation in an organ are associated with the unique biological processes of this organ, suggesting that m(6)A may be another important contributor to organ differentiation in Arabidopsis. Highly expressed genes are relatively less methylated and vice versa, and different RNAs have distinct m(6)A patterns, which hint at mRNA fate. Intriguingly, most of the transposable element transcripts maintained a fragmented form with a relatively low transcript level and high m(6)A methylation in the cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to comprehensively analyze m(6)A patterns in a variety of RNAs, the relationship between transcript level and m(6)A methylation extent, and differential m(6)A patterns across organs in Arabidopsis.",10.81,41

Aberrations in HOXA genes and their cofactor MEIS1 are found in human neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The present study investigated the role of HOXA4, HOXA5 and MEIS1 promoter DNA methylation and mRNA expression in AML. Samples from 78 AML patients and 12 normal bone marrow (BM) samples were included. The levels of promoter DNA methylation were determined using quantitative methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; qMSP) and the relative expression levels were measured using reverse transcription quantitative PCR in Ficollseparated BM mononuclear cells and in fluorescent activated cell sortingsorted populations of normal hematopoietic progenitors. In total, 38.1 and 28.9% of the patients exhibited high methylation levels of HOXA4 and HOXA5, respectively, compared with the control samples, and MEIS1 methylation was almost absent. An inverse correlation between HOXA4 methylation and expression was identified in a group of patients with a normal karyotype (NK AML). An association between the genes was observed and correlation between the DNA methylation and expression levels of the HOXA gene promoter with the expression of MEIS1 was observed. Patients with favorable chromosomal aberrations revealed a low level of HOXA4 methylation and decreased expression levels of HOXA5 and MEIS1 compared with the NK AML and the adverse cytogenetic risk patients. The NK AML patients with NPM1 mutations exhibited elevated HOXA4 methylation and expression levels of HOXA5 and MEIS1 compared with the NPM1 wildtype patients. Comparison of the undifferentiated BMderived hematopoietic CD34+CD38low, CD34+CD38+ and CD15+ cells revealed a gradual decrease in the expression levels of these three genes and an increase in HOXA4 promoter methylation. This differentiationassociated variability was not observed in AML, which was classified according to the FrenchAmericanBritish system.",1.554,645

Although it is well established that subtelomeric regions are methylated, the presence of methylated cytosines at telomeres has remained controversial. Here, we have analyzed multiple bisulfite sequencing studies to address the methylation status of Arabidopsis thaliana telomeres. We found that the levels of estimated telomeric DNA methylation varied among studies. Interestingly, we estimated higher levels of telomeric DNA methylation in studies that produced C-rich telomeric strands with lower efficiency. However, these high methylation estimates arose due to experimental limitations of the bisulfite technique. We found a similar phenomenon for mitochondrial DNA: The levels of mitochondrial DNA methylation detected were higher in experiments with lower mitochondrial read production efficiencies. Based on experiments with high telomeric C-rich strand production efficiencies, we concluded that Arabidopsis telomeres are not methylated, which was confirmed by methylation-dependent restriction enzyme analyses. Thus, our studies indicate that telomeres are refractory to de novo DNA methylation by the RNA-directed DNA methylation machinery. This result, together with previously reported data, reveals that subtelomeric DNA methylation controls the homeostasis of telomere length.",14.63,747

Therefore a change in the level of DNA methylation of whole genome has been considered as a biomarker of carcinogenesis. Previously, a large number of experimental results in genetic toxicology have showed that benzo[a]pyrene could cause DNA mutation and fragmentation. However, there was little to no studies on alterations in DNA methylation of genome directly result from exposure to benzo[a]pyrene. In this paper, possible mechanisms of alterations in whole genomic DNA methylation by benzo[a]pyrene were investigated using ICR mice after benzo[a]pyrene exposure. The blood, liver, pancreas, skin, lung and bladder of ICR mice were removed and checked after a fixed time interval (6 hours) of benzo[a]pyrene exposure, and whole genomic DNA methylation level was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results exhibited tissue specificity, that is, the level of whole genomic DNA methylation decreases significantly in blood and liver, rather than pancreas, lung, skin and bladder of ICR mice. This study investigated the direct relationship between aberrant DNA methylation level and benzo[a]pyrene exposure, which might be helpful to clarify the toxicological mechanism of benzo[a]pyrene in epigenetic perspectives.",5.808,267

To clarify this point, we applied the gold standard method for DNA methylation, bisulfite pyrosequencing, to examine human mtDNA methylation status. Before bisulfite conversion, BamHI was used to digest DNA to open the loop of mtDNA. The results demonstrated that the linear mtDNA had significantly higher bisulfite conversion efficiency compared with circular mtDNA. Furthermore, the methylation values obtained from linear mtDNA were significantly lower than that of circular mtDNA, which was verified by SEQUENOM MassARRAY. The above impacts of circular structure were also observed in lung DNA samples but not in saliva DNA samples. Mitochondrial genome methylation of blood samples and saliva samples from 14 unrelated individuals was detected. The detected regions covered 83 CpG sites across mtDNA including D-loop, 12 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, ND1, COXI, ND3, ND4, ND5, CYTB. We found that the average methylation levels of nine regions were all less than 2% for both sample types. In conclusion, our findings firstly show that the circular structure of mtDNA affects bisulfite conversion efficiency, which leads to overestimation of mtDNA methylation values. CpG methylation in human mtDNA is a very rare event at most DNA regions.",5.578,1965

Semen samples were obtained from 46 AS patients and 49 age-matched normal controls. DNA methylation levels of detected genes DMR were determined by MassARRAY quantitative methylation analysis. The average methylation level at the P16 and MEST DMRs was significantly lower in AS patients than in controls (patients 6.51 +/- 0.32%, controls 7.66 +/- 0.40%, P < 0.01). The methylation level of 6 CpG sites of P16 DMR, and 1 CpG site of MEST, GNAS, FAM50B and LINE-1 DMRs, was lower in AS group than in control group. For the first time, the data presented here suggest that increased methylation defects of P16 DMR may be associated with low sperm motility.

The objective of the current study was to identify predictors of progression to HSIL and determine what percentage of ASC-US/LSIL cases harbor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher. METHODS: The current study included 381 consecutive cases with ASC-US/LSIL. After the exclusion of 87 cases because of a history of dysplasia or loss to follow-up, 165 cases with follow-up cytology were used to analyze predictive factors of progression to HSIL, and 129 cases that underwent immediate tissue biopsy were subjected to correlation analysis between cytology and histology. Disease regression was defined as a reversion to normal or benign cellular changes, disease persistence as maintenance at ASC-US/LSIL, and disease progression as progression to HSIL. Data regarding clinical parameters were obtained from medical records. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed using cytology samples to evaluate methylation of the p16 promoter. RESULTS: Of 165 cases, 131 (79.4%) regressed, 23 (13.9%) were persistent, and 11 cases (6.7%) progressed. Human papillomavirus infection was more common in women with disease progression than in those with disease regression or persistence (P = .033). Promoter methylation of p16 in the cytology sample was more common in cases that progressed (5 of 6 cases) than in cases that regressed (0 of 8 cases). Twenty-three of 129 cases (17.8%) were found to harbor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher on immediate tissue biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus infection and p16 promoter methylation might be valuable surrogate markers of disease progression from ASC-US/LSIL to HSIL.",3.354,19

It constitutes an important reservoir of variation potentially useful for rapid adaptation in response to environmental stimuli. The analysis of population epigenetic structure represents a possible tool to study human adaptation and to identify external factors that are able to naturally shape human DNA methylation variability. The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics that create epigenetic diversity between and within different human groups. To this end, we first used publicly available epigenome-wide data to explore population-specific DNA methylation changes that occur at macro-geographic scales. Results from this analysis suggest that nutrients, UVA exposure and pathogens load might represent the main environmental factors able to shape DNA methylation profiles. Then, we evaluated DNA methylation of candidate genes (KRTCAP3, MAD1L1 and BRSK2), emerged from the previous analysis, in individuals belonging to different populations from Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, China and Italy, but living in the same Italian city. DNA methylation of the BRSK2 gene is significantly different between Moroccans and Nigerians (pairwise t-test: CpG 6 p-value = 5.2*10-3; CpG 9 p-value = 2.6*10-3; CpG 10 p-value = 3.1*10-3; CpG 11 p-value = 2.8*10-3).

In order to better understand immune response in the elderly, we studied epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles and humoral immune response outcomes in 50-74 year old healthy participants. Associations between DNA methylation and gene expression reveal a system-wide regulation of immune-relevant functions, likely playing a role in regulating a participant's propensity to respond to vaccination. Our findings show that sites of methylation regulation associated with humoral response to vaccination impact known cellular differentiation signaling and antigen presentation pathways. We performed our analysis using per-site and regionally average methylation levels, in addition to continuous or dichotomized outcome measures. The genes and molecular functions implicated by each analysis were compared, highlighting different aspects of the biologic mechanisms of immune response affected by differential methylation. Both cis-acting (within the gene or promoter) and trans-acting (enhancers and transcription factor binding sites) sites show significant associations with measures of humoral immunity. Specifically, we identified a group of CpGs that, when coordinately hypo-methylated, are associated with lower humoral immune response, and methylated with higher response. Additionally, CpGs that individually predict humoral immune responses are enriched for polycomb-group and FOXP2 transcription factor binding sites. The most robust associations implicate differential methylation affecting gene expression levels of genes with known roles in immunity (e.g. HLA-B and HLA-DQB2) and immunosenescence. We believe our data and analysis strategy highlight new and interesting epigenetic trends affecting humoral response to vaccination against influenza; one of the most common and impactful viral pathogens.",3.234,495

It is known that GDM is associated with an altered placental function and changes in placental gene regulation. More recent studies demonstrated an involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. So far, the focus regarding placental epigenetic changes in GDM was set on gene-specific DNA methylation analyses. Studies that robustly investigated placental global DNA methylation are lacking. However, several studies showed that tissue-specific alterations in global DNA methylation are independently associated with type 2 diabetes. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize global placental DNA methylation by robustly measuring placental DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) content and to examine whether differences in placental global DNA methylation are associated with GDM. METHODS: Global DNA methylation was quantified by the current gold standard method, LC-MS/MS. In total, 1030 placental samples were analyzed in this single-center birth cohort study. RESULTS: Mothers with GDM displayed a significantly increased global placental DNA methylation (3.22 +/- 0.63 vs. 3.00 +/- 0.46 %; p = 0.013; +/-SD). Bivariate logistic regression showed a highly significant positive correlation between global placental DNA methylation and the presence of GDM (p = 0.0009). Quintile stratification according to placental DNA 5mC levels revealed that the frequency of GDM was evenly distributed in quintiles 1-4 (2.9-5.3 %), whereas the frequency in the fifth quintile was significantly higher (10.7 %; p = 0.003). Bivariate logistic models adjusted for maternal age, BMI, ethnicity, recurrent miscarriages, and familiar diabetes predisposition clearly demonstrated an independent association between global placental DNA hypermethylation and GDM. Furthermore, an ANCOVA model considering known predictors of DNA methylation substantiated an independent association between GDM and placental DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that employed a robust quantitative assessment of placental global DNA methylation in over a thousand placental samples. The study provides large scale evidence that placental global DNA hypermethylation is associated with GDM, independent of established risk factors.",4.543,1246

In this expanded trial with subjects enrolled from another institution, we reexamine the diagnostic capabilities of the test to externally validate our previous study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWIST1 and NID2 gene methylation was assessed in DNA isolated from the urine of subjects at risk of bladder cancer undergoing cystoscopy for hematuria or bladder cancer surveillance. The diagnostic gold standard was cystoscopy. Two thresholds of TWIST1 and NID2 gene methylation were used for determining test result positivity, those published by Renard et al. and Abern et al. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic likelihood ratios, and receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for each gene, as well as their combination. In all, 3 methods were used to combine TWIST1 and NID2 into a single composite test: (1) believe-the-positive decision rule-if either gene is methylated the test result is positive, which maximizes test sensitivity; (2) believe-the-negative decision rule-if either gene is not methylated the test result is negative, which maximizes test specificity; and (3) a likelihood-based logistic regression model approach that balances sensitivity and specificity. Clinical utility was determined using a decision curve analysis. RESULTS: A total of 209 subjects were evaluated: 40% for hematuria and 60% for bladder cancer surveillance. Approximately 75% were male, most of the prior cancers being low-grade Ta. Using cystoscopy as the gold standard, areas under the curve were 0.67 for TWIST1, 0.64 for NID2, and 0.66 for combined TWIST1 and NID2. Decision rule results revealed optimization of sensitivity at 67% using Renard thresholds and specificity using the Abern thresholds at 69%. We found improved sensitivity (78%) in current smokers. Decision curve analyses revealed that the methylation assay provided only a modest benefit even at high probabilities of missed cancer. CONCLUSION: A urine DNA test measuring TWIST1 and NID2 methylation was externally examined with a larger cohort and its results continue to be poor. These 2 biomarkers are unlikely to replace cystoscopy, but they may be worthy of study in active smokers.",2.768,952

More than 90% of anal squamous cell carcinomas (ASCC) are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Studies on HPV-related anogenital lesions have shown that patterns of methylation of viral and cellular DNA targets could potentially be developed as disease biomarkers. Lesion-specific DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from existing or prospective patient cohorts may constitute a valuable resource for methylation analysis. However, low concentrations of DNA make these samples technically challenging to analyse using existing methods. We therefore set out to develop a sensitive and reproducible nested PCR-pyrosequencing based method to accurately quantify methylation at 10 CpG sites within the E2BS1, E2BS2,3,4 and Sp1 binding sites in the viral upstream regulatory region of HPV16 genome. Methylation analyses using primary and nested PCR-pyrosequencing on 52 FFPE tissue [26 paired whole tissue sections (WTS) and laser capture microdissected (LCM) tissues] from patients with anal squamous intraepithelial lesions was performed. Using nested PCR, methylation results were obtained for the E2BS1, E2BS2,3,4 and Sp1 binding sites in 86.4% of the WTS and 81.8% of the LCM samples. Methylation patterns were strongly correlated within median values of matched pairs of WTS and LCM sections, but overall methylation was higher in LCM samples at different CpG sites. High grade lesions showed low methylation levels in the E2BS1 and E2BS2 regions, with increased methylation detected in the E2BS,3,4/Sp1 regions, showing the highest methylation at CpG site 37. The method developed is highly sensitive in samples with low amounts of DNA and demonstrated to be suitable for archival samples.

Our group was the first to show the presence of epigenetic alterations in CTCs. METHODS: We present the development and analytical validation of a highly specific and sensitive Multiplex Methylation Specific PCR-coupled liquid bead array (MMSPA) for the simultaneous detection of the methylation status of three tumor and metastasis suppressor genes (CST6, SOX17 and BRMS1) in liquid biopsy material (CTCs, corresponding ctDNA) and paired primary breast tumors.

It has been hypothesized that changes in DNA methylation may mediate these long-term effects. We obtained DNA methylation profiles from cord blood and peripheral blood at ages 7 and 17 in the same children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Repeated-measures data were used to investigate changes in birth-related methylation during childhood and adolescence. Ten developmental phenotypes (e.g. height) were analysed to identify possible mediation of health effects by DNA methylation. In cord blood, methylation at 224 CpG sites was found to be associated with GA and 23 CpG sites with birth weight. Methylation changed in the majority of these sites over time, but neither birth characteristic was strongly associated with methylation at age 7 or 17 (using a conservative correction for multiple testing of P < 1.03 x 10(-7)), suggesting resolution of differential methylation by early childhood. Associations were observed between birth weight-associated CpG sites and phenotypic characteristics in childhood. One strong association involved birth weight, methylation of a CpG site proximal to the NFIX locus and bone mineral density at age 17. Analysis of serial methylation from birth to adolescence provided evidence for a lack of persistence of methylation differences beyond early childhood.

Reduced ALDH2 activity correlates with low alcohol tolerance and low risk for alcohol dependence. The ALDH2 promoter polymorphism rs886205 (A>G) is associated with decreased promoter activity, but a molecular mechanism and allele-dependent ALDH2 protein expression has not been described yet. On the basis of allele-dependent epigenetic effects, we analyzed the rs886205 genotype, methylation rates of cytosine-phosphatidyl-guanine (CpG)-sites within a regulatory promoter region and ALDH2 protein levels in 82 alcohol-dependent patients during a 2-week withdrawal and compared them to 34 matched controls. Patients without the G-allele of rs886205 showed higher methylation of the promoter region than controls and readily adapted epigenetically as well as on protein level during withdrawal, while patients with the G-allele displayed retarded methylation readjustment and no change in ALDH2 protein levels. Our data provide novel insights into an unknown genetic-epigenetic interaction, revealing impaired ALDH2 protein expression in patients with the G-allele of rs886205. Additionally, we checked for an association between rs886205 and protection against alcohol dependence and found a trend association between the G-allele and protection against alcohol dependence that needs replication in a larger Caucasian cohort.",2.101,1802

Transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin-ligand interactor (TACI) and B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) receptor (BAFF-R) are key receptors for T cell-independent IgA class switching by the binding of IgA-inducing cytokine a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and BAFF. Here we show decreased TACI and BAFF-R mRNA expression and hypermethylation of their corresponding genes TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C, respectively in the duodenal mucosa of dogs with IBD. To examine whether DNA methylation of the TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C influences the mRNA expression of TACI and BAFF-R, respectively, we first analyzed methylation and mRNA expression levels in vitro using 2 canine B lymphoid cell lines, GL-1 and CLBL-1. Methylation profiles in the cells were examined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) with primer pairs specific to methylated or unmethylated sequences. These methylation analyses revealed hypermethylation of the CpG islands of both TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C in GL-1, but not in CLBL-1 cells. The mRNA expression levels of TACI and BAFF-R were significantly lower in GL-1 than in CLBL-1 cells. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine significantly increased TACI and BAFF-R mRNA expression in GL-1 cells through demethylation of TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C, respectively. These results suggest that the mRNA expression of TACI and BAFF-R is regulated through methylation of their genes in canine B cells. Quantitative real-time MSP showed significant hypermethylation of the CpG islands of TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C in the duodenal mucosa of dogs with IBD. Furthermore, duodenal mRNA expression levels of TACI and BAFF-R were significantly lower in dogs with IBD than in healthy controls. The mRNA expression levels of TACI positively correlated with intestinal IgA expression, whereas the methylation level of its gene (TNFRSF13B) negatively correlated with IgA expression. The present results suggest the role of TACI in the regulation of mucosal IgA expression through epigenetic modifications.",1.535,403

Host factors like sex and age strongly influence biological variation of DNA methylation, but characterization of these relationships is still limited, particularly in young children. METHODS: In a sample of 111 Mexican-American subjects (58 girls , 53 boys), we interrogated DNA methylation differences by sex at birth using the 450 K BeadChip in umbilical cord blood specimens, adjusting for cell composition. RESULTS: We observed that ~3% of CpG sites were differentially methylated between girls and boys at birth (FDR P < 0.05). Of those CpGs, 3031 were located on autosomes, and 82.8% of those were hypermethylated in girls compared to boys. Beyond individual CpGs, we found 3604 sex-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) where the majority (75.8%) had higher methylation in girls. Using pathway analysis, we found that sex-associated autosomal CpGs were significantly enriched for gene ontology terms related to nervous system development and behavior. Among hits in our study, 35.9% had been previously reported as sex-associated CpG sites in other published human studies. Further, for replicated hits, the direction of the association with methylation was highly concordant (98.5-100%) with previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported epigenome-wide analysis by sex at birth that examined DMRs and adjusted for confounding by cell composition. We confirmed previously reported trends that methylation profiles are sex-specific even in autosomal genes, and also identified novel sex-associated CpGs in our methylome-wide analysis immediately after birth, a critical yet relatively unstudied developmental window.",3.986,343

Recent studies have identified biomarkers of chronological age based on DNA methylation levels. It is not yet known whether DNA methylation age captures aspects of biological age. RESULTS: Here we test whether differences between people's chronological ages and estimated ages, DNA methylation age, predict all-cause mortality in later life. The difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age (Deltaage) was calculated in four longitudinal cohorts of older people. Meta-analysis of proportional hazards models from the four cohorts was used to determine the association between Deltaage and mortality. A 5-year higher Deltaage is associated with a 21% higher mortality risk, adjusting for age and sex. After further adjustments for childhood IQ, education, social class, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and APOE e4 status, there is a 16% increased mortality risk for those with a 5-year higher Deltaage. A pedigree-based heritability analysis of Deltaage was conducted in a separate cohort. The heritability of Deltaage was 0.43.

While cancer tissue exhibits widespread DNA methylation changes, the proportion of tissue-specific versus tissue-independent DNA methylation alterations in cancer is unclear. In addition, it is unknown which factors determine the patterns of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer. RESULTS: Using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (450k), we here analyze genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of ten types of fetal tissue, in addition to matched normal-cancer data for corresponding tissue types, encompassing over 3000 samples. We demonstrate that the level of aberrant cancer DNA methylation in gene promoters and gene bodies is highly correlated between cancer types. We estimate that up to 60 % of the DNA methylation variation in a cancer genome of a given tissue type is explained by the corresponding variation in a cancer genome of another type, implying that much of the cancer DNA methylation landscape is tissue independent. We further show that histone marks in normal cells are better predictors of aberrant cancer DNA methylation than the corresponding signals in human embryonic stem cells. We build predictors of cancer DNA methylation patterns and show that although inclusion of three histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3) improves model accuracy, the bivalent marks are the most predictive. Finally, we show that chromatin accessibility of gene promoters in normal tissue dictates the promoter's propensity to acquire aberrant DNA methylation in cancer in so far as it determines its level of DNA methylation in normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that a considerable fraction of the aberrant cancer DNA methylation landscape results from a mechanism that is largely tissue specific. Histone marks as specified in the normal cell of origin provide highly predictive models of aberrant cancer DNA methylation and outperform those derived from the same marks in hESCs.",5.333,1256

Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation might be a molecular mechanism through which phthalate exposure affects fetal growth. In this study, we examined associations between prenatal phthalate exposure, infant growth, and global DNA methylation in human placenta samples. We measured global DNA methylation of 119 subjects [55 fetal growth restriction (FGR) cases and 64 normal controls], as assessed by long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, via quantitative polymerase chain reaction-pyrosequencing. Prenatal phthalate exposure was assessed by measuring maternal urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and SumDEHP (molar sum of MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP) were significantly higher in FGR cases than those in normal controls (P = 0.002, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively). Placental LINE-1 methylation were found to be positively associated with fetal birth weight standard deviation scores, and negatively associated with urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations (MEHHP and SumDEHP). Every natural-log unit increase in urinary concentrations of MEHHP and SumDEHP was associated with 0.015 (beta = -0.015, P = 0.150) and 0.012 kg (beta = -0.012, P = 0.167) decrease in birth weight mediated through LINE-1 methylation. These findings suggest that changes in placental LINE-1 methylation might be part of the underlying biological pathway between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse fetal growth.",2.63,490

We found that 150 of the approximately 1200 tumor-associated methylation peaks near transcription start sites (TSSs) were marked by H3K27me3 in melanocytes. DNA methylation in melanoma was specific for distinct H3K27me3 peaks rather than for broadly covered regions. However, numerous H3K27me3 peak-associated TSS regions remained devoid of DNA methylation in tumors. There was no relationship between BRAF mutations and the number of methylation peaks. Gene expression analysis showed upregulated immune response genes in melanomas presumably as a result of lymphocyte infiltration. Down-regulated genes were enriched for melanocyte differentiation factors; e.g., KIT, PAX3 and SOX10 became methylated and downregulated in melanoma.",2.284,1932

Two-thirds of preterm deliveries are idiopathic. The initiating molecular mechanisms behind spontaneous preterm delivery are unclear. Umbilical cord blood DNA samples are an easy source of material to study the neonatal state at birth. DNA methylation changes can be exploited as markers to identify spontaneous preterm delivery. To identify methylation differences specific to idiopathic preterm delivery, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation changes in 24 umbilical cord blood samples (UCB) using the 450 K Illumina methylation array. After quality control, conclusions were based on 11 term and 11 idiopathic preterm born neonates. The differentially methylated positions (DMPs) specific for preterm/term delivery, neonatal sex, use of oxytocin and mode of initiation of labor were calculated by controlling the FDR p value at 0.05. RESULTS: The analysis identifies 1855 statistically significant DMPs between preterm and term deliveries of which 508 DMPs are also attributable to clinical variables other than preterm versus term delivery. 1347 DMPs are unique to term vs preterm delivery, of which 196 DMPs do not relate to gestational age as such. Pathway analysis indicated enrichment of genes involved in calcium signalling, myometrial contraction and relaxation pathways. The 1151 DMPs that correlate with advancing gestational age (p < 0.05) include 161 DMPs that match with two previously reported studies on UCB methylation. Additionally, 123 neonatal sex specific DMPs, 97 DMPs specific to the induction of labour and 42 DMPs specific to the mode of initiation of labor were also identified. CONCLUSION: This study identifies 196 DMPs in UCB DNA of neonates which do not relate to gestational age or any other clinical variable recorded and are specific to idiopathic preterm delivery. Furthermore, 161 DMPs from our study overlap with previously reported studies of which a subset is also reported to be differentially methylated at 18 years of age.

UHRF1 recognizes hemimethylated DNA substrates via the SRA domain, but also repressive H3K9me3 histone marks with its TTD. With systematic mutagenesis and functional assays, we could show that chromatin binding further involved UHRF1 PHD binding to unmodified H3R2. These complementation assays clearly demonstrated that the ubiquitin ligase activity of the UHRF1 RING domain is required for maintenance DNA methylation. Mass spectrometry of UHRF1-deficient cells revealed H3K18 as a novel ubiquitination target of UHRF1 in mammalian cells. With bioinformatics and mutational analyses, we identified a ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) in the N-terminal regulatory domain of DNMT1 that binds to ubiquitinated H3 tails and is essential for DNA methylation in vivo. H3 ubiquitination and subsequent DNA methylation required UHRF1 PHD binding to H3R2. These results show the manifold regulatory mechanisms controlling DNMT1 activity that require the reading and writing of epigenetic marks by UHRF1 and illustrate the multifaceted interplay between DNA and histone modifications. The identification and functional characterization of the DNMT1 UIM suggests a novel regulatory principle and we speculate that histone H2AK119 ubiquitination might also lead to UIM-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNA methylation beyond classic maintenance.",12.413,1072

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase, a key adipogenic enzyme in rodents and humans, plays significant role in the regulation of adipocyte inflammation via a mechanism that involves the regulation of inflammatory gene expression. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1-related regulation of gene expression might be driven by changes in DNA methylation. We showed that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 overexpression causes the global hypomethylation of DNA, even as early as 12h after the induction of differentiation, with the greatest difference seen in mature adipocytes. In contrast, both the silencing of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene expression by siRNA and inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity resulted in DNA hypermethylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The analysis of the promoter methylation of 22 genes that are related to the inflammatory response showed that the level of methylation of CpG sites in interleukin-10 receptor a, interleukin-4 receptor a, interleukin-6 signal transducer, and transforming growth factor beta 1 promoters was strongly related to stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 expression or activity. The changes in methylation at CpG promoter sites correlated with differential expression of the aforementioned genes. The results show that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 regulates the level of DNA methylation in adipocytes and suggest that the mechanism by which stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 affects adipocyte inflammation may involve changes in the methylation of inflammatory genes.",0,1332

In this article, we propose a statistical model that allows us to pool information on the same probe across multiple samples to estimate the probe affinity effect, and to borrow strength from the neighboring probe sites to better estimate the methylation values.

There is an ongoing discussion whether pleomorphic ILC is a dedifferentiated form of ILC or in origin an IDC with a secondary loss of cohesion. Since gene promoter hypermethylation is an early event in breast carcinogenesis and thus may provide information on tumor progression, we set out to compare the methylation patterns of pleomorphic ILC, classic ILC and IDC. In addition, we aimed at analyzing the methylation status of pleomorphic ILC. METHODS: We performed promoter methylation profiling of 24 established and putative tumor suppressor genes by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) analysis in 20 classical ILC, 16 pleomorphic ILC and 20 IDC cases. RESULTS: We found that pleomorphic ILC showed relatively low TP73 and MLH1 methylation levels and relatively high RASSF1A methylation levels compared to classic ILC. Compared to IDC, pleomorphic ILC showed relatively low MLH1 and BRCA1 methylation levels. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a similar methylation pattern for pleomorphic ILC and IDC, while the methylation pattern of classic ILC was different.

Current advances have suggested that the metabolic syndrome (MS) is a programmable disease, which is characterized by epigenetic modifications of vital genes when exposed to oxidative stress. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to critically review the central context of MS while presenting the most recent knowledge related to epigenetic alterations that are promoted by oxidative stress. Potential pro-oxidant mechanisms that orchestrate changes in methylation profiling and are related to obesity, diabetes and hypertension are discussed. It is anticipated that the identification and understanding of the role of DNA methylation marks could be used to uncover early predictors and define drugs or diet-related treatments able to delay or reverse epigenetic changes, thereby combating MS burden.",4.649,1725

The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas belongs to lophotrochozoans and its larval development is highly dependent on temperature, but the role of epigenetic mechanisms in this context is unknown despite high levels of the recently characterized Jumonji histone demethylase (JHDM) orthologues (Cg_Jumonji) suggesting a physiological relevance of histone methylation in the oyster development. Because in other species alterations of the histone methylation pattern have deleterious outcomes, we investigated the influence of temperature during the oyster larval life on histone methylation and JHDM expression. To shed light on this point, oyster embryonic and early larval development experiments were carried out at different temperatures (18  degrees C, 25  degrees C and 32  degrees C). Histone methylation levels were investigated using fluorescent ELISA at 6 and 24h post-fertilization. When compared to the 25  degrees C group, at 18  degrees C H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 residues were hypomethylated at 6h post fertilization (hpf) and hypermethylated at 24 hpf. In contrast, at 32  degrees C, 6hpf animals present a dramatic hypermethylation (ca. 4-fold) of all examined residues, which is minored but sustained at 24 hpf. RT-qPCR investigations of the mRNA expression of the nine oyster JHDMs, showed gene- and stage-specific temperature sensitivities throughout the early life of oysters. This study provides evidence of the biological significance of histone methylation during development in a lophotrochozoan species. Our results also indicate that temperature influences histone methylation, possibly through the expression level of putative actors of its regulation, which might participate in developmental control. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating a direct relationship between an epigenetic mark and an environmental parameter in marine molluscs. Such investigations could help better understand the molecular mechanisms of development and adaptation in lophotrochozoans.",1.792,60

Local recurrence develops even in some patients who have histologically negative surgical margins. Minimal residual tumor cells may lead to locoregional recurrence despite clear histologic margins reported at the time of resection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To identify subclinical residual disease, the authors analyzed deep margin imprint samples collected on 1-layer nitrocellulose sheets. METHODS: Bisulfite-treated DNA samples from 73 eligible patients were amplified by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (QMSP) targeting 6 genes (deleted in colorectal cancer [DCC], endothelin receptor type B [EDNRB], homeobox protein A9 [HOXA9], kinesin family member 1A [KIF1A], nidogen-2 [NID2], and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B [NR2B]). QMSP values were dichotomized as positive or negative. Associations between the QMSP status of deep margin samples and clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Two-gene methylation combinations among the genes DCC, EDNRB, and HOXA9 were associated with decreased locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. The methylated gene combination of EDNRB and HOXA9 in margin imprints was the most powerful predictor of poor locoregional recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-8.46; P = .012) independent of standard histologic factors. In addition, methylation of both EDNRB and HOXA9 indicated a trend toward reduced recurrence-free survival (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 0.90-8.33; P = .075) and reduced OS (HR, 5.78; 95% CI, 0.75-44.7; P = .093) in multivariable analysis.

There is a significant overlap between differentially methylated genes in the placenta and the liver of the rat offspring. Several genes differentially methylated in rat placenta exposed to maternal diabetes are also differentially methylated in the human placenta of offspring exposed to gestational diabetes in utero. DNA methylation changes inversely correlate with changes in expression.

Previous studies show that mutations in RNF111 in human cancers are rare and RNF111 promotes lung tumor metastasis. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the role of RNF111 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis remain unknown. Here, we mainly focused on low- (95C) and high-metastatic (95D) NSCLC cell lines, which share a similar genetic background, and investigated the methylation-based regulation of RNF111 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clonal bisulfite sequencing, real-time qRT-PCR, western blot analysis, luciferase reporter assays, RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and transwell migration and invasion assays were performed on human NSCLC cell lines 95C and 95D. RESULTS: RNF111 was high-expressed in 95D cells, which showed low-level methylation at -459CpG site in RNF111 promoter. The opposite results were obtained in 95C cells. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed that -459CpG methylation can inhibit RNF111 transcriptional expression by interfering with the recruitment of Sp1 to RNF111 promoter. On TGF-beta stimulation, siRNA-mediated RNF111 knockdown inhibited TGF-beta/Smad signaling activity and Snail (an inducer of metastasis) expression, and enhanced E-cadherin (an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition marker) expression in 95C and 95D cells. Furthermore, demethylation-induced upregulation of RNF111 enhanced phosphorylation of SMAD3 and Snail expression, and repressed E-cadherin expression in 95C cells expressing low RNF111. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that -459CpG methylation in Sp1-binding site of RNF111 promoter transcriptionally decreases RNF111 expression, which inhibits TGF-beta/Smad signaling associated invasion in NSCLC cells.",0,497
27133805,Gene promoter DNA methylation patterns have a limited role in orchestrating transcriptional changes in the fetal liver in response to maternal folate depletion during pregnancy.,"['McKay JA', 'Adriaens M', 'Evelo CT', 'Ford D', 'Mathers JC']",Molecular nutrition & food research,2016,"SCOPE: Early-life exposures are critical in fetal programming and may influence function and health in later life. Adequate maternal folate consumption during pregnancy is essential for healthy fetal development and long-term offspring health. The mechanisms underlying fetal programming are poorly understood, but are likely to involve gene regulation. Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, regulate gene expression and are modifiable by folate supply. We observed transcriptional changes in fetal liver in response to maternal folate depletion and hypothesized that these changes are concomitant with altered gene promoter methylation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female C57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 2 or 0.4 mg folic acid/kg for 4 wk before mating and throughout pregnancy. At 17.5-day gestation, genome-wide gene expression and promoter methylation were measured by microarray analysis in male fetal livers. While 989 genes were differentially expressed, 333 promoters had altered methylation (247 hypermethylated, 86 hypomethylated) in response to maternal folate depletion. Only 16 genes had both expression and methylation changes. However, most methylation changes occurred in genomic regions neighboring expression changes. CONCLUSION: In response to maternal folate depletion, altered expression at the mRNA level was not associated with altered promoter methylation of the same gene in fetal liver.",4.603,720

Fructose consumption is considered a risk factor for the conditions that make up metabolic syndrome such as dyslipidemia. However, the pathogenetic mechanism by which fructose consumption leads to metabolic syndrome is unclear. Based on observations that epigenetic modifications are closely related to induction of metabolic syndrome, we hypothesized that fructose-induced metabolic syndrome is caused by epigenetic alterations. Male SD rats were designated to receive water or 20% fructose solution for 14 weeks. mRNA levels for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) was analyzed using Real-time PCR. Restriction digestion and real-time PCR (qAMP) was used for the analysis of DNA methylation status. Hepatic lipid accumulation was also observed by fructose intake. Fructose feeding also significantly decreased mRNA levels for PPARalpha and CPT1A. qAMP analysis demonstrated the hypermethylation of promoter regions of PPARalpha and CTP1A genes. Fructose-mediated attenuated gene expression may be mediated by alterations of DNA methylation status, and pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome induced by fructose relates to DNA methylation status.",2.297,1139

FUS1, NPRL2/G21 and RASSF1A are TSGs from LUCA region at 3p21.3, a critical chromosomal region in lung cancer development. The aim of the study was to analyze and compare the expression levels of these 3 TSGs in NSCLC, as well as in macroscopically unchanged lung tissue surrounding the primary lesion, and to look for the possible epigenetic mechanism of TSG inactivation via gene promoter methylation. METHODS: Expression levels of 3 TSGs and 2 DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3B, were assessed using real-time PCR method (qPCR) in 59 primary non-small cell lung tumors and the matched macroscopically unchanged lung tissue samples. Promoter methylation status of TSGs was analyzed using methylation-specific PCRs (MSP method) and Methylation Index (MI) value was calculated for each gene. RESULTS: The expression of all three TSGs were significantly different between NSCLC subtypes: RASSF1A and FUS1 expression levels were significantly lower in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and NPRL2/G21 in adenocarcinoma (AC). RASSF1A showed significantly lower expression in tumors vs macroscopically unchanged lung tissues. Methylation frequency was 38-76%, depending on the gene. The highest MI value was found for RASSF1A (52%) and the lowest for NPRL2/G21 (5%). The simultaneous decreased expression and methylation of at least one RASSF1A allele was observed in 71% tumor samples. Inverse correlation between gene expression and promoter methylation was found for FUS1 (rs = -0.41) in SCC subtype. Expression levels of DNMTs were significantly increased in 75-92% NSCLCs and were significantly higher in tumors than in normal lung tissue. However, no correlation between mRNA expression levels of DNMTs and DNA methylation status of the studied TSGs was found. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the potential role of the studied TSGs in the differentiation of NSCLC histopathological subtypes. The significant differences in RASSF1A expression levels between NSCLC and macroscopically unchanged lung tissue highlight its possible diagnostic role in lung cancer in situ recognition. High percentage of lung tumor samples with simultaneous RASSF1A decreased expression and gene promoter methylation indicates its epigenetic silencing. However, DNMT overexpression doesn't seem to be a critical determinate of its promoter hypermethylation.",3.093,539

METHODS: Fluorescent quantitative PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of G6PD in 130 children with G6PD deficiency. Sixty-five children without G6PD deficiency served as the control group. The methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting curve analysis and bisulfite PCR sequencing were used to analyze gene promoter methylation in 22 children with G6PD de fi ciency and low G6PD mRNA expression. The G6PD gene promoter methylation was analyzed in 44 girls with normal G6PD mRNA expression (7 from G6PD deficiency group and 37 from control group). RESULTS: Twenty-two (16.9%) children with G6PD deficiency had relatively low mRNA expression of G6PD; among whom, 16 boys showed no methylation, and 6 girls showed partial methylation. Among the 44 girls with normal G6PD mRNA expression, 40 showed partial methylation, and 4 showed no methylation (1 case in the G6PD group and 3 cases in the control group). CONCLUSIONS: Gene promoter methylation is not associated with G6PD deficiency in boys. Girls have partial methylation or no methylation in the G6PD gene, suggesting that the methylation may be related to G6PD deficiency in girls.",0,65

Previous studies have suggested that soy phytoestrogens might regulate DNA methylation at individual candidate gene loci and that they play a crucial role as potential therapeutic agents for prostate cancer. The purpose of our study was to examine the modulation effects of phytoestrogens on a genome-wide scale in regards to DNA methylation in prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and LNCaP were treated with 40 muM of genistein and 110 muM of daidzein. DNMT inhibitor 5-azacytidine (2 muM) and the methylating agent budesonide (2 muM) were used to compare their demethylation/methylation effects with phytoestrogens. The regulatory effects of phytoestrogens on DNA methylation were analyzed by using a methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation method coupled with Human DNA Methylation Microarrays (MeDIP-chip). We observed that the methylation profiles of 58 genes were altered by genistein and daidzein treatments in DU-145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In addition, the methylation frequencies of the MAD1L1, TRAF7, KDM4B, and hTERT genes were remarkably modified by genistein treatment. Our results suggest that the modulation effects of phytoestrogens on DNA methylation essentially lead to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Genome-wide methylation profiling reported here suggests that epigenetic regulation mechanisms and, by extension, epigenetics-driven novel therapeutic candidates warrant further consideration in future",2.362,735

In this study, we aimed to identify new methylation markers for the detection of high-grade CIN (CIN2/3 or worse, CIN2+) by using innovative genome-wide methylation analysis (MethylCap-seq). We focused on diagnostic performance of methylation markers with high sensitivity and high specificity considering any methylation level as positive. RESULTS: MethylCap-seq of normal cervices and CIN2/3 revealed 176 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) comprising 164 genes. After verification and validation of the 15 best discriminating genes with methylation-specific PCR (MSP), 9 genes showed significant differential methylation in an independent cohort of normal cervices versus CIN2/3 lesions (p < 0.05). For further diagnostic evaluation, these 9 markers were tested with quantitative MSP (QMSP) in cervical scrapings from 2 cohorts: (1) cervical carcinoma versus healthy controls and (2) patients referred from population-based screening with an abnormal Pap smear in whom also HPV status was determined. Methylation levels of 8/9 genes were significantly higher in carcinoma compared to normal scrapings. For all 8 genes, methylation levels increased with the severity of the underlying histological lesion in scrapings from patients referred with an abnormal Pap smear. In addition, the diagnostic performance was investigated, using these 8 new genes and 4 genes (previously identified by our group: C13ORF18, JAM3, EPB41L3, and TERT). In a triage setting (after a positive Pap smear), sensitivity for CIN2+ of the best combination of genes (C13ORF18/JAM3/ANKRD18CP) (74 %) was comparable to hrHPV testing (79 %), while specificity was significantly higher (76 % versus 42 %, p </= 0.05). In addition, in hrHPV-positive scrapings, sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ of this best-performing combination was comparable to the population referred with abnormal Pap smear. CONCLUSIONS: We identified new CIN2/3-specific methylation markers using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. The diagnostic performance of our new methylation panel shows higher specificity, which should result in prevention of unnecessary colposcopies for women referred with abnormal cytology. In addition, these newly found markers might be applied as a triage test in hrHPV-positive women from population-based screening. The next step before implementation in primary screening programs will be validation in population-based cohorts.",4.543,90
26446621,Influence of DNA methylation on positioning and DNA flexibility of nucleosomes with pericentric satellite DNA.,"['Osakabe A', 'Adachi F', 'Arimura Y', 'Maehara K', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Kurumizaka H']",Open biology,2015,"DNA methylation occurs on CpG sites and is important to form pericentric heterochromatin domains. The satellite 2 sequence, containing seven CpG sites, is located in the pericentric region of human chromosome 1 and is highly methylated in normal cells. In contrast, the satellite 2 region is reportedly hypomethylated in cancer cells, suggesting that the methylation status may affect the chromatin structure around the pericentric regions in tumours. In this study, we mapped the nucleosome positioning on the satellite 2 sequence in vitro and found that DNA methylation modestly affects the distribution of the nucleosome positioning. The micrococcal nuclease assay revealed that the DNA end flexibility of the nucleosomes changes, depending on the DNA methylation status. However, the structures and thermal stabilities of the nucleosomes are unaffected by DNA methylation. These findings provide new information to understand how DNA methylation functions in regulating pericentric heterochromatin formation and maintenance in normal and malignant cells.",5.784,170

During the winter months in Fairbanks, Alaska, severe temperature inversions lead to elevated concentrations of ambient PM smaller than 2.5 mum (PM2.5). Sled dogs represent an easily accessible environmentally exposed population that may yield findings informative for human health risk assessment. OBJECTIVES: In this pilot study, we evaluated whether ambient PM was associated with markers of global methylation in sled dogs. METHODS: Kennels were strategically recruited to provide a wide PM2.5 exposure gradient for the Fairbanks area. Continuous monitoring of ambient PM2.5 was conducted at each kennel during the winter of 2012/13 using a DustTrak 8530. Dogs received a physical examination and assessment of standard hematology and clinical chemistries. Global methylation was determined using the LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) and 5-Methycytosine (5-mC) quantification. RESULTS: Three sled dog kennels (n~30 dogs/kennel) were evaluated and sampled. The average PM2.5 concentrations measured for kennels A, B, and C were 90 mug/m(3), 48 mug/m(3), 16 mug/m(3) (p<0.0001), respectively. The average (standard deviation) global methylation percentage for each kennel measured by LUMA was 76.22 (1.85), 76.52 (1.82), and 76.72 (2.26), respectively. The average (standard deviation) global methylation percentage for each kennel measured by 5-mC was 0.16 (0.04), 0.15 (0.04), and 0.15 (0.05), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the three kennels and their average global methylation percentage either by LUMA or 5-mC. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we evaluated global methylation using LUMA and 5-mC and found no differences between kennels, though exposure to ambient PM2.5 was significantly different between kennels. As more information becomes available regarding immunologically-related canine genes and functionally active promoter subunits, the utility of this surrogate could increase.",0,487

However, it is not well known how tissue-specific methylation varies between different functional and structural components of genes and genomes. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data we here describe both CpG and non-CpG methylation profiles of whole blood and brain tissue in relation to gene features, CpG-islands (CGIs), transposable elements (TE), and their functional roles in an ecological model species, the great tit (Parus major). RESULTS: We show that hypomethylation at the transcription start site (TSS) is enriched in genes with functional classes that relate directly to processes specific to each tissue type. We find that 6877 (~21 %) of the CGIs are differentially methylated between blood and brain, of which 1186 and 2055 are annotated to promoter and intragenic regions, respectively. We observe that CGI methylation in promoter regions is more conserved between tissues compared to CGI methylation in intra and inter-genic regions. Differentially methylated CGIs in promoter and intragenic regions are overrepresented in genomic loci linked to development, suggesting a distinct role for CGI methylation in regulating expression during development. Additionally, we find significant non-CpG methylation in brain but not in blood with a strong preference for methylation at CpA dinucleotide sites. Finally, CpG hypermethylation of TEs is significantly stronger in brain compared to blood, but does not correlate with TE activity. Surprisingly, TEs showed significant hypomethylation in non-CpG contexts which was negatively correlated with TE expression. CONCLUSION: The discovery that TSS methylation levels are directly linked to functional classes related to each tissue provides new insights in the regulatory role of DNA-methylation patterns. The dominant sequence motifs for brain non-CpG methylation, similar to those found in mammals, suggests that a conserved non-CpG regulatory mechanism was already present in the amniote ancestor. The negative correlation between brain non-CpG methylation and TE activity (not found for CpG methylation) suggests that non-CpG is the dominant regulatory form of methylation in TE silencing.",3.986,687

The active and inactive chromatin states are heritable and can be maintained or even be amplified by positive feedback in a transgenerational manner. However, mechanisms controlling the transgenerational DNA methylation dynamics are largely unknown. As an approach to understand the transgenerational dynamics, we examined long-term effect of impaired DNA methylation in Arabidopsis mutants of the chromatin remodeler gene DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1) through whole genome DNA methylation sequencing. The ddm1 mutation induces a drastic decrease in DNA methylation of transposable elements (TEs) and repeats in the initial generation, while also inducing ectopic DNA methylation at hundreds of loci. Unexpectedly, this ectopic methylation can only be seen after repeated self-pollination. The ectopic cytosine methylation is found primarily in the non-CG context and starts from 3' regions within transcription units and spreads upstream. Remarkably, when chromosomes with reduced DNA methylation were introduced from a ddm1 mutant into a DDM1 wild-type background, the ddm1-derived chromosomes also induced analogous de novo accumulation of DNA methylation in trans. These results lead us to propose a model to explain the transgenerational DNA methylation redistribution by genome-wide negative feedback. The global negative feedback, together with local positive feedback, would ensure robust and balanced differentiation of chromatin states within the genome.",7.528,698

It is the most stable epigenetic mark and is widely studied for its role in major biological processes. Aberrant DNA methylation is observed in various pathologies, such as cancer. Therefore, there is a great interest in analyzing subtle changes in DNA methylation induced by biological processes or upon drug treatments. Here, we developed an improved methodology based on flow cytometry to measure variations of DNA methylation level in melanoma and leukemia cells. The accuracy of DNA methylation quantification was validated with LC-ESI mass spectrometry analysis. The new protocol was used to detect small variations of cytosine methylation occurring in individual cells during their cell cycle and those induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzadC). Kinetic experiments confirmed that inheritance of DNA methylation occurs efficiently in S phase and revealed a short delay between DNA replication and completion of cytosine methylation. In addition, this study suggests that the uncoupling of 5AzadC effects on DNA demethylation and cell proliferation might be related to the duration of the DNA replication phase.",4.78,792
