26402372 |Post-translational control of transcription factors: methylation
 ranks highly.| |['Carr SM', 'Poppy Roworth A', 'Chan C', 'La Thangue NB']| |The FEBS journal| 2015 |Methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histones has long
 been known to determine both chromatin structure and gene expression. In
 recent years, the methylation of non-histone proteins has emerged as a
 prevalent modification which impacts on diverse processes such as cell cycle
 control, DNA repair, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis and
 tumourigenesis. Many of these non-histone targets represent transcription
 factors, cell signalling molecules and tumour suppressor proteins. Evidence
 now suggests that the dysregulation of methyltransferases, demethylases and
 reader proteins is involved in the development of many diseases, including
 cancer, and several of these proteins represent potential therapeutic targets
 for small molecule compounds, fuelling a recent surge in chemical inhibitor
 design. Such molecules will greatly help us to understand the role of
 methylation in both health and disease. |

 Tumor (DNET) Characterized by Genome-Wide Methylation Analysis.| |['Heiland DH', 'Staszewski O', 'Hirsch M', 'Masalha W', 'Franco P', 'Grauvogel J', 'Capper D', 'Schrimpf D', 'Urbach H', 'Weyerbrock A']| |Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology| 2016 |Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNET) are considered to
 be rare, benign, and associated with chronic epilepsy. We present the case of
 a 28-year-old man with a history of epilepsy since age 12. Surgery of an
 occipital cortical lesion in 2009 revealed a DNET. Five years later, a
 recurrent tumor at the edge of the resection cavity was removed, and the
 tissue underwent an intensive diagnostic workup. The first tumor was
 unequivocally characterized as a DNET, but neuropathological diagnostics of
 the recurrent tumor revealed a glioblastoma. After 6 months, another
 recurrent tumor was detected next to the location of the original tumor, and
 this was also resected. An Illumina 450 K beadchip methylation array was
 performed to characterize all of the tumors. The methylation profile of these
 tumors significantly differed from other glioblastoma and epilepsy-associated
 tumor profiles and revealed a DNET-like methylation profile. Thus, molecular
 characterization of these recurrent tumors suggests malignant transformation
 of a previously benign DNET. We found increased copy number changes in the
 recurrent DNET tumors after malignant transformation. Modern high-throughput
 analysis adds essential molecular information in addition to standard
 histopathology for proper identification of rare brain tumors that present
 with an unusual clinical course. |
26458103 |Dynamic m(6)A mRNA methylation directs translational control of
 heat shock response.| |['Zhou J', 'Wan J', 'Gao X', 'Zhang X', 'Jaffrey SR', 'Qian SB']| Nature 2015 |The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is
 N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which has broad roles in RNA biology. In
 mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of m(6)A along mRNAs results in
 relatively less methylation in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) compared to
 other regions. However, whether and how 5'UTR methylation is regulated is
 poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the 5'UTR in translation
 initiation, very little is known about whether m(6)A modification influences
 mRNA translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, certain
 adenosines within the 5'UTR of newly transcribed mRNAs are preferentially
 methylated. We find that the dynamic 5'UTR methylation is a result of
 stress-induced nuclear localization of YTHDF2, a well-characterized m(6)A 
'reader'. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear YTHDF2 preserves 5'UTR
 methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the m(6)A 'eraser' FTO
 from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased 5'UTR methylation in the form
 of m(6)A promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a
 mechanism for selective mRNA translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70
 mRNA as an example, we demonstrate that a single m(6)A modification site in
 the 5'UTR enables translation initiation independent of the 5' end
 N(7)-methylguanosine cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of 5'UTR
 methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only
 expands the breadth of physiological roles of m(6)A, but also uncovers a
 previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock
 response. |
26227335 |Emerging roles of lysine methylation on non-histone proteins.| |['Zhang X', 'Huang Y', 'Shi X']| |Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS| 2015 |Lysine methylation is a common posttranslational modification
 (PTM) of histones that is important for the epigenetic regulation of
 transcription and chromatin in eukaryotes. Increasing evidence demonstrates
 that in addition to histones, lysine methylation also occurs on various
 non-histone proteins, especially transcription- and chromatin-regulating
 proteins. In this review, we will briefly describe the histone lysine
 methyltransferases (KMTs) that have a broad spectrum of non-histone
 substrates. We will use p53 and nuclear receptors, especially estrogen
 receptor alpha, as examples to discuss the dynamic nature of non-histone
 protein lysine methylation, the writers, erasers, and readers of these
 modifications, and the crosstalk between lysine methylation and other PTMs in
 regulating the functions of the modified proteins. Understanding the roles of
 lysine methylation in normal cells and during development will shed light on
 the complex biology of diseases associated with the dysregulation of lysine
 methylation on both histones and non-histone proteins. |
26295435 |Silver nanoparticle-induced hemoglobin decrease involves
 alteration of histone 3 methylation status.| |['Qian Y', 'Zhang J', 'Hu Q', 'Xu M', 'Chen Y', 'Hu G', 'Zhao M', 'Liu S']| Biomaterials 2015 |Silver nanoparticles (nanosilver, AgNPs) have been shown to
 induce toxicity in vitro and in vivo; however, the molecular bases underlying
 the detrimental effects have not been thoroughly understood. Although there
 are numerous studies on its genotoxicity, only a few studies have
 investigated the epigenetic changes, even less on the changes of histone
 modifications by AgNPs. In the current study, we probed the AgNP-induced
 alterations to histone methylation that could be responsible for globin
 reduction in erythroid cells. AgNP treatment caused a significant reduction
 of global methylation level for histone 3 (H3) in erythroid MEL cells at
 sublethal concentrations, devoid of oxidative stress. The ChIP-PCR analyses
 demonstrated that methylation of H3 at lysine (Lys) 4 (H3K4) and Lys 79
 (H3K79) on the beta-globin locus was greatly reduced. The reduction in
 methylation could be attributed to decreased histone methyltransferase DOT-1L
 and MLL levels as well as the direct binding between AgNPs to H3/H4 that
 provide steric hindrance to prevent methylation as predicted by the all-atom
 molecular dynamics simulations. This direct interaction was further proved by
 AgNP-mediated pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation assay. These changes,
 together with decreased RNA polymerase II activity and chromatin binding at
 this locus, resulted in decreased hemoglobin production. By contrast, Ag
 ion-treated cells showed no alterations in histone methylation level. Taken
 together, these results showed a novel finding in which AgNPs could alter the
 methylation status of histone. Our study therefore opens a new avenue to
 study the biological effects of AgNPs at sublethal concentrations from the
 perspective of epigenetic mechanisms. |
